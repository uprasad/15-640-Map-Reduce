CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
On	1
our	1
right	1
flank	1
commanded	1
by	1
Bagration,	1
at	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
begun.	1
Not	1
wishing	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
Dolgorukov's	1
demand	1
to	1
commence	1
the	1
action,	1
and	1
wishing	1
to	1
avert	1
responsibility	1
from	1
himself,	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
proposed	1
to	1
Dolgorukov	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
Bagration	1
knew	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
distance	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
flanks	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
six	1
miles,	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
messenger	1
were	1
not	1
killed	1
(which	1
he	1
very	1
likely	1
would	1
be),	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
(which	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
difficult),	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
before	1
evening.	1
	1
Bagration	1
cast	1
his	1
large,	1
expressionless,	1
sleepy	1
eyes	1
round	1
his	1
suite,	1
and	1
the	1
boyish	1
face	1
Rostov,	1
breathless	1
with	1
excitement	1
and	1
hope,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
catch	1
his	1
eye.	1
He	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
meet	1
His	1
Majesty	1
before	1
I	1
meet	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
give	1
the	1
message	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov,	1
hurriedly	1
interrupting	1
Bagration.	1
	1
On	1
being	1
relieved	1
from	1
picket	1
duty	1
Rostov	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
few	1
hours'	1
sleep	1
before	1
morning	1
and	1
felt	1
cheerful,	1
bold,	1
and	1
resolute,	1
with	1
elasticity	1
of	1
movement,	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
good	1
fortune,	1
and	1
generally	1
in	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
makes	1
everything	1
seem	1
possible,	1
pleasant,	1
and	1
easy.	1
	1
All	1
his	1
wishes	1
were	1
being	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
morning:	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
general	1
engagement	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
part,	1
more	1
than	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
orderly	1
to	1
the	1
bravest	1
general,	1
and	1
still	1
more,	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
perhaps	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
sovereign	1
himself.	1
The	1
morning	1
was	1
bright,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
horse	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
happiness.	1
On	1
receiving	1
the	1
order	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
horse	1
the	1
rein	1
and	1
galloped	1
along	1
the	1
line.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
rode	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
Bagration's	1
troops,	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
advanced	1
into	1
action	1
but	1
were	1
standing	1
motionless;	1
then	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
region	1
occupied	1
by	1
Uvarov's	1
cavalry	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
stir	1
and	1
signs	1
of	1
preparation	1
for	1
battle;	1
having	1
passed	1
Uvarov's	1
cavalry	1
he	1
clearly	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
cannon	1
and	1
musketry	1
ahead	1
of	1
him.	1
The	1
firing	1
grew	1
louder	1
and	1
louder.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
fresh	1
morning	1
air	1
were	1
now	1
heard,	1
not	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
musket	1
shots	1
at	1
irregular	1
intervals	1
as	1
before,	1
followed	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
cannon	1
shots,	1
but	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
volleys	1
of	1
musketry	1
from	1
the	1
slopes	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
before	1
Pratzen,	1
interrupted	1
by	1
such	1
frequent	1
reports	1
of	1
cannon	1
that	1
sometimes	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
not	1
separated	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
but	1
merged	1
into	1
a	1
general	1
roar.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
puffs	1
of	1
musketry	1
smoke	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
chase	1
one	1
another	1
down	1
the	1
hillsides,	1
and	1
clouds	1
of	1
cannon	1
smoke	1
rolling,	1
spreading,	1
and	1
mingling	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
He	1
could	1
also,	1
by	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
bayonets	1
visible	1
through	1
the	1
smoke,	1
make	1
out	1
moving	1
masses	1
of	1
infantry	1
and	1
narrow	1
lines	1
of	1
artillery	1
with	1
green	1
caissons.	1
	1
Rostov	1
stopped	1
his	1
horse	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
on	1
a	1
hillock	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
but	1
strain	1
his	1
attention	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
or	1
make	1
out	1
anything	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening:	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
smoke	1
men	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
were	1
moving	1
about,	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
behind	1
moved	1
lines	1
of	1
troops;	1
but	1
why,	1
whither,	1
and	1
who	1
they	1
were,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
out.	1
These	1
sights	1
and	1
sounds	1
had	1
no	1
depressing	1
or	1
intimidating	1
effect	1
on	1
him;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
they	1
stimulated	1
his	1
energy	1
and	1
determination.	1
	1
"Go	1
on!	1
Go	1
on!	1
Give	1
it	1
them!"	1
he	1
mentally	1
exclaimed	1
at	1
these	1
sounds,	1
and	1
again	1
proceeded	1
to	1
gallop	1
along	1
the	1
line,	1
penetrating	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
into	1
the	1
region	1
where	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
action.	1
	1
"How	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
there	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
but	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
well!"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
After	1
passing	1
some	1
Austrian	1
troops	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
(the	1
Guards)	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
action.	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
the	1
better!	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
it	1
close,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
riding	1
almost	1
along	1
the	1
front	1
line.	1
A	1
handful	1
of	1
men	1
came	1
galloping	1
toward	1
him.	1
They	1
were	1
our	1
uhlans	1
who	1
with	1
disordered	1
ranks	1
were	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
attack.	1
Rostov	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
way,	1
involuntarily	1
noticed	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
bleeding,	1
and	1
galloped	1
on.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
no	1
business	1
of	1
mine,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
ridden	1
many	1
hundred	1
yards	1
after	1
that	1
before	1
he	1
saw	1
to	1
his	1
left,	1
across	1
the	1
whole	1
width	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
an	1
enormous	1
mass	1
of	1
cavalry	1
in	1
brilliant	1
white	1
uniforms,	1
mounted	1
on	1
black	1
horses,	1
trotting	1
straight	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
across	1
his	1
path.	1
Rostov	1
put	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
full	1
gallop	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
these	1
men,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
clear	1
had	1
they	1
continued	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
speed,	1
but	1
they	1
kept	1
increasing	1
their	1
pace,	1
so	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
already	1
galloping.	1
Rostov	1
heard	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
their	1
hoofs	1
and	1
the	1
jingle	1
of	1
their	1
weapons	1
and	1
saw	1
their	1
horses,	1
their	1
figures,	1
and	1
even	1
their	1
faces,	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
distinctly.	1
They	1
were	1
our	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
advancing	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
cavalry	1
that	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
were	1
galloping,	1
but	1
still	1
holding	1
in	1
their	1
horses.	1
Rostov	1
could	1
already	1
see	1
their	1
faces	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
command:	1
"Charge!"	1
shouted	1
by	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
was	1
urging	1
his	1
thoroughbred	1
to	1
full	1
speed.	1
Rostov,	1
fearing	1
to	1
be	1
crushed	1
or	1
swept	1
into	1
the	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
French,	1
galloped	1
along	1
the	1
front	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
his	1
horse	1
could	1
go,	1
but	1
still	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
avoid	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
a	1
huge	1
pockmarked	1
fellow,	1
frowned	1
angrily	1
on	1
seeing	1
Rostov	1
before	1
him,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
inevitably	1
collide.	1
This	1
Guardsman	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
bowled	1
Rostov	1
and	1
his	1
Bedouin	1
over	1
(Rostov	1
felt	1
himself	1
quite	1
tiny	1
and	1
weak	1
compared	1
to	1
these	1
gigantic	1
men	1
and	1
horses)	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
occurred	1
to	1
Rostov	1
to	1
flourish	1
his	1
whip	1
before	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Guardsman's	1
horse.	1
The	1
heavy	1
black	1
horse,	1
sixteen	1
hands	1
high,	1
shied,	1
throwing	1
back	1
its	1
ears;	1
but	1
the	1
pockmarked	1
Guardsman	1
drove	1
his	1
huge	1
spurs	1
in	1
violently,	1
and	1
the	1
horse,	1
flourishing	1
its	1
tail	1
and	1
extending	1
its	1
neck,	1
galloped	1
on	1
yet	1
faster.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
passed	1
Rostov	1
before	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
shout,	1
"Hurrah!"	1
and	1
looking	1
back	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
foremost	1
ranks	1
were	1
mixed	1
up	1
with	1
some	1
foreign	1
cavalry	1
with	1
red	1
epaulets,	1
probably	1
French.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
more,	1
for	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
cannon	1
began	1
firing	1
from	1
somewhere	1
and	1
smoke	1
enveloped	1
everything.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
as	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
having	1
passed	1
him,	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
smoke,	1
Rostov	1
hesitated	1
whether	1
to	1
gallop	1
after	1
them	1
or	1
to	1
go	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
sent.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
brilliant	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
that	1
amazed	1
the	1
French	1
themselves.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
horrified	1
to	1
hear	1
later	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
mass	1
of	1
huge	1
and	1
handsome	1
men,	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
brilliant,	1
rich	1
youths,	1
officers	1
and	1
cadets,	1
who	1
had	1
galloped	1
past	1
him	1
on	1
their	1
thousand-ruble	1
horses,	1
only	1
eighteen	1
were	1
left	1
after	1
the	1
charge.	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
I	1
envy	1
them?	1
My	1
chance	1
is	1
not	1
lost,	1
and	1
maybe	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Emperor	1
immediately!"	1
thought	1
Rostov	1
and	1
galloped	1
on.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
level	1
with	1
the	1
Foot	1
Guards	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
about	1
them	1
and	1
around	1
them	1
cannon	1
balls	1
were	1
flying,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
because	1
he	1
heard	1
their	1
sound	1
as	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
uneasiness	1
on	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
faces	1
and	1
unnatural	1
warlike	1
solemnity	1
on	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
officers.	1
	1
Passing	1
behind	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
a	1
regiment	1
of	1
Foot	1
Guards	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
calling	1
him	1
by	1
name.	1
	1
"Rostov!"	1
	1
"What?"	1
he	1
answered,	1
not	1
recognizing	1
Boris.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
we've	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line!	1
Our	1
regiment	1
attacked!"	1
said	1
Boris	1
with	1
the	1
happy	1
smile	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
under	1
fire	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
	1
Rostov	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Have	1
you?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Well,	1
how	1
did	1
it	1
go?"	1
	1
"We	1
drove	1
them	1
back!"	1
said	1
Boris	1
with	1
animation,	1
growing	1
talkative.	1
"Can	1
you	1
imagine	1
it?"	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
describing	1
how	1
the	1
Guards,	1
having	1
taken	1
up	1
their	1
position	1
and	1
seeing	1
troops	1
before	1
them,	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
Austrians,	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
discovered	1
from	1
the	1
cannon	1
balls	1
discharged	1
by	1
those	1
troops	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line	1
and	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
action.	1
Rostov	1
without	1
hearing	1
Boris	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
	1
"With	1
a	1
message	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty."	1
	1
"There	1
he	1
is!"	1
said	1
Boris,	1
thinking	1
Rostov	1
had	1
said	1
"His	1
Highness,"	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
high	1
shoulders	1
and	1
frowning	1
brows	1
stood	1
a	1
hundred	1
paces	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
helmet	1
and	1
Horse	1
Guards'	1
jacket,	1
shouting	1
something	1
to	1
a	1
pale,	1
white	1
uniformed	1
Austrian	1
officer.	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
or	1
the	1
Emperor,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
spur	1
his	1
horse.	1
	1
"Count!	1
Count!"	1
shouted	1
Berg	1
who	1
ran	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
as	1
eager	1
as	1
Boris.	1
"Count!	1
I	1
am	1
wounded	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
hand"	1
(and	1
he	1
showed	1
his	1
bleeding	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
tied	1
round	1
it)	1
"and	1
I	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
front.	1
I	1
held	1
my	1
sword	1
in	1
my	1
left	1
hand,	1
Count.	1
All	1
our	1
family--the	1
von	1
Bergs--have	1
been	1
knights!"	1
	1
He	1
said	1
something	1
more,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
and	1
rode	1
away.	1
	1
Having	1
passed	1
the	1
Guards	1
and	1
traversed	1
an	1
empty	1
space,	1
Rostov,	1
to	1
avoid	1
again	1
getting	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
line	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
charged,	1
followed	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
reserves,	1
going	1
far	1
round	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
hottest	1
musket	1
fire	1
and	1
cannonade	1
were	1
heard.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
musket	1
fire	1
quite	1
close	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
behind	1
our	1
troops,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
expected	1
the	1
enemy	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
be?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"The	1
enemy	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
our	1
army?	1
Impossible!"	1
And	1
suddenly	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
panic	1
of	1
fear	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
battle.	1
"But	1
be	1
that	1
what	1
it	1
may,"	1
he	1
reflected,	1
"there	1
is	1
no	1
riding	1
round	1
it	1
now.	1
I	1
must	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
here,	1
and	1
if	1
all	1
is	1
lost	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
rest."	1
	1
The	1
foreboding	1
of	1
evil	1
that	1
had	1
suddenly	1
come	1
over	1
Rostov	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
confirmed	1
the	1
farther	1
he	1
rode	1
into	1
the	1
region	1
behind	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Pratzen,	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
troops	1
of	1
all	1
kinds.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
it	1
mean?	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
Whom	1
are	1
they	1
firing	1
at?	1
Who	1
is	1
firing?"	1
Rostov	1
kept	1
asking	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian	1
soldiers	1
running	1
in	1
confused	1
crowds	1
across	1
his	1
path.	1
	1
"The	1
devil	1
knows!	1
They've	1
killed	1
everybody!	1
It's	1
all	1
up	1
now!"	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
in	1
Russian,	1
German,	1
and	1
Czech	1
by	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
fugitives	1
who	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
"Kill	1
the	1
Germans!"	1
shouted	1
one.	1
	1
"May	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
them--the	1
traitors!"	1
	1
"Zum	1
Henker	1
diese	1
Russen!"	1
*	1
muttered	1
a	1
German.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Hang	1
these	1
Russians!"	1
	1
Several	1
wounded	1
men	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
words	1
of	1
abuse,	1
screams,	1
and	1
groans	1
mingled	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
hubbub,	1
then	1
the	1
firing	1
died	1
down.	1
Rostov	1
learned	1
later	1
that	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian	1
soldiers	1
had	1
been	1
firing	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
"My	1
God!	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
all	1
mean?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"And	1
here,	1
where	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
the	1
Emperor	1
may	1
see	1
them....	1
But	1
no,	1
these	1
must	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
scoundrels.	1
It	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
over,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
that,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!	1
Only	1
to	1
get	1
past	1
them	1
quicker,	1
quicker!"	1
	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
defeat	1
and	1
flight	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
Rostov's	1
head.	1
Though	1
he	1
saw	1
French	1
cannon	1
and	1
French	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights	1
just	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
he	1
could	1
not,	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to,	1
believe	1
that.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Rostov	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
near	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Pratzen.	1
But	1
neither	1
they	1
nor	1
a	1
single	1
commanding	1
officer	1
were	1
there,	1
only	1
disorganized	1
crowds	1
of	1
troops	1
of	1
various	1
kinds.	1
He	1
urged	1
on	1
his	1
already	1
weary	1
horse	1
to	1
get	1
quickly	1
past	1
these	1
crowds,	1
but	1
the	1
farther	1
he	1
went	1
the	1
more	1
disorganized	1
they	1
were.	1
The	1
highroad	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
was	1
thronged	1
with	1
caleches,	1
carriages	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
and	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian	1
soldiers	1
of	1
all	1
arms,	1
some	1
wounded	1
and	1
some	1
not.	1
This	1
whole	1
mass	1
droned	1
and	1
jostled	1
in	1
confusion	1
under	1
the	1
dismal	1
influence	1
of	1
cannon	1
balls	1
flying	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
batteries	1
stationed	1
on	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
Emperor?	1
Where	1
is	1
Kutuzov?"	1
Rostov	1
kept	1
asking	1
everyone	1
he	1
could	1
stop,	1
but	1
got	1
no	1
answer	1
from	1
anyone.	1
	1
At	1
last	1
seizing	1
a	1
soldier	1
by	1
his	1
collar	1
he	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
answer.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
brother!	1
They've	1
all	1
bolted	1
long	1
ago!"	1
said	1
the	1
soldier,	1
laughing	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
and	1
shaking	1
himself	1
free.	1
	1
Having	1
left	1
that	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
drunk,	1
Rostov	1
stopped	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
a	1
batman	1
or	1
groom	1
of	1
some	1
important	1
personage	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
him.	1
The	1
man	1
announced	1
that	1
the	1
Tsar	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
along	1
that	1
very	1
road	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dangerously	1
wounded.	1
	1
"It	1
can't	1
be!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
someone	1
else."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
him	1
myself,"	1
replied	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
self-confident	1
smile	1
of	1
derision.	1
"I	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
Emperor	1
by	1
now,	1
after	1
the	1
times	1
I've	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
you....	1
There	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
as	1
pale	1
as	1
anything.	1
How	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
four	1
black	1
horses	1
fly!	1
Gracious	1
me,	1
they	1
did	1
rattle	1
past!	1
It's	1
time	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
Imperial	1
horses	1
and	1
Ilya	1
Ivanych.	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
Ilya	1
drives	1
anyone	1
except	1
the	1
Tsar!"	1
	1
Rostov	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ride	1
on,	1
when	1
a	1
wounded	1
officer	1
passing	1
by	1
addressed	1
him:	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"The	1
commander-in-chief?	1
He	1
was	1
killed	1
by	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball--struck	1
in	1
the	1
breast	1
before	1
our	1
regiment."	1
	1
"Not	1
killed--wounded!"	1
another	1
officer	1
corrected	1
him.	1
	1
"Who?	1
Kutuzov?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Not	1
Kutuzov,	1
but	1
what's	1
his	1
name--well,	1
never	1
mind...	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
left	1
alive.	1
Go	1
that	1
way,	1
to	1
that	1
village,	1
all	1
the	1
commanders	1
are	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Hosjeradek,	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
on.	1
	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
footpace	1
not	1
knowing	1
why	1
or	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
going.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
wounded,	1
the	1
battle	1
lost.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
doubt	1
it	1
now.	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
turrets	1
and	1
a	1
church.	1
What	1
need	1
to	1
hurry?	1
What	1
was	1
he	1
now	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar	1
or	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
alive	1
and	1
unwounded?	1
	1
"Take	1
this	1
road,	1
your	1
honor,	1
that	1
way	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
killed	1
at	1
once!"	1
a	1
soldier	1
shouted	1
to	1
him.	1
"They'd	1
kill	1
you	1
there!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about?"	1
said	1
another.	1
"Where	1
is	1
he	1
to	1
go?	1
That	1
way	1
is	1
nearer."	1
	1
Rostov	1
considered,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
where	1
they	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
now.	1
If	1
the	1
Emperor	1
is	1
wounded,	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
save	1
myself?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
He	1
rode	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
region	1
where	1
the	1
greatest	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
had	1
perished	1
in	1
fleeing	1
from	1
Pratzen.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
occupied	1
that	1
region,	1
and	1
the	1
Russians--the	1
uninjured	1
and	1
slightly	1
wounded--had	1
left	1
it	1
long	1
ago.	1
All	1
about	1
the	1
field,	1
like	1
heaps	1
of	1
manure	1
on	1
well-kept	1
plowland,	1
lay	1
from	1
ten	1
to	1
fifteen	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded	1
to	1
each	1
couple	1
of	1
acres.	1
The	1
wounded	1
crept	1
together	1
in	1
twos	1
and	1
threes	1
and	1
one	1
could	1
hear	1
their	1
distressing	1
screams	1
and	1
groans,	1
sometimes	1
feigned--or	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
a	1
trot	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
all	1
these	1
suffering	1
men,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
afraid--afraid	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
life,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
courage	1
he	1
needed	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
would	1
not	1
stand	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
these	1
unfortunates.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
who	1
had	1
ceased	1
firing	1
at	1
this	1
field	1
strewn	1
with	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
left	1
to	1
fire	1
at,	1
on	1
seeing	1
an	1
adjutant	1
riding	1
over	1
it	1
trained	1
a	1
gun	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
fired	1
several	1
shots.	1
The	1
sensation	1
of	1
those	1
terrible	1
whistling	1
sounds	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
corpses	1
around	1
him	1
merged	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
mind	1
into	1
a	1
single	1
feeling	1
of	1
terror	1
and	1
pity	1
for	1
himself.	1
He	1
remembered	1
his	1
mother's	1
last	1
letter.	1
"What	1
would	1
she	1
feel,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"if	1
she	1
saw	1
me	1
here	1
now	1
on	1
this	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
cannon	1
aimed	1
at	1
me?"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Hosjeradek	1
there	1
were	1
Russian	1
troops	1
retiring	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
who	1
though	1
still	1
in	1
some	1
confusion	1
were	1
less	1
disordered.	1
The	1
French	1
cannon	1
did	1
not	1
reach	1
there	1
and	1
the	1
musketry	1
fire	1
sounded	1
far	1
away.	1
Here	1
everyone	1
clearly	1
saw	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
lost.	1
No	1
one	1
whom	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
could	1
tell	1
him	1
where	1
the	1
Emperor	1
or	1
Kutuzov	1
was.	1
Some	1
said	1
the	1
report	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
wounded	1
was	1
correct,	1
others	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not,	1
and	1
explained	1
the	1
false	1
rumor	1
that	1
had	1
spread	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
carriage	1
had	1
really	1
galloped	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
pale	1
and	1
terrified	1
Ober-Hofmarschal	1
Count	1
Tolstoy,	1
who	1
had	1
ridden	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
battlefield	1
with	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
suite.	1
One	1
officer	1
told	1
Rostov	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
someone	1
from	1
headquarters	1
behind	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
thither	1
Rostov	1
rode,	1
not	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
anyone	1
but	1
merely	1
to	1
ease	1
his	1
conscience.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
ridden	1
about	1
two	1
miles	1
and	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
he	1
saw,	1
near	1
a	1
kitchen	1
garden	1
with	1
a	1
ditch	1
round	1
it,	1
two	1
men	1
on	1
horseback	1
facing	1
the	1
ditch.	1
One	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
plume	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
seemed	1
familiar	1
to	1
Rostov;	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
a	1
beautiful	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
(which	1
Rostov	1
fancied	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
before)	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ditch,	1
struck	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
spurs,	1
and	1
giving	1
it	1
the	1
rein	1
leaped	1
lightly	1
over.	1
Only	1
a	1
little	1
earth	1
crumbled	1
from	1
the	1
bank	1
under	1
the	1
horse's	1
hind	1
hoofs.	1
Turning	1
the	1
horse	1
sharply,	1
he	1
again	1
jumped	1
the	1
ditch,	1
and	1
deferentially	1
addressed	1
the	1
horseman	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
plumes,	1
evidently	1
suggesting	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
the	1
same.	1
The	1
rider,	1
whose	1
figure	1
seemed	1
familiar	1
to	1
Rostov	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
riveted	1
his	1
attention,	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
refusal	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
hand	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
gesture	1
Rostov	1
instantly	1
recognized	1
his	1
lamented	1
and	1
adored	1
monarch.	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
he,	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
empty	1
field!"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Alexander	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
beloved	1
features	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
deeply	1
engraved	1
on	1
his	1
memory.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
pale,	1
his	1
cheeks	1
sunken	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
hollow,	1
but	1
the	1
charm,	1
the	1
mildness	1
of	1
his	1
features,	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
greater.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
assurance	1
that	1
the	1
rumors	1
about	1
the	1
Emperor	1
being	1
wounded	1
were	1
false.	1
He	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
be	1
seeing	1
him.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
and	1
even	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
give	1
the	1
message	1
Dolgorukov	1
had	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
deliver.	1
	1
But	1
as	1
a	1
youth	1
in	1
love	1
trembles,	1
is	1
unnerved,	1
and	1
dares	1
not	1
utter	1
the	1
thoughts	1
he	1
has	1
dreamed	1
of	1
for	1
nights,	1
but	1
looks	1
around	1
for	1
help	1
or	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
delay	1
and	1
flight	1
when	1
the	1
longed-for	1
moment	1
comes	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
alone	1
with	1
her,	1
so	1
Rostov,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
attained	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
longed	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
reasons	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
why	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
inconvenient,	1
unseemly,	1
and	1
impossible	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
"What!	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
alone	1
and	1
despondent!	1
A	1
strange	1
face	1
may	1
seem	1
unpleasant	1
or	1
painful	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
of	1
sorrow;	1
besides,	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
now,	1
when	1
my	1
heart	1
fails	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
mouth	1
feels	1
dry	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
him?"	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
speeches	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
composed	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
could	1
he	1
now	1
recall.	1
Those	1
speeches	1
were	1
intended	1
for	1
quite	1
other	1
conditions,	1
they	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
victory	1
and	1
triumph,	1
generally	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
dying	1
of	1
wounds	1
and	1
the	1
sovereign	1
had	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
heroic	1
deeds,	1
and	1
while	1
dying	1
he	1
expressed	1
the	1
love	1
his	1
actions	1
had	1
proved.	1
	1
"Besides	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
ask	1
the	1
Emperor	1
for	1
his	1
instructions	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
nearly	1
four	1
o'clock	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
is	1
lost?	1
No,	1
certainly	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
approach	1
him,	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
intrude	1
on	1
his	1
reflections.	1
Better	1
die	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
than	1
risk	1
receiving	1
an	1
unkind	1
look	1
or	1
bad	1
opinion	1
from	1
him,"	1
Rostov	1
decided;	1
and	1
sorrowfully	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
full	1
despair	1
he	1
rode	1
away,	1
continually	1
looking	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
Tsar,	1
who	1
still	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
attitude	1
of	1
indecision.	1
	1
While	1
Rostov	1
was	1
thus	1
arguing	1
with	1
himself	1
and	1
riding	1
sadly	1
away,	1
Captain	1
von	1
Toll	1
chanced	1
to	1
ride	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
spot,	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
Emperor	1
at	1
once	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
offered	1
his	1
services,	1
and	1
assisted	1
him	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
ditch	1
on	1
foot.	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
wishing	1
to	1
rest	1
and	1
feeling	1
unwell,	1
sat	1
down	1
under	1
an	1
apple	1
tree	1
and	1
von	1
Toll	1
remained	1
beside	1
him.	1
Rostov	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
saw	1
with	1
envy	1
and	1
remorse	1
how	1
von	1
Toll	1
spoke	1
long	1
and	1
warmly	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
evidently	1
weeping,	1
covered	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
pressed	1
von	1
Toll's	1
hand.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
place!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
hardly	1
restraining	1
his	1
tears	1
of	1
pity	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
he	1
rode	1
on	1
in	1
utter	1
despair,	1
not	1
knowing	1
where	1
to	1
or	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
riding.	1
	1
His	1
despair	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
greater	1
from	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
own	1
weakness	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
grief.	1
	1
He	1
might...	1
not	1
only	1
might	1
but	1
should,	1
have	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sovereign.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
unique	1
chance	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
devotion	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
it....	1
"What	1
have	1
I	1
done?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
galloped	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
beyond	1
the	1
ditch	1
now.	1
Only	1
some	1
carts	1
and	1
carriages	1
were	1
passing	1
by.	1
From	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
drivers	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff	1
were	1
not	1
far	1
off,	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
the	1
vehicles	1
were	1
going	1
to.	1
Rostov	1
followed	1
them.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
walked	1
Kutuzov's	1
groom	1
leading	1
horses	1
in	1
horsecloths.	1
Then	1
came	1
a	1
cart,	1
and	1
behind	1
that	1
walked	1
an	1
old,	1
bandy-	1
legged	1
domestic	1
serf	1
in	1
a	1
peaked	1
cap	1
and	1
sheepskin	1
coat.	1
	1
"Tit!	1
I	1
say,	1
Tit!"	1
said	1
the	1
groom.	1
	1
"What?"	1
answered	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
absent-mindedly.	1
	1
"Go,	1
Tit!	1
Thresh	1
a	1
bit!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
fool!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
spitting	1
angrily.	1
Some	1
time	1
passed	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
same	1
joke	1
was	1
repeated.	1
	1
Before	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
been	1
lost	1
at	1
all	1
points.	1
More	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
cannon	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
Przebyszewski	1
and	1
his	1
corps	1
had	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
arms.	1
Other	1
columns	1
after	1
losing	1
half	1
their	1
men	1
were	1
retreating	1
in	1
disorderly	1
confused	1
masses.	1
	1
The	1
remains	1
of	1
Langeron's	1
and	1
Dokhturov's	1
mingled	1
forces	1
were	1
crowding	1
around	1
the	1
dams	1
and	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
ponds	1
near	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Augesd.	1
	1
After	1
five	1
o'clock	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
Augesd	1
Dam	1
that	1
a	1
hot	1
cannonade	1
(delivered	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
alone)	1
was	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
numerous	1
batteries	1
ranged	1
on	1
the	1
slopes	1
of	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights,	1
directed	1
at	1
our	1
retreating	1
forces.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
rearguard,	1
Dokhturov	1
and	1
others	1
rallying	1
some	1
battalions	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
musketry	1
fire	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
cavalry	1
that	1
was	1
pursuing	1
our	1
troops.	1
It	1
was	1
growing	1
dusk.	1
On	1
the	1
narrow	1
Augesd	1
Dam	1
where	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
the	1
old	1
miller	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
his	1
tasseled	1
cap	1
peacefully	1
angling,	1
while	1
his	1
grandson,	1
with	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
rolled	1
up,	1
handled	1
the	1
floundering	1
silvery	1
fish	1
in	1
the	1
watering	1
can,	1
on	1
that	1
dam	1
over	1
which	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
Moravians	1
in	1
shaggy	1
caps	1
and	1
blue	1
jackets	1
had	1
peacefully	1
driven	1
their	1
two-horse	1
carts	1
loaded	1
with	1
wheat	1
and	1
had	1
returned	1
dusty	1
with	1
flour	1
whitening	1
their	1
carts--on	1
that	1
narrow	1
dam	1
amid	1
the	1
wagons	1
and	1
the	1
cannon,	1
under	1
the	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
wagon	1
wheels,	1
men	1
disfigured	1
by	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
now	1
crowded	1
together,	1
crushing	1
one	1
another,	1
dying,	1
stepping	1
over	1
the	1
dying	1
and	1
killing	1
one	1
another,	1
only	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
and	1
be	1
killed	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
	1
Every	1
ten	1
seconds	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
flew	1
compressing	1
the	1
air	1
around,	1
or	1
a	1
shell	1
burst	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
that	1
dense	1
throng,	1
killing	1
some	1
and	1
splashing	1
with	1
blood	1
those	1
near	1
them.	1
	1
Dolokhov--now	1
an	1
officer--wounded	1
in	1
the	1
arm,	1
and	1
on	1
foot,	1
with	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
some	1
ten	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
company,	1
represented	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
that	1
whole	1
regiment.	1
Impelled	1
by	1
the	1
crowd,	1
they	1
had	1
got	1
wedged	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
to	1
the	1
dam	1
and,	1
jammed	1
in	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
had	1
stopped	1
because	1
a	1
horse	1
in	1
front	1
had	1
fallen	1
under	1
a	1
cannon	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
were	1
dragging	1
it	1
out.	1
A	1
cannon	1
ball	1
killed	1
someone	1
behind	1
them,	1
another	1
fell	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
splashed	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
blood.	1
The	1
crowd,	1
pushing	1
forward	1
desperately,	1
squeezed	1
together,	1
moved	1
a	1
few	1
steps,	1
and	1
again	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Move	1
on	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
certainly	1
saved,	1
remain	1
here	1
another	1
two	1
minutes	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
death,"	1
thought	1
each	1
one.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
forced	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
dam,	1
throwing	1
two	1
soldiers	1
off	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
ran	1
onto	1
the	1
slippery	1
ice	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
millpool.	1
	1
"Turn	1
this	1
way!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
jumping	1
over	1
the	1
ice	1
which	1
creaked	1
under	1
him;	1
"turn	1
this	1
way!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
those	1
with	1
the	1
gun.	1
"It	1
bears!..."	1
	1
The	1
ice	1
bore	1
him	1
but	1
it	1
swayed	1
and	1
creaked,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
way	1
not	1
only	1
under	1
a	1
cannon	1
or	1
a	1
crowd,	1
but	1
very	1
soon	1
even	1
under	1
his	1
weight	1
alone.	1
The	1
men	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
pressed	1
to	1
the	1
bank,	1
hesitating	1
to	1
step	1
onto	1
the	1
ice.	1
The	1
general	1
on	1
horseback	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
dam	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
address	1
Dolokhov.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
hissed	1
so	1
low	1
above	1
the	1
crowd	1
that	1
everyone	1
ducked.	1
It	1
flopped	1
into	1
something	1
moist,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
in	1
a	1
pool	1
of	1
blood.	1
Nobody	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
look	1
or	1
thought	1
of	1
raising	1
him.	1
	1
"Get	1
onto	1
the	1
ice,	1
over	1
the	1
ice!	1
Go	1
on!	1
Turn!	1
Don't	1
you	1
hear?	1
Go	1
on!"	1
innumerable	1
voices	1
suddenly	1
shouted	1
after	1
the	1
ball	1
had	1
struck	1
the	1
general,	1
the	1
men	1
themselves	1
not	1
knowing	1
what,	1
or	1
why,	1
they	1
were	1
shouting.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
hindmost	1
guns	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
onto	1
the	1
dam	1
turned	1
off	1
onto	1
the	1
ice.	1
Crowds	1
of	1
soldiers	1
from	1
the	1
dam	1
began	1
running	1
onto	1
the	1
frozen	1
pond.	1
The	1
ice	1
gave	1
way	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
one	1
leg	1
slipped	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
right	1
himself	1
but	1
fell	1
in	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
waist.	1
The	1
nearest	1
soldiers	1
shrank	1
back,	1
the	1
gun	1
driver	1
stopped	1
his	1
horse,	1
but	1
from	1
behind	1
still	1
came	1
the	1
shouts:	1
"Onto	1
the	1
ice,	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
stop?	1
Go	1
on!	1
Go	1
on!"	1
And	1
cries	1
of	1
horror	1
were	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
crowd.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
near	1
the	1
gun	1
waved	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
beat	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
turn	1
and	1
move	1
on.	1
The	1
horses	1
moved	1
off	1
the	1
bank.	1
The	1
ice,	1
that	1
had	1
held	1
under	1
those	1
on	1
foot,	1
collapsed	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
mass,	1
and	1
some	1
forty	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
it	1
dashed,	1
some	1
forward	1
and	1
some	1
back,	1
drowning	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Still	1
the	1
cannon	1
balls	1
continued	1
regularly	1
to	1
whistle	1
and	1
flop	1
onto	1
the	1
ice	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
oftenest	1
of	1
all	1
among	1
the	1
crowd	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
dam,	1
the	1
pond,	1
and	1
the	1
bank.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
On	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
with	1
the	1
flagstaff	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
lay	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski	1
bleeding	1
profusely	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
uttering	1
a	1
gentle,	1
piteous,	1
and	1
childlike	1
moan.	1
	1
Toward	1
evening	1
he	1
ceased	1
moaning	1
and	1
became	1
quite	1
still.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
long	1
his	1
unconsciousness	1
lasted.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
again	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
alive	1
and	1
suffering	1
from	1
a	1
burning,	1
lacerating	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
it,	1
that	1
lofty	1
sky	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
till	1
now,	1
but	1
saw	1
today?"	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
thought.	1
"And	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
this	1
suffering	1
either,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
anything,	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
till	1
now.	1
But	1
where	1
am	1
I?"	1
	1
He	1
listened	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
approaching	1
horses,	1
and	1
voices	1
speaking	1
French.	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Above	1
him	1
again	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
lofty	1
sky	1
with	1
clouds	1
that	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
were	1
floating	1
still	1
higher,	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
gleamed	1
blue	1
infinity.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
those	1
who,	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
hoofs	1
and	1
voices,	1
had	1
ridden	1
up	1
and	1
stopped	1
near	1
him.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
Napoleon	1
accompanied	1
by	1
two	1
aides-de-camp.	1
Bonaparte	1
riding	1
over	1
the	1
battlefield	1
had	1
given	1
final	1
orders	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
batteries	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
Augesd	1
Dam	1
and	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
"Fine	1
men!"	1
remarked	1
Napoleon,	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
dead	1
Russian	1
grenadier,	1
who,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
a	1
blackened	1
nape,	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
stomach	1
with	1
an	1
already	1
stiffened	1
arm	1
flung	1
wide.	1
	1
"The	1
ammunition	1
for	1
the	1
guns	1
in	1
position	1
is	1
exhausted,	1
Your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
an	1
adjutant	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
batteries	1
that	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
Augesd.	1
	1
"Have	1
some	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
reserve,"	1
said	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
having	1
gone	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
he	1
stopped	1
before	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
with	1
the	1
flagstaff	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
dropped	1
beside	1
him.	1
(The	1
flag	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
as	1
a	1
trophy.)	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
fine	1
death!"	1
said	1
Napoleon	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Napoleon	1
who	1
said	1
it.	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
speaker	1
addressed	1
as	1
Sire.	1
But	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
buzzing	1
of	1
a	1
fly.	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
interest	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
forgot	1
them.	1
His	1
head	1
was	1
burning,	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
bleeding	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
above	1
him	1
the	1
remote,	1
lofty,	1
and	1
everlasting	1
sky.	1
He	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
Napoleon--his	1
hero--but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Napoleon	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
small,	1
insignificant	1
creature	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
now	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
that	1
lofty	1
infinite	1
sky	1
with	1
the	1
clouds	1
flying	1
over	1
it.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
meant	1
nothing	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
standing	1
over	1
him,	1
or	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
him;	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
glad	1
that	1
people	1
were	1
standing	1
near	1
him	1
and	1
only	1
wished	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
help	1
him	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
life,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
beautiful	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
today	1
learned	1
to	1
understand	1
it	1
so	1
differently.	1
He	1
collected	1
all	1
his	1
strength,	1
to	1
stir	1
and	1
utter	1
a	1
sound.	1
He	1
feebly	1
moved	1
his	1
leg	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
weak,	1
sickly	1
groan	1
which	1
aroused	1
his	1
own	1
pity.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
He	1
is	1
alive,"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
"Lift	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
up	1
and	1
carry	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
dressing	1
station."	1
	1
Having	1
said	1
this,	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
on	1
to	1
meet	1
Marshal	1
Lannes,	1
who,	1
hat	1
in	1
hand,	1
rode	1
up	1
smiling	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
congratulate	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
victory.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
remembered	1
nothing	1
more:	1
he	1
lost	1
consciousness	1
from	1
the	1
terrible	1
pain	1
of	1
being	1
lifted	1
onto	1
the	1
stretcher,	1
the	1
jolting	1
while	1
being	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
probing	1
of	1
his	1
wound	1
at	1
the	1
dressing	1
station.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
regain	1
consciousness	1
till	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
when	1
with	1
other	1
wounded	1
and	1
captured	1
Russian	1
officers	1
he	1
was	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
hospital.	1
During	1
this	1
transfer	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
stronger	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
speak.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
words	1
he	1
heard	1
on	1
coming	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
French	1
convoy	1
officer,	1
who	1
said	1
rapidly:	1
"We	1
must	1
halt	1
here:	1
the	1
Emperor	1
will	1
pass	1
here	1
immediately;	1
it	1
will	1
please	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
prisoners."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
prisoners	1
today,	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
army,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
probably	1
tired	1
of	1
them,"	1
said	1
another	1
officer.	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same!	1
They	1
say	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
Guards,"	1
said	1
the	1
first	1
one,	1
indicating	1
a	1
Russian	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards.	1
	1
Bolkonski	1
recognized	1
Prince	1
Repnin	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society.	1
Beside	1
him	1
stood	1
a	1
lad	1
of	1
nineteen,	1
also	1
a	1
wounded	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards.	1
	1
Bonaparte,	1
having	1
come	1
up	1
at	1
a	1
gallop,	1
stopped	1
his	1
horse.	1
	1
"Which	1
is	1
the	1
senior?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
prisoners.	1
	1
They	1
named	1
the	1
colonel,	1
Prince	1
Repnin.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
regiment	1
of	1
Horse	1
Guards?"	1
asked	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
"I	1
commanded	1
a	1
squadron,"	1
replied	1
Repnin.	1
	1
"Your	1
regiment	1
fulfilled	1
its	1
duty	1
honorably,"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
"The	1
praise	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
commander	1
is	1
a	1
soldier's	1
highest	1
reward,"	1
said	1
Repnin.	1
	1
"I	1
bestow	1
it	1
with	1
pleasure,"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
that	1
young	1
man	1
beside	1
you?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Repnin	1
named	1
Lieutenant	1
Sukhtelen.	1
	1
After	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
Napoleon	1
smiled.	1
	1
"He's	1
very	1
young	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
meddle	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
"Youth	1
is	1
no	1
hindrance	1
to	1
courage,"	1
muttered	1
Sukhtelen	1
in	1
a	1
failing	1
voice.	1
	1
"A	1
splendid	1
reply!"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
"Young	1
man,	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
far!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
been	1
brought	1
forward	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes	1
to	1
complete	1
the	1
show	1
of	1
prisoners,	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
attract	1
his	1
attention.	1
Napoleon	1
apparently	1
remembered	1
seeing	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield	1
and,	1
addressing	1
him,	1
again	1
used	1
the	1
epithet	1
"young	1
man"	1
that	1
was	1
connected	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
you,	1
young	1
man,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
feel,	1
mon	1
brave?"	1
	1
Though	1
five	1
minutes	1
before,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
carrying	1
him,	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
straight	1
on	1
Napoleon,	1
he	1
was	1
silent....	1
So	1
insignificant	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
interests	1
that	1
engrossed	1
Napoleon,	1
so	1
mean	1
did	1
his	1
hero	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
paltry	1
vanity	1
and	1
joy	1
in	1
victory	1
appear,	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
lofty,	1
equitable,	1
and	1
kindly	1
sky	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
understood,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
him.	1
	1
Everything	1
seemed	1
so	1
futile	1
and	1
insignificant	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
stern	1
and	1
solemn	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
that	1
weakness	1
from	1
loss	1
of	1
blood,	1
suffering,	1
and	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
death	1
aroused	1
in	1
him.	1
Looking	1
into	1
Napoleon's	1
eyes	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
insignificance	1
of	1
greatness,	1
the	1
unimportance	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
understand,	1
and	1
the	1
still	1
greater	1
unimportance	1
of	1
death,	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
alive	1
could	1
understand	1
or	1
explain.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
as	1
he	1
went:	1
"Have	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
attended	1
to	1
and	1
taken	1
to	1
my	1
bivouac;	1
let	1
my	1
doctor,	1
Larrey,	1
examine	1
their	1
wounds.	1
Au	1
revoir,	1
Prince	1
Repnin!"	1
and	1
he	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
away.	1
	1
His	1
face	1
shone	1
with	1
self-satisfaction	1
and	1
pleasure.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
carried	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
noticed	1
and	1
taken	1
the	1
little	1
gold	1
icon	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
hung	1
round	1
her	1
brother's	1
neck,	1
but	1
seeing	1
the	1
favor	1
the	1
Emperor	1
showed	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
they	1
now	1
hastened	1
to	1
return	1
the	1
holy	1
image.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
replaced,	1
but	1
the	1
little	1
icon	1
with	1
its	1
thin	1
gold	1
chain	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
upon	1
his	1
chest	1
outside	1
his	1
uniform.	1
	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
good,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
icon	1
his	1
sister	1
had	1
hung	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
with	1
such	1
emotion	1
and	1
reverence,	1
"it	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
if	1
everything	1
were	1
as	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
Mary.	1
How	1
good	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
help	1
in	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
what	1
to	1
expect	1
after	1
it	1
beyond	1
the	1
grave!	1
How	1
happy	1
and	1
calm	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
now	1
say:	1
'Lord,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me!'...	1
But	1
to	1
whom	1
should	1
I	1
say	1
that?	1
Either	1
to	1
a	1
Power	1
indefinable,	1
incomprehensible,	1
which	1
I	1
not	1
only	1
cannot	1
address	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
even	1
express	1
in	1
words--the	1
Great	1
All	1
or	1
Nothing-"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"or	1
to	1
that	1
God	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
sewn	1
into	1
this	1
amulet	1
by	1
Mary!	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
certain,	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
except	1
the	1
unimportance	1
of	1
everything	1
I	1
understand,	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
something	1
incomprehensible	1
but	1
all-important."	1
	1
The	1
stretchers	1
moved	1
on.	1
At	1
every	1
jolt	1
he	1
again	1
felt	1
unendurable	1
pain;	1
his	1
feverishness	1
increased	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
delirious.	1
Visions	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
wife,	1
sister,	1
and	1
future	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
tenderness	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
the	1
battle,	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
insignificant	1
little	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
this	1
the	1
lofty	1
sky,	1
formed	1
the	1
chief	1
subjects	1
of	1
his	1
delirious	1
fancies.	1
	1
The	1
quiet	1
home	1
life	1
and	1
peaceful	1
happiness	1
of	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
already	1
enjoying	1
that	1
happiness	1
when	1
that	1
little	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
with	1
his	1
unsympathizing	1
look	1
of	1
shortsighted	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
doubts	1
and	1
torments	1
had	1
followed,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
heavens	1
promised	1
peace.	1
Toward	1
morning	1
all	1
these	1
dreams	1
melted	1
and	1
merged	1
into	1
the	1
chaos	1
and	1
darkness	1
of	1
unconciousness	1
and	1
oblivion	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
doctor,	1
Larrey,	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
end	1
in	1
death	1
than	1
in	1
convalescence.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
nervous,	1
bilious	1
subject,"	1
said	1
Larrey,	1
"and	1
will	1
not	1
recover."	1
	1
And	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
others	1
fatally	1
wounded,	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
district.	1

there.	1
Meeting	1
a	1
comrade	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
post	1
station	1
but	1
one	1
before	1
Moscow,	1
Denisov	1
had	1
drunk	1
three	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine	1
with	1
him	1
and,	1
despite	1
the	1
jolting	1
ruts	1
across	1
the	1
snow-covered	1
road,	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
wake	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sleigh	1
beside	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
impatient	1
the	1
nearer	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"How	1
much	1
longer?	1
How	1
much	1
longer?	1
Oh,	1
these	1
insufferable	1
streets,	1
shops,	1
bakers'	1
signboards,	1
street	1
lamps,	1
and	1
sleighs!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
when	1
their	1
leave	1
permits	1
had	1
been	1
passed	1
at	1
the	1
town	1
gate	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"Denisov!	1
We're	1
here!	1
He's	1
asleep,"	1
he	1
added,	1
leaning	1
forward	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
that	1
position	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
hasten	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
sleigh.	1
	1
Denisov	1
gave	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
"There's	1
the	1
corner	1
at	1
the	1
crossroads,	1
where	1
the	1
cabman,	1
Zakhar,	1
has	1
his	1
stand,	1
and	1
there's	1
Zakhar	1
himself	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
horse!	1
And	1
here's	1
the	1
little	1
shop	1
where	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
buy	1
gingerbread!	1
Can't	1
you	1
hurry	1
up?	1
Now	1
then!"	1
	1
"Which	1
house	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
the	1
driver.	1
	1
"Why,	1
that	1
one,	1
right	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
big	1
one.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see?	1
That's	1
our	1
house,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"Of	1
course,	1
it's	1
our	1
house!	1
Denisov,	1
Denisov!	1
We're	1
almost	1
there!"	1
	1
Denisov	1
raised	1
his	1
head,	1
coughed,	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
"Dmitri,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
to	1
his	1
valet	1
on	1
the	1
box,	1
"those	1
lights	1
are	1
in	1
our	1
house,	1
aren't	1
they?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
and	1
there's	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
your	1
father's	1
study."	1
	1
"Then	1
they've	1
not	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
yet?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
Mind	1
now,	1
don't	1
forget	1
to	1
put	1
out	1
my	1
new	1
coat,"	1
added	1
Rostov,	1
fingering	1
his	1
new	1
mustache.	1
"Now	1
then,	1
get	1
on,"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
driver.	1
"Do	1
wake	1
up,	1
Vaska!"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Denisov,	1
whose	1
head	1
was	1
again	1
nodding.	1
"Come,	1
get	1
on!	1
You	1
shall	1
have	1
three	1
rubles	1
for	1
vodka--get	1
on!"	1
Rostov	1
shouted,	1
when	1
the	1
sleigh	1
was	1
only	1
three	1
houses	1
from	1
his	1
door.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
not	1
moving	1
at	1
all.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
sleigh	1
bore	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
an	1
entrance,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
overhead	1
the	1
old	1
familiar	1
cornice	1
with	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
plaster	1
broken	1
off,	1
the	1
porch,	1
and	1
the	1
post	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pavement.	1
He	1
sprang	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
sleigh	1
stopped,	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
The	1
house	1
stood	1
cold	1
and	1
silent,	1
as	1
if	1
quite	1
regardless	1
of	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
it.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
hall.	1
"Oh	1
God!	1
Is	1
everyone	1
all	1
right?"	1
he	1
thought,	1
stopping	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart,	1
and	1
then	1
immediately	1
starting	1
to	1
run	1
along	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
up	1
the	1
warped	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
familiar	1
staircase.	1
The	1
well-known	1
old	1
door	1
handle,	1
which	1
always	1
angered	1
the	1
countess	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
properly	1
cleaned,	1
turned	1
as	1
loosely	1
as	1
ever.	1
A	1
solitary	1
tallow	1
candle	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
	1
Old	1
Michael	1
was	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
chest.	1
Prokofy,	1
the	1
footman,	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
lift	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
from	1
behind,	1
sat	1
plaiting	1
slippers	1
out	1
of	1
cloth	1
selvedges.	1
He	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
opening	1
door	1
and	1
his	1
expression	1
of	1
sleepy	1
indifference	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
delighted	1
amazement.	1
	1
"Gracious	1
heavens!	1
The	1
young	1
count!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
recognizing	1
his	1
young	1
master.	1
"Can	1
it	1
be?	1
My	1
treasure!"	1
and	1
Prokofy,	1
trembling	1
with	1
excitement,	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door,	1
probably	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
announce	1
him,	1
but,	1
changing	1
his	1
mind,	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
stooped	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"All	1
well?"	1
asked	1
Rostov,	1
drawing	1
away	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
God	1
be	1
thanked!	1
Yes!	1
They've	1
just	1
finished	1
supper.	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
you,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"Is	1
everything	1
quite	1
all	1
right?"	1
	1
"The	1
Lord	1
be	1
thanked,	1
yes!"	1
	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
Denisov,	1
not	1
wishing	1
anyone	1
to	1
forestall	1
him,	1
threw	1
off	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
and	1
ran	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
through	1
the	1
large	1
dark	1
ballroom.	1
All	1
was	1
the	1
same:	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
card	1
tables	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
chandelier	1
with	1
a	1
cover	1
over	1
it;	1
but	1
someone	1
had	1
already	1
seen	1
the	1
young	1
master,	1
and,	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
something	1
flew	1
out	1
from	1
a	1
side	1
door	1
like	1
a	1
tornado	1
and	1
began	1
hugging	1
and	1
kissing	1
him.	1
Another	1
and	1
yet	1
another	1
creature	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
sprang	1
from	1
a	1
second	1
door	1
and	1
a	1
third;	1
more	1
hugging,	1
more	1
kissing,	1
more	1
outcries,	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
joy.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
which	1
was	1
Papa,	1
which	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
which	1
Petya.	1
Everyone	1
shouted,	1
talked,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
Only	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
he	1
noticed	1
that.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know...	1
Nicholas...	1
My	1
darling!..."	1
	1
"Here	1
he	1
is...	1
our	1
own...	1
Kolya,	1
*	1
dear	1
fellow...	1
How	1
he	1
has	1
changed!...	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
candles?...	1
Tea!..."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"And	1
me,	1
kiss	1
me!"	1
	1
"Dearest...	1
and	1
me!"	1
	1
Sonya,	1
Natasha,	1
Petya,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
Vera,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
were	1
all	1
hugging	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
serfs,	1
men	1
and	1
maids,	1
flocked	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
exclaiming	1
and	1
oh-ing	1
and	1
ah-ing.	1
	1
Petya,	1
clinging	1
to	1
his	1
legs,	1
kept	1
shouting,	1
"And	1
me	1
too!"	1
	1
Natasha,	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
pulled	1
him	1
down	1
toward	1
her	1
and	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
kisses,	1
holding	1
him	1
tight	1
by	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
coat,	1
sprang	1
away	1
and	1
pranced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
like	1
a	1
goat	1
and	1
shrieked	1
piercingly.	1
	1
All	1
around	1
were	1
loving	1
eyes	1
glistening	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
joy,	1
and	1
all	1
around	1
were	1
lips	1
seeking	1
a	1
kiss.	1
	1
Sonya	1
too,	1
all	1
rosy	1
red,	1
clung	1
to	1
his	1
arm	1
and,	1
radiant	1
with	1
bliss,	1
looked	1
eagerly	1
toward	1
his	1
eyes,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
look	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
longed.	1
Sonya	1
now	1
was	1
sixteen	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
pretty,	1
especially	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
of	1
happy,	1
rapturous	1
excitement.	1
She	1
gazed	1
at	1
him,	1
not	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
him,	1
and	1
smiling	1
and	1
holding	1
her	1
breath.	1
He	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
grateful	1
look,	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
expectant	1
and	1
looking	1
for	1
someone.	1
The	1
old	1
countess	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
But	1
now	1
steps	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
steps	1
so	1
rapid	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
his	1
mother's.	1
	1
Yet	1
it	1
was	1
she,	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
gown	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
made	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
left.	1
All	1
the	1
others	1
let	1
him	1
go,	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
her.	1
When	1
they	1
met,	1
she	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
sobbing.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
lift	1
her	1
face,	1
but	1
only	1
pressed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
cold	1
braiding	1
of	1
his	1
hussar's	1
jacket.	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
unnoticed	1
by	1
anyone,	1
stood	1
there	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
sight.	1
	1
"Vasili	1
Denisov,	1
your	1
son's	1
friend,"	1
he	1
said,	1
introducing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
was	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
most	1
welcome!	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
kissing	1
and	1
embracing	1
Denisov.	1
"Nicholas	1
wrote	1
us...	1
Natasha,	1
Vera,	1
look!	1
Here	1
is	1
Denisov!"	1
	1
The	1
same	1
happy,	1
rapturous	1
faces	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
shaggy	1
figure	1
of	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Darling	1
Denisov!"	1
screamed	1
Natasha,	1
beside	1
herself	1
with	1
rapture,	1
springing	1
to	1
him,	1
putting	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
kissing	1
him.	1
This	1
escapade	1
made	1
everybody	1
feel	1
confused.	1
Denisov	1
blushed	1
too,	1
but	1
smiled	1
and,	1
taking	1
Natasha's	1
hand,	1
kissed	1
it.	1
	1
Denisov	1
was	1
shown	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
prepared	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
all	1
gathered	1
round	1
Nicholas	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
countess,	1
not	1
letting	1
go	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
kissing	1
it	1
every	1
moment,	1
sat	1
beside	1
him:	1
the	1
rest,	1
crowding	1
round	1
him,	1
watched	1
every	1
movement,	1
word,	1
or	1
look	1
of	1
his,	1
never	1
taking	1
their	1
blissfully	1
adoring	1
eyes	1
off	1
him.	1
His	1
brother	1
and	1
sisters	1
struggled	1
for	1
the	1
places	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
disputed	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
who	1
should	1
bring	1
him	1
his	1
tea,	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
pipe.	1
	1
Rostov	1
was	1
very	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
they	1
showed	1
him;	1
but	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
meeting	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
beatific	1
that	1
his	1
present	1
joy	1
seemed	1
insufficient,	1
and	1
he	1
kept	1
expecting	1
something	1
more,	1
more	1
and	1
yet	1
more.	1
	1
Next	1
morning,	1
after	1
the	1
fatigues	1
of	1
their	1
journey,	1
the	1
travelers	1
slept	1
till	1
ten	1
o'clock.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
room	1
next	1
their	1
bedroom	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
confusion	1
of	1
sabers,	1
satchels,	1
sabretaches,	1
open	1
portmanteaus,	1
and	1
dirty	1
boots.	1
Two	1
freshly	1
cleaned	1
pairs	1
with	1
spurs	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
placed	1
by	1
the	1
wall.	1
The	1
servants	1
were	1
bringing	1
in	1
jugs	1
and	1
basins,	1
hot	1
water	1
for	1
shaving,	1
and	1
their	1
well-	1
brushed	1
clothes.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
masculine	1
odor	1
and	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
tobacco.	1
	1
"Hallo,	1
Gwiska--my	1
pipe!"	1
came	1
Vasili	1
Denisov's	1
husky	1
voice.	1
"Wostov,	1
get	1
up!"	1
	1
Rostov,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
glued	1
together,	1
raised	1
his	1
disheveled	1
head	1
from	1
the	1
hot	1
pillow.	1
	1
"Why,	1
is	1
it	1
late?"	1
	1
"Late!	1
It's	1
nearly	1
ten	1
o'clock,"	1
answered	1
Natasha's	1
voice.	1
A	1
rustle	1
of	1
starched	1
petticoats	1
and	1
the	1
whispering	1
and	1
laughter	1
of	1
girls'	1
voices	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
adjoining	1
room.	1
The	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
a	1
crack	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
something	1
blue,	1
of	1
ribbons,	1
black	1
hair,	1
and	1
merry	1
faces.	1
It	1
was	1
Natasha,	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
Petya,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
getting	1
up.	1
	1
"Nicholas!	1
Get	1
up!"	1
Natasha's	1
voice	1
was	1
again	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Directly!"	1
	1
Meanwhile,	1
Petya,	1
having	1
found	1
and	1
seized	1
the	1
sabers	1
in	1
the	1
outer	1
room,	1
with	1
the	1
delight	1
boys	1
feel	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
military	1
elder	1
brother,	1
and	1
forgetting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
unbecoming	1
for	1
the	1
girls	1
to	1
see	1
men	1
undressed,	1
opened	1
the	1
bedroom	1
door.	1
	1
"Is	1
this	1
your	1
saber?"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
The	1
girls	1
sprang	1
aside.	1
Denisov	1
hid	1
his	1
hairy	1
legs	1
under	1
the	1
blanket,	1
looking	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
face	1
at	1
his	1
comrade	1
for	1
help.	1
The	1
door,	1
having	1
let	1
Petya	1
in,	1
closed	1
again.	1
A	1
sound	1
of	1
laughter	1
came	1
from	1
behind	1
it.	1
	1
"Nicholas!	1
Come	1
out	1
in	1
your	1
dressing	1
gown!"	1
said	1
Natasha's	1
voice.	1
	1
"Is	1
this	1
your	1
saber?"	1
asked	1
Petya.	1
"Or	1
is	1
it	1
yours?"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
the	1
black-mustached	1
Denisov	1
with	1
servile	1
deference.	1
	1
Rostov	1
hurriedly	1
put	1
something	1
on	1
his	1
feet,	1
drew	1
on	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
Natasha	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
one	1
spurred	1
boot	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
getting	1
her	1
foot	1
into	1
the	1
other.	1
Sonya,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in,	1
was	1
twirling	1
round	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
expand	1
her	1
dresses	1
into	1
a	1
balloon	1
and	1
sit	1
down.	1
They	1
were	1
dressed	1
alike,	1
in	1
new	1
pale-blue	1
frocks,	1
and	1
were	1
both	1
fresh,	1
rosy,	1
and	1
bright.	1
Sonya	1
ran	1
away,	1
but	1
Natasha,	1
taking	1
her	1
brother's	1
arm,	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
where	1
they	1
began	1
talking.	1
They	1
hardly	1
gave	1
one	1
another	1
time	1
to	1
ask	1
questions	1
and	1
give	1
replies	1
concerning	1
a	1
thousand	1
little	1
matters	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
interest	1
anyone	1
but	1
themselves.	1
Natasha	1
laughed	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
said	1
or	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
herself,	1
not	1
because	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
was	1
amusing,	1
but	1
because	1
she	1
felt	1
happy	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
control	1
her	1
joy	1
which	1
expressed	1
itself	1
by	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
nice,	1
how	1
splendid!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
everything.	1
	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
that,	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
warm	1
rays	1
of	1
love,	1
that	1
childlike	1
smile	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
since	1
he	1
left	1
home	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
after	1
eighteen	1
months	1
again	1
brightened	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
listen,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"now	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
a	1
man,	1
aren't	1
you?	1
I'm	1
awfully	1
glad	1
you're	1
my	1
brother."	1
She	1
touched	1
his	1
mustache.	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
men	1
are	1
like.	1
Are	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
we?	1
No?"	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
Sonya	1
run	1
away?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes!	1
That's	1
a	1
whole	1
long	1
story!	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her--	1
thou	1
or	1
you?"	1
	1
"As	1
may	1
happen,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"No,	1
call	1
her	1
you,	1
please!	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
some	1
other	1
time.	1
No,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
now.	1
You	1
know	1
Sonya's	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend.	1
Such	1
a	1
friend	1
that	1
I	1
burned	1
my	1
arm	1
for	1
her	1
sake.	1
Look	1
here!"	1
	1
She	1
pulled	1
up	1
her	1
muslin	1
sleeve	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
a	1
red	1
scar	1
on	1
her	1
long,	1
slender,	1
delicate	1
arm,	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
elbow	1
on	1
that	1
part	1
that	1
is	1
covered	1
even	1
by	1
a	1
ball	1
dress.	1
	1
"I	1
burned	1
this	1
to	1
prove	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
her.	1
I	1
just	1
heated	1
a	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
pressed	1
it	1
there!"	1
	1
Sitting	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
cushions	1
on	1
its	1
arms,	1
in	1
what	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
old	1
schoolroom,	1
and	1
looking	1
into	1
Natasha's	1
wildly	1
bright	1
eyes,	1
Rostov	1
re-entered	1
that	1
world	1
of	1
home	1
and	1
childhood	1
which	1
had	1
no	1
meaning	1
for	1
anyone	1
else,	1
but	1
gave	1
him	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
joys	1
of	1
his	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
an	1
arm	1
with	1
a	1
ruler	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
love	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
senseless,	1
he	1
understood	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
at	1
it.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
is	1
that	1
all?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
such	1
friends,	1
such	1
friends!	1
All	1
that	1
ruler	1
business	1
was	1
just	1
nonsense,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
friends	1
forever.	1
She,	1
if	1
she	1
loves	1
anyone,	1
does	1
it	1
for	1
life,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
that,	1
I	1
forget	1
quickly."	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
she	1
loves	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
flushed.	1
	1
"Why,	1
you	1
remember	1
before	1
you	1
went	1
away?...	1
Well,	1
she	1
says	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
forget	1
all	1
that....	1
She	1
says:	1
'I	1
shall	1
love	1
him	1
always,	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
free.'	1
Isn't	1
that	1
lovely	1
and	1
noble!	1
Yes,	1
very	1
noble?	1
Isn't	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Natasha,	1
so	1
seriously	1
and	1
excitedly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
saying	1
she	1
had	1
talked	1
of	1
before,	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
Rostov	1
became	1
thoughtful.	1
	1
"I	1
never	1
go	1
back	1
on	1
my	1
word,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Besides,	1
Sonya	1
is	1
so	1
charming	1
that	1
only	1
a	1
fool	1
would	1
renounce	1
such	1
happiness."	1
	1
"No,	1
no!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
"she	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
talked	1
it	1
over.	1
We	1
knew	1
you'd	1
say	1
so.	1
But	1
it	1
won't	1
do,	1
because	1
you	1
see,	1
if	1
you	1
say	1
that--if	1
you	1
consider	1
yourself	1
bound	1
by	1
your	1
promise--it	1
will	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
meant	1
it	1
seriously.	1
It	1
makes	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
marrying	1
her	1
because	1
you	1
must,	1
and	1
that	1
wouldn't	1
do	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
well	1
considered	1
by	1
them.	1
Sonya	1
had	1
already	1
struck	1
him	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
on	1
the	1
preceding	1
day.	1
Today,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
her,	1
she	1
seemed	1
still	1
more	1
lovely.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
charming	1
girl	1
of	1
sixteen,	1
evidently	1
passionately	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
(he	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
instant).	1
Why	1
should	1
he	1
not	1
love	1
her	1
now,	1
and	1
even	1
marry	1
her,	1
Rostov	1
thought,	1
but	1
just	1
now	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
other	1
pleasures	1
and	1
interests	1
before	1
him!	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
a	1
wise	1
decision,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"I	1
must	1
remain	1
free."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
that's	1
excellent,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"We'll	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
later	1
on.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
have	1
you!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
are	1
you	1
still	1
true	1
to	1
Boris?"	1
he	1
continued.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
nonsense!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
laughing.	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
about	1
him	1
or	1
anyone	1
else,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind."	1
	1
"Dear	1
me!	1
Then	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
now?"	1
	1
"Now?"	1
repeated	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
a	1
happy	1
smile	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
face.	1
"Have	1
you	1
seen	1
Duport?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"Not	1
seen	1
Duport--the	1
famous	1
dancer?	1
Well	1
then,	1
you	1
won't	1
understand.	1
That's	1
what	1
I'm	1
up	1
to."	1
	1
Curving	1
her	1
arms,	1
Natasha	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
skirts	1
as	1
dancers	1
do,	1
ran	1
back	1
a	1
few	1
steps,	1
turned,	1
cut	1
a	1
caper,	1
brought	1
her	1
little	1
feet	1
sharply	1
together,	1
and	1
made	1
some	1
steps	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
tips	1
of	1
her	1
toes.	1
	1
"See,	1
I'm	1
standing!	1
See!"	1
she	1
said,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
maintain	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
toes	1
any	1
longer.	1
"So	1
that's	1
what	1
I'm	1
up	1
to!	1
I'll	1
never	1
marry	1
anyone,	1
but	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
dancer.	1
Only	1
don't	1
tell	1
anyone."	1
	1
Rostov	1
laughed	1
so	1
loud	1
and	1
merrily	1
that	1
Denisov,	1
in	1
his	1
bedroom,	1
felt	1
envious	1
and	1
Natasha	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
joining	1
in.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
don't	1
you	1
think	1
it's	1
nice?"	1
she	1
kept	1
repeating.	1
	1
"Nice!	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
no	1
longer	1
wish	1
to	1
marry	1
Boris?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
flared	1
up.	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
marry	1
anyone.	1
And	1
I'll	1
tell	1
him	1
so	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
him!"	1
	1
"Dear	1
me!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
all	1
rubbish,"	1
Natasha	1
chattered	1
on.	1
"And	1
is	1
Denisov	1
nice?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
indeed!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
well	1
then,	1
good-by:	1
go	1
and	1
dress.	1
Is	1
he	1
very	1
terrible,	1
Denisov?"	1
	1
"Why	1
terrible?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas.	1
"No,	1
Vaska	1
is	1
a	1
splendid	1
fellow."	1
	1
"You	1
call	1
him	1
Vaska?	1
That's	1
funny!	1
And	1
is	1
he	1
very	1
nice?"	1
	1
"Very."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
be	1
quick.	1
We'll	1
all	1
have	1
breakfast	1
together."	1
	1
And	1
Natasha	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
on	1
tiptoe,	1
like	1
a	1
ballet	1
dancer,	1
but	1
smiling	1
as	1
only	1
happy	1
girls	1
of	1
fifteen	1
can	1
smile.	1
When	1
Rostov	1
met	1
Sonya	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
he	1
reddened.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave	1
with	1
her.	1
The	1
evening	1
before,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
happy	1
moment	1
of	1
meeting,	1
they	1
had	1
kissed	1
each	1
other,	1
but	1
today	1
they	1
felt	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done;	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
everybody,	1
including	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters,	1
was	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
watching	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
behave	1
with	1
her.	1
He	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
addressed	1
her	1
not	1
as	1
thou	1
but	1
as	1
you--Sonya.	1
But	1
their	1
eyes	1
met	1
and	1
said	1
thou,	1
and	1
exchanged	1
tender	1
kisses.	1
Her	1
looks	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
for	1
having	1
dared,	1
by	1
Natasha's	1
intermediacy,	1
to	1
remind	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
promise,	1
and	1
then	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
love.	1
His	1
looks	1
thanked	1
her	1
for	1
offering	1
him	1
his	1
freedom	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
her,	1
for	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
impossible.	1
	1
"How	1
strange	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
Vera,	1
selecting	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
all	1
were	1
silent,	1
"that	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
now	1
say	1
you	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
meet	1
like	1
strangers."	1
	1
Vera's	1
remark	1
was	1
correct,	1
as	1
her	1
remarks	1
always	1
were,	1
but,	1
like	1
most	1
of	1
her	1
observations,	1
it	1
made	1
everyone	1
feel	1
uncomfortable,	1
not	1
only	1
Sonya,	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
old	1
countess,	1
who--dreading	1
this	1
love	1
affair	1
which	1
might	1
hinder	1
Nicholas	1
from	1
making	1
a	1
brilliant	1
match--	1
blushed	1
like	1
a	1
girl.	1
	1
Denisov,	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
surprise,	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
pomaded	1
hair,	1
perfumed,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
uniform,	1
looking	1
just	1
as	1
smart	1
as	1
he	1
made	1
himself	1
when	1
going	1
into	1
battle,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
amiable	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
than	1
Rostov	1
had	1
ever	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
On	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Moscow	1
from	1
the	1
army,	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
was	1
welcomed	1
by	1
his	1
home	1
circle	1
as	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
sons,	1
a	1
hero,	1
and	1
their	1
darling	1
Nikolenka;	1
by	1
his	1
relations	1
as	1
a	1
charming,	1
attractive,	1
and	1
polite	1
young	1
man;	1
by	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
as	1
a	1
handsome	1
lieutenant	1
of	1
hussars,	1
a	1
good	1
dancer,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
matches	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
The	1
Rostovs	1
knew	1
everybody	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
had	1
money	1
enough	1
that	1
year,	1
as	1
all	1
his	1
estates	1
had	1
been	1
remortgaged,	1
and	1
so	1
Nicholas,	1
acquiring	1
a	1
trotter	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
very	1
stylish	1
riding	1
breeches	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
cut,	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
yet	1
had	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
boots	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion,	1
with	1
extremely	1
pointed	1
toes	1
and	1
small	1
silver	1
spurs,	1
passed	1
his	1
time	1
very	1
gaily.	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
period	1
of	1
adapting	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
conditions	1
of	1
life,	1
Nicholas	1
found	1
it	1
very	1
pleasant	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
again.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
and	1
matured	1
very	1
much.	1
His	1
despair	1
at	1
failing	1
in	1
a	1
Scripture	1
examination,	1
his	1
borrowing	1
money	1
from	1
Gavril	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
sleigh	1
driver,	1
his	1
kissing	1
Sonya	1
on	1
the	1
sly--he	1
now	1
recalled	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
childishness	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
immeasurably	1
behind.	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
lieutenant	1
of	1
hussars,	1
in	1
a	1
jacket	1
laced	1
with	1
silver,	1
and	1
wearing	1
the	1
Cross	1
of	1
St.	1
George,	1
awarded	1
to	1
soldiers	1
for	1
bravery	1
in	1
action,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
well-known,	1
elderly,	1
and	1
respected	1
racing	1
men	1
was	1
training	1
a	1
trotter	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
for	1
a	1
race.	1
He	1
knew	1
a	1
lady	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
boulevards	1
whom	1
he	1
visited	1
of	1
an	1
evening.	1
He	1
led	1
the	1
mazurka	1
at	1
the	1
Arkharovs'	1
ball,	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Field	1
Marshal	1
Kamenski,	1
visited	1
the	1
English	1
Club,	1
and	1
was	1
on	1
intimate	1
terms	1
with	1
a	1
colonel	1
of	1
forty	1
to	1
whom	1
Denisov	1
had	1
introduced	1
him.	1
	1
His	1
passion	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
cooled	1
somewhat	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
But	1
still,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity	1
of	1
seeing	1
him,	1
he	1
often	1
spoke	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
about	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
him,	1
letting	1
it	1
be	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
told	1
all	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
feelings	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
not	1
everyone	1
could	1
understand,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
he	1
shared	1
the	1
adoration	1
then	1
common	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
who	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
the	1
"angel	1
incarnate."	1
	1
During	1
Rostov's	1
short	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
before	1
rejoining	1
the	1
army,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
draw	1
closer	1
to	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
rather	1
drifted	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
sweet,	1
and	1
evidently	1
deeply	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
youth	1
when	1
there	1
seems	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
fears	1
to	1
bind	1
himself	1
and	1
prizes	1
his	1
freedom	1
which	1
he	1
needs	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
other	1
things.	1
When	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
during	1
this	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"Ah,	1
there	1
will	1
be,	1
and	1
there	1
are,	1
many	1
more	1
such	1
girls	1
somewhere	1
whom	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
yet	1
know.	1
There	1
will	1
be	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
love	1
when	1
I	1
want	1
to,	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
time."	1
Besides,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
women	1
was	1
rather	1
derogatory	1
to	1
his	1
manhood.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
balls	1
and	1
into	1
ladies'	1
society	1
with	1
an	1
affectation	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
against	1
his	1
will.	1
The	1
races,	1
the	1
English	1
Club,	1
sprees	1
with	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
visits	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
house--that	1
was	1
another	1
matter	1
and	1
quite	1
the	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
dashing	1
young	1
hussar!	1
	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
March,	1
old	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
was	1
very	1
busy	1
arranging	1
a	1
dinner	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
Club.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
hall	1
in	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
giving	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
steward	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
famous	1
Feoktist,	1
the	1
club's	1
head	1
cook,	1
about	1
asparagus,	1
fresh	1
cucumbers,	1
strawberries,	1
veal,	1
and	1
fish	1
for	1
this	1
dinner.	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
member	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
committee	1
of	1
the	1
club	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
it	1
was	1
founded.	1
To	1
him	1
the	1
club	1
entrusted	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
festival	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
Bagration,	1
for	1
few	1
men	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
feast	1
on	1
an	1
open-handed,	1
hospitable	1
scale,	1
and	1
still	1
fewer	1
men	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
well	1
able	1
and	1
willing	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
resources	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
fete.	1
The	1
club	1
cook	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
orders	1
with	1
pleased	1
faces,	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
under	1
no	1
other	1
management	1
could	1
they	1
so	1
easily	1
extract	1
a	1
good	1
profit	1
for	1
themselves	1
from	1
a	1
dinner	1
costing	1
several	1
thousand	1
rubles.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
mind	1
and	1
have	1
cocks'	1
comb	1
in	1
the	1
turtle	1
soup,	1
you	1
know!"	1
	1
"Shall	1
we	1
have	1
three	1
cold	1
dishes	1
then?"	1
asked	1
the	1
cook.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
considered.	1
	1
"We	1
can't	1
have	1
less--yes,	1
three...	1
the	1
mayonnaise,	1
that's	1
one,"	1
said	1
he,	1
bending	1
down	1
a	1
finger.	1
	1
"Then	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
order	1
those	1
large	1
sterlets?"	1
asked	1
the	1
steward.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped	1
if	1
they	1
won't	1
take	1
less.	1
Ah,	1
dear	1
me!	1
I	1
was	1
forgetting.	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
another	1
entree.	1
Ah,	1
goodness	1
gracious!"	1
he	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
head.	1
"Who	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
me	1
the	1
flowers?	1
Dmitri!	1
Eh,	1
Dmitri!	1
Gallop	1
off	1
to	1
our	1
Moscow	1
estate,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
factotum	1
who	1
appeared	1
at	1
his	1
call.	1
"Hurry	1
off	1
and	1
tell	1
Maksim,	1
the	1
gardener,	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
serfs	1
to	1
work.	1
Say	1
that	1
everything	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hothouses	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
here	1
well	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
felt.	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
two	1
hundred	1
pots	1
here	1
on	1
Friday."	1
	1
Having	1
given	1
several	1
more	1
orders,	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
"little	1
countess"	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
rest,	1
but	1
remembering	1
something	1
else	1
of	1
importance,	1
he	1
returned	1
again,	1
called	1
back	1
the	1
cook	1
and	1
the	1
club	1
steward,	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
giving	1
orders.	1
A	1
light	1
footstep	1
and	1
the	1
clinking	1
of	1
spurs	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
count,	1
handsome,	1
rosy,	1
with	1
a	1
dark	1
little	1
mustache,	1
evidently	1
rested	1
and	1
made	1
sleeker	1
by	1
his	1
easy	1
life	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
boy,	1
my	1
head's	1
in	1
a	1
whirl!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
confused	1
before	1
his	1
son.	1
"Now,	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
only	1
help	1
a	1
bit!	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
singers	1
too.	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
my	1
own	1
orchestra,	1
but	1
shouldn't	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
gypsy	1
singers	1
as	1
well?	1
You	1
military	1
men	1
like	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing."	1
	1
"Really,	1
Papa,	1
I	1
believe	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
worried	1
himself	1
less	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
than	1
you	1
do	1
now,"	1
said	1
his	1
son	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
angry.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
talk,	1
but	1
try	1
it	1
yourself!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
count	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
cook,	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
shrewd	1
and	1
respectful	1
expression,	1
looked	1
observantly	1
and	1
sympathetically	1
at	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
son.	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
come	1
to	1
nowadays,	1
eh,	1
Feoktist?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Laughing	1
at	1
us	1
old	1
fellows!"	1
	1
"That's	1
so,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
all	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
eat	1
a	1
good	1
dinner,	1
but	1
providing	1
it	1
and	1
serving	1
it	1
all	1
up,	1
that's	1
not	1
their	1
business!"	1
	1
"That's	1
it,	1
that's	1
it!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
gaily	1
seizing	1
his	1
son	1
by	1
both	1
hands,	1
he	1
cried,	1
"Now	1
I've	1
got	1
you,	1
so	1
take	1
the	1
sleigh	1
and	1
pair	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
Bezukhov's,	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
'Count	1
Ilya	1
has	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
strawberries	1
and	1
fresh	1
pineapples.'	1
We	1
can't	1
get	1
them	1
from	1
anyone	1
else.	1
He's	1
not	1
there	1
himself,	1
so	1
you'll	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
ask	1
the	1
princesses;	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
Rasgulyay--the	1
coachman	1
Ipatka	1
knows--and	1
look	1
up	1
the	1
gypsy	1
Ilyushka,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
danced	1
at	1
Count	1
Orlov's,	1
you	1
remember,	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
Cossack	1
coat,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
along	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"And	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
gypsy	1
girls	1
along	1
with	1
him?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas,	1
laughing.	1
"Dear,	1
dear!..."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
with	1
noiseless	1
footsteps	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
businesslike,	1
preoccupied,	1
yet	1
meekly	1
Christian	1
look	1
which	1
never	1
left	1
her	1
face,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
entered	1
the	1
hall.	1
Though	1
she	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
every	1
day,	1
he	1
invariably	1
became	1
confused	1
and	1
begged	1
her	1
to	1
excuse	1
his	1
costume.	1
	1
"No	1
matter	1
at	1
all,	1
my	1
dear	1
count,"	1
she	1
said,	1
meekly	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"But	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
Bezukhov's	1
myself.	1
Pierre	1
has	1
arrived,	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
shall	1
get	1
anything	1
we	1
want	1
from	1
his	1
hothouses.	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
any	1
case.	1
He	1
has	1
forwarded	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Boris.	1
Thank	1
God,	1
Boris	1
is	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
staff."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
delighted	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
taking	1
upon	1
herself	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
commissions	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
small	1
closed	1
carriage	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"Tell	1
Bezukhov	1
to	1
come.	1
I'll	1
put	1
his	1
name	1
down.	1
Is	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
him?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
turned	1
up	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
profound	1
sadness	1
was	1
depicted	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
unfortunate,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"If	1
what	1
we	1
hear	1
is	1
true,	1
it	1
is	1
dreadful.	1
How	1
little	1
we	1
dreamed	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
his	1
happiness!	1
And	1
such	1
a	1
lofty	1
angelic	1
soul	1
as	1
young	1
Bezukhov!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
pity	1
him	1
from	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
what	1
consolation	1
I	1
can."	1
	1
"Wh-what	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
asked	1
both	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
sighed	1
deeply.	1
	1
"Dolokhov,	1
Mary	1
Ivanovna's	1
son,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
mysterious	1
whisper,	1
"has	1
compromised	1
her	1
completely,	1
they	1
say.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
now...	1
she	1
has	1
come	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
daredevil	1
after	1
her!"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
sympathy	1
for	1
Pierre,	1
but	1
by	1
involuntary	1
intonations	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
smile	1
betraying	1
her	1
sympathy	1
for	1
the	1
"daredevil,"	1
as	1
she	1
called	1
Dolokhov.	1
"They	1
say	1
Pierre	1
is	1
quite	1
broken	1
by	1
his	1
misfortune."	1
	1
"Dear,	1
dear!	1
But	1
still	1
tell	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
club--it	1
will	1
all	1
blow	1
over.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
tremendous	1
banquet."	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
the	1
third	1
of	1
March,	1
soon	1
after	1
one	1
o'clock,	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
and	1
fifty	1
guests	1
were	1
awaiting	1
the	1
guest	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
hero	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
campaign,	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
first	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
bewildered.	1
At	1
that	1
time,	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
victories	1
that	1
on	1
receiving	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
defeat	1
some	1
would	1
simply	1
not	1
believe	1
it,	1
while	1
others	1
sought	1
some	1
extraordinary	1
explanation	1
of	1
so	1
strange	1
an	1
event.	1
In	1
the	1
English	1
Club,	1
where	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
distinguished,	1
important,	1
and	1
well	1
informed	1
foregathered	1
when	1
the	1
news	1
began	1
to	1
arrive	1
in	1
December,	1
nothing	1
was	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
battle,	1
as	1
though	1
all	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
of	1
silence.	1
The	1
men	1
who	1
set	1
the	1
tone	1
in	1
conversation--Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
Prince	1
Yuri	1
Dolgorukov,	1
Valuev,	1
Count	1
Markov,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vyazemski--did	1
not	1
show	1
themselves	1
at	1
the	1
club,	1
but	1
met	1
in	1
private	1
houses	1
in	1
intimate	1
circles,	1
and	1
the	1
Moscovites	1
who	1
took	1
their	1
opinions	1
from	1
others--Ilya	1
Rostov	1
among	1
them--remained	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
without	1
any	1
definite	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
without	1
leaders.	1
The	1
Moscovites	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
bad	1
news	1
was	1
difficult,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
best	1
to	1
be	1
silent.	1
But	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
jury	1
comes	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
room,	1
the	1
bigwigs	1
who	1
guided	1
the	1
club's	1
opinion	1
reappeared,	1
and	1
everybody	1
began	1
speaking	1
clearly	1
and	1
definitely.	1
Reasons	1
were	1
found	1
for	1
the	1
incredible,	1
unheard-	1
of,	1
and	1
impossible	1
event	1
of	1
a	1
Russian	1
defeat,	1
everything	1
became	1
clear,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
corners	1
of	1
Moscow	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
said.	1
These	1
reasons	1
were	1
the	1
treachery	1
of	1
the	1
Austrians,	1
a	1
defective	1
commissariat,	1
the	1
treachery	1
of	1
the	1
Pole	1
Przebyszewski	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
Langeron,	1
Kutuzov's	1
incapacity,	1
and	1
(it	1
was	1
whispered)	1
the	1
youth	1
and	1
inexperience	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
who	1
had	1
trusted	1
worthless	1
and	1
insignificant	1
people.	1
But	1
the	1
army,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
everyone	1
declared,	1
was	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
had	1
achieved	1
miracles	1
of	1
valor.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
officers,	1
and	1
generals	1
were	1
heroes.	1
But	1
the	1
hero	1
of	1
heroes	1
was	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
affair	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
retreat	1
from	1
Austerlitz,	1
where	1
he	1
alone	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
his	1
column	1
unbroken	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
day	1
beaten	1
back	1
an	1
enemy	1
force	1
twice	1
as	1
numerous	1
as	1
his	1
own.	1
What	1
also	1
conduced	1
to	1
Bagration's	1
being	1
selected	1
as	1
Moscow's	1
hero	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
connections	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
stranger	1
there.	1
In	1
his	1
person,	1
honor	1
was	1
shown	1
to	1
a	1
simple	1
fighting	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
without	1
connections	1
and	1
intrigues,	1
and	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
associated	1
by	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
Italian	1
campaign	1
with	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Suvorov.	1
Moreover,	1
paying	1
such	1
honor	1
to	1
Bagration	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
of	1
expressing	1
disapproval	1
and	1
dislike	1
of	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"Had	1
there	1
been	1
no	1
Bagration,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
necessary	1
to	1
invent	1
him,"	1
said	1
the	1
wit	1
Shinshin,	1
parodying	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Voltaire.	1
Kutuzov	1
no	1
one	1
spoke	1
of,	1
except	1
some	1
who	1
abused	1
him	1
in	1
whispers,	1
calling	1
him	1
a	1
court	1
weathercock	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
satyr.	1
	1
All	1
Moscow	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov's	1
saying:	1
"If	1
you	1
go	1
on	1
modeling	1
and	1
modeling	1
you	1
must	1
get	1
smeared	1
with	1
clay,"	1
suggesting	1
consolation	1
for	1
our	1
defeat	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
former	1
victories;	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rostopchin,	1
that	1
French	1
soldiers	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
incited	1
to	1
battle	1
by	1
highfalutin	1
words,	1
and	1
Germans	1
by	1
logical	1
arguments	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
dangerous	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
than	1
to	1
advance,	1
but	1
that	1
Russian	1
soldiers	1
only	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
restrained	1
and	1
held	1
back!	1
On	1
all	1
sides,	1
new	1
and	1
fresh	1
anecdotes	1
were	1
heard	1
of	1
individual	1
examples	1
of	1
heroism	1
shown	1
by	1
our	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
at	1
Austerlitz.	1
One	1
had	1
saved	1
a	1
standard,	1
another	1
had	1
killed	1
five	1
Frenchmen,	1
a	1
third	1
had	1
loaded	1
five	1
cannon	1
singlehanded.	1
Berg	1
was	1
mentioned,	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him,	1
as	1
having,	1
when	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
taken	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
gone	1
forward.	1
Of	1
Bolkonski,	1
nothing	1
was	1
said,	1
and	1
only	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
intimately	1
regretted	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
died	1
so	1
young,	1
leaving	1
a	1
pregnant	1
wife	1
with	1
his	1
eccentric	1
father.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
On	1
that	1
third	1
of	1
March,	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
a	1
hum	1
of	1
conversation,	1
like	1
the	1
hum	1
of	1
bees	1
swarming	1
in	1
springtime.	1
The	1
members	1
and	1
guests	1
of	1
the	1
club	1
wandered	1
hither	1
and	1
thither,	1
sat,	1
stood,	1
met,	1
and	1
separated,	1
some	1
in	1
uniform	1
and	1
some	1
in	1
evening	1
dress,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
with	1
powdered	1
hair	1
and	1
in	1
Russian	1
kaftans.	1
Powdered	1
footmen,	1
in	1
livery	1
with	1
buckled	1
shoes	1
and	1
smart	1
stockings,	1
stood	1
at	1
every	1
door	1
anxiously	1
noting	1
visitors'	1
every	1
movement	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
offer	1
their	1
services.	1
Most	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
were	1
elderly,	1
respected	1
men	1
with	1
broad,	1
self-confident	1
faces,	1
fat	1
fingers,	1
and	1
resolute	1
gestures	1
and	1
voices.	1
This	1
class	1
of	1
guests	1
and	1
members	1
sat	1
in	1
certain	1
habitual	1
places	1
and	1
met	1
in	1
certain	1
habitual	1
groups.	1
A	1
minority	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
were	1
casual	1
guests--chiefly	1
young	1
men,	1
among	1
whom	1
were	1
Denisov,	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
Dolokhov--who	1
was	1
now	1
again	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment.	1
The	1
faces	1
of	1
these	1
young	1
people,	1
especially	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
military	1
men,	1
bore	1
that	1
expression	1
of	1
condescending	1
respect	1
for	1
their	1
elders	1
which	1
seems	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
older	1
generation,	1
"We	1
are	1
prepared	1
to	1
respect	1
and	1
honor	1
you,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
future	1
belongs	1
to	1
us."	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
was	1
there	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
club.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
at	1
his	1
wife's	1
command	1
had	1
let	1
his	1
hair	1
grow	1
and	1
abandoned	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
went	1
about	1
the	1
rooms	1
fashionably	1
dressed	1
but	1
looking	1
sad	1
and	1
dull.	1
Here,	1
as	1
elsewhere,	1
he	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
subservience	1
to	1
his	1
wealth,	1
and	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
lording	1
it	1
over	1
these	1
people,	1
he	1
treated	1
them	1
with	1
absent-minded	1
contempt.	1
	1
By	1
his	1
age	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
younger	1
men,	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
connections	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
groups	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
honored	1
guests,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
from	1
one	1
group	1
to	1
another.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
old	1
men	1
were	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
groups	1
which	1
even	1
strangers	1
approached	1
respectfully	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
well-known	1
men.	1
The	1
largest	1
circles	1
formed	1
round	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
Valuev,	1
and	1
Naryshkin.	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
describing	1
how	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
been	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
flying	1
Austrians	1
and	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
force	1
their	1
way	1
through	1
them	1
with	1
bayonets.	1
	1
Valuev	1
was	1
confidentially	1
telling	1
that	1
Uvarov	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
ascertain	1
what	1
Moscow	1
was	1
thinking	1
about	1
Austerlitz.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
circle,	1
Naryshkin	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
Council	1
of	1
War	1
at	1
which	1
Suvorov	1
crowed	1
like	1
a	1
cock	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
nonsense	1
talked	1
by	1
the	1
Austrian	1
generals.	1
Shinshin,	1
standing	1
close	1
by,	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
joke,	1
saying	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
evidently	1
failed	1
to	1
learn	1
from	1
Suvorov	1
even	1
so	1
simple	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
crowing	1
like	1
a	1
cock,	1
but	1
the	1
elder	1
members	1
glanced	1
severely	1
at	1
the	1
wit,	1
making	1
him	1
feel	1
that	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
it	1
was	1
improper	1
to	1
speak	1
so	1
of	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
hurried	1
and	1
preoccupied,	1
went	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
soft	1
boots	1
between	1
the	1
dining	1
and	1
drawing	1
rooms,	1
hastily	1
greeting	1
the	1
important	1
and	1
unimportant,	1
all	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
knew,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
equals,	1
while	1
his	1
eyes	1
occasionally	1
sought	1
out	1
his	1
fine	1
well-set-up	1
young	1
son,	1
resting	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
winking	1
joyfully	1
at	1
him.	1
Young	1
Rostov	1
stood	1
at	1
a	1
window	1
with	1
Dolokhov,	1
whose	1
acquaintance	1
he	1
had	1
lately	1
made	1
and	1
highly	1
valued.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
pressed	1
Dolokhov's	1
hand.	1
	1
"Please	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
us...	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
brave	1
boy...	1
been	1
together	1
out	1
there...	1
both	1
playing	1
the	1
hero...	1
Ah,	1
Vasili	1
Ignatovich...	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do,	1
old	1
fellow?"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
passing,	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
greeting	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
stir,	1
and	1
a	1
footman	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
in	1
announced,	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
face:	1
"He's	1
arrived!"	1
	1
Bells	1
rang,	1
the	1
stewards	1
rushed	1
forward,	1
and--like	1
rye	1
shaken	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
shovel--the	1
guests	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
scattered	1
about	1
in	1
different	1
rooms	1
came	1
together	1
and	1
crowded	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
drawing	1
room	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
	1
Bagration	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
of	1
the	1
anteroom	1
without	1
hat	1
or	1
sword,	1
which,	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
club	1
custom,	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
porter.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
lambskin	1
cap	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
nor	1
had	1
he	1
a	1
loaded	1
whip	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
as	1
when	1
Rostov	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
but	1
wore	1
a	1
tight	1
new	1
uniform	1
with	1
Russian	1
and	1
foreign	1
Orders,	1
and	1
the	1
Star	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
breast.	1
Evidently	1
just	1
before	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
dinner	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
whiskers	1
trimmed,	1
which	1
changed	1
his	1
appearance	1
for	1
the	1
worse.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
naively	1
festive	1
in	1
his	1
air,	1
which,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
his	1
firm	1
and	1
virile	1
features,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
rather	1
comical	1
expression.	1
Bekleshev	1
and	1
Theodore	1
Uvarov,	1
who	1
had	1
arrived	1
with	1
him,	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
doorway	1
to	1
allow	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
guest	1
of	1
honor,	1
to	1
enter	1
first.	1
Bagration	1
was	1
embarrassed,	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
avail	1
himself	1
of	1
their	1
courtesy,	1
and	1
this	1
caused	1
some	1
delay	1
at	1
the	1
doors,	1
but	1
after	1
all	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
enter	1
first.	1
He	1
walked	1
shyly	1
and	1
awkwardly	1
over	1
the	1
parquet	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
reception	1
room,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
hands;	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
accustomed	1
to	1
walk	1
over	1
a	1
plowed	1
field	1
under	1
fire,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Kursk	1
regiment	1
at	1
Schon	1
Grabern--and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
easier.	1
The	1
committeemen	1
met	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
door	1
and,	1
expressing	1
their	1
delight	1
at	1
seeing	1
such	1
a	1
highly	1
honored	1
guest,	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
reply,	1
surrounded	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
impossible	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door	1
for	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
members	1
and	1
guests	1
jostling	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
Bagration	1
over	1
each	1
other's	1
shoulders,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
some	1
rare	1
animal.	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
laughing	1
and	1
repeating	1
the	1
words,	1
"Make	1
way,	1
dear	1
boy!	1
Make	1
way,	1
make	1
way!"	1
pushed	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
more	1
energetically	1
than	1
anyone,	1
led	1
the	1
guests	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
and	1
seated	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
center	1
sofa.	1
The	1
bigwigs,	1
the	1
most	1
respected	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
club,	1
beset	1
the	1
new	1
arrivals.	1
Count	1
Ilya,	1
again	1
thrusting	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
crowd,	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
reappeared	1
a	1
minute	1
later	1
with	1
another	1
committeeman,	1
carrying	1
a	1
large	1
silver	1
salver	1
which	1
he	1
presented	1
to	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
On	1
the	1
salver	1
lay	1
some	1
verses	1
composed	1
and	1
printed	1
in	1
the	1
hero's	1
honor.	1
Bagration,	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
salver,	1
glanced	1
around	1
in	1
dismay,	1
as	1
though	1
seeking	1
help.	1
But	1
all	1
eyes	1
demanded	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
submit.	1
Feeling	1
himself	1
in	1
their	1
power,	1
he	1
resolutely	1
took	1
the	1
salver	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
reproachfully	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
who	1
had	1
presented	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
Someone	1
obligingly	1
took	1
the	1
dish	1
from	1
Bagration	1
(or	1
he	1
would,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
have	1
held	1
it	1
till	1
evening	1
and	1
have	1
gone	1
in	1
to	1
dinner	1
with	1
it)	1
and	1
drew	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
verses.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
them,	1
then!"	1
Bagration	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
and,	1
fixing	1
his	1
weary	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
paper,	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
fixed	1
and	1
serious	1
expression.	1
But	1
the	1
author	1
himself	1
took	1
the	1
verses	1
and	1
began	1
reading	1
them	1
aloud.	1
Bagration	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
listened:	1
	1
	1
Bring	1
glory	1
then	1
to	1
Alexander's	1
reign	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
our	1
Titus	1
shield.	1
A	1
dreaded	1
foe	1
be	1
thou,	1
kindhearted	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
A	1
Rhipheus	1
at	1
home,	1
a	1
Caesar	1
in	1
the	1
field!	1
E'en	1
fortunate	1
Napoleon	1
Knows	1
by	1
experience,	1
now,	1
Bagration,	1
And	1
dare	1
not	1
Herculean	1
Russians	1
trouble...	1
	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
reading,	1
a	1
stentorian	1
major-domo	1
announced	1
that	1
dinner	1
was	1
ready!	1
The	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
came	1
the	1
resounding	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
polonaise:	1
	1
	1
Conquest's	1
joyful	1
thunder	1
waken,	1
Triumph,	1
valiant	1
Russians,	1
now!...	1
	1
and	1
Count	1
Rostov,	1
glancing	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
author	1
who	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
his	1
verses,	1
bowed	1
to	1
Bagration.	1
Everyone	1
rose,	1
feeling	1
that	1
dinner	1
was	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
verses,	1
and	1
Bagration,	1
again	1
preceding	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
dinner.	1
He	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
honor	1
between	1
two	1
Alexanders--Bekleshev	1
and	1
Naryshkin--which	1
was	1
a	1
significant	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign.	1
Three	1
hundred	1
persons	1
took	1
their	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
rank	1
and	1
importance:	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
honored	1
guest,	1
as	1
naturally	1
as	1
water	1
flows	1
deepest	1
where	1
the	1
land	1
lies	1
lowest.	1
	1
Just	1
before	1
dinner,	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
presented	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
Bagration,	1
who	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
him,	1
disjointed	1
and	1
awkward,	1
as	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
spoke	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
looked	1
joyfully	1
and	1
proudly	1
around	1
while	1
Bagration	1
spoke	1
to	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
Denisov	1
and	1
his	1
new	1
acquaintance,	1
Dolokhov,	1
sat	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
Facing	1
them	1
sat	1
Pierre,	1
beside	1
Prince	1
Nesvitski.	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
sat	1
facing	1
Bagration	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
very	1
personification	1
of	1
Moscow	1
hospitality,	1
did	1
the	1
honors	1
to	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
His	1
efforts	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
vain.	1
The	1
dinner,	1
both	1
the	1
Lenten	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
fare,	1
was	1
splendid,	1
yet	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
quite	1
at	1
ease	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
meal.	1
He	1
winked	1
at	1
the	1
butler,	1
whispered	1
directions	1
to	1
the	1
footmen,	1
and	1
awaited	1
each	1
expected	1
dish	1
with	1
some	1
anxiety.	1
Everything	1
was	1
excellent.	1
With	1
the	1
second	1
course,	1
a	1
gigantic	1
sterlet	1
(at	1
sight	1
of	1
which	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
blushed	1
with	1
self-conscious	1
pleasure),	1
the	1
footmen	1
began	1
popping	1
corks	1
and	1
filling	1
the	1
champagne	1
glasses.	1
After	1
the	1
fish,	1
which	1
made	1
a	1
certain	1
sensation,	1
the	1
count	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
committeemen.	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
many	1
toasts,	1
it's	1
time	1
to	1
begin,"	1
he	1
whispered,	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
glass,	1
he	1
rose.	1
All	1
were	1
silent,	1
waiting	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
our	1
Sovereign,	1
the	1
Emperor!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
his	1
kindly	1
eyes	1
grew	1
moist	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
enthusiasm.	1
The	1
band	1
immediately	1
struck	1
up	1
"Conquest's	1
joyful	1
thunder	1
waken..."	1
All	1
rose	1
and	1
cried	1
"Hurrah!"	1
Bagration	1
also	1
rose	1
and	1
shouted	1
"Hurrah!"	1
in	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
shouted	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
Schon	1
Grabern.	1
Young	1
Rostov's	1
ecstatic	1
voice	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
above	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
others.	1
He	1
nearly	1
wept.	1
"To	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
our	1
Sovereign,	1
the	1
Emperor!"	1
he	1
roared,	1
"Hurrah!"	1
and	1
emptying	1
his	1
glass	1
at	1
one	1
gulp	1
he	1
dashed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
floor.	1
Many	1
followed	1
his	1
example,	1
and	1
the	1
loud	1
shouting	1
continued	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
When	1
the	1
voices	1
subsided,	1
the	1
footmen	1
cleared	1
away	1
the	1
broken	1
glass	1
and	1
everybody	1
sat	1
down	1
again,	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
and	1
exchanging	1
remarks.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
rose	1
once	1
more,	1
glanced	1
at	1
a	1
note	1
lying	1
beside	1
his	1
plate,	1
and	1
proposed	1
a	1
toast,	1
"To	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
hero	1
of	1
our	1
last	1
campaign,	1
Prince	1
Peter	1
Ivanovich	1
Bagration!"	1
and	1
again	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
grew	1
moist.	1
"Hurrah!"	1
cried	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
voices	1
again,	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
a	1
choir	1
began	1
singing	1
a	1
cantata	1
composed	1
by	1
Paul	1
Ivanovich	1
Kutuzov:	1
	1
	1
Russians!	1
O'er	1
all	1
barriers	1
on!	1
Courage	1
conquest	1
guarantees;	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
Bagration?	1
He	1
brings	1
foe	1
men	1
to	1
their	1
knees,...	1
etc.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
singing	1
was	1
over,	1
another	1
and	1
another	1
toast	1
was	1
proposed	1
and	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
moved,	1
more	1
glass	1
was	1
smashed,	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
grew	1
louder.	1
They	1
drank	1
to	1
Bekleshev,	1
Naryshkin,	1
Uvarov,	1
Dolgorukov,	1
Apraksin,	1
Valuev,	1
to	1
the	1
committee,	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
club	1
members	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
club	1
guests,	1
and	1
finally	1
to	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
separately,	1
as	1
the	1
organizer	1
of	1
the	1
banquet.	1
At	1
that	1
toast,	1
the	1
count	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
and,	1
covering	1
his	1
face,	1
wept	1
outright.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
opposite	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov.	1
As	1
usual,	1
he	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1
much,	1
and	1
eagerly.	1
But	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
intimately	1
noticed	1
that	1
some	1
great	1
change	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
him	1
that	1
day.	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
all	1
through	1
dinner	1
and	1
looked	1
about,	1
blinking	1
and	1
scowling,	1
or,	1
with	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
complete	1
absent-mindedness,	1
kept	1
rubbing	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
his	1
nose.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
depressed	1
and	1
gloomy.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
absorbed	1
by	1
some	1
depressing	1
and	1
unsolved	1
problem.	1
	1
The	1
unsolved	1
problem	1
that	1
tormented	1
him	1
was	1
caused	1
by	1
hints	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
princess,	1
his	1
cousin,	1
at	1
Moscow,	1
concerning	1
Dolokhov's	1
intimacy	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
by	1
an	1
anonymous	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
that	1
morning,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
jocular	1
way	1
common	1
to	1
anonymous	1
letters	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
badly	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
wife's	1
connection	1
with	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
a	1
secret	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
himself.	1
Pierre	1
absolutely	1
disbelieved	1
both	1
the	1
princess'	1
hints	1
and	1
the	1
letter,	1
but	1
he	1
feared	1
now	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
him.	1
Every	1
time	1
he	1
chanced	1
to	1
meet	1
Dolokhov's	1
handsome	1
insolent	1
eyes,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
monstrous	1
rising	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
turned	1
quickly	1
away.	1
Involuntarily	1
recalling	1
his	1
wife's	1
past	1
and	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
Dolokhov,	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
letter	1
might	1
be	1
true,	1
or	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
referred	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
He	1
involuntarily	1
remembered	1
how	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
had	1
fully	1
recovered	1
his	1
former	1
position	1
after	1
the	1
campaign,	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
him.	1
Availing	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
friendly	1
relations	1
with	1
Pierre	1
as	1
a	1
boon	1
companion,	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
come	1
straight	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
had	1
put	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
lent	1
him	1
money.	1
Pierre	1
recalled	1
how	1
Helene	1
had	1
smilingly	1
expressed	1
disapproval	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
living	1
at	1
their	1
house,	1
and	1
how	1
cynically	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
praised	1
his	1
wife's	1
beauty	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
till	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow	1
had	1
not	1
left	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
day.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
handsome,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"and	1
I	1
know	1
him.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
particularly	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
dishonor	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
ridicule	1
me,	1
just	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
exerted	1
myself	1
on	1
his	1
behalf,	1
befriended	1
him,	1
and	1
helped	1
him.	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
understand	1
what	1
a	1
spice	1
that	1
would	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
deceiving	1
me,	1
if	1
it	1
really	1
were	1
true.	1
Yes,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
true,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to,	1
and	1
can't,	1
believe	1
it."	1
He	1
remembered	1
the	1
expression	1
Dolokhov's	1
face	1
assumed	1
in	1
his	1
moments	1
of	1
cruelty,	1
as	1
when	1
tying	1
the	1
policeman	1
to	1
the	1
bear	1
and	1
dropping	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
challenged	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
a	1
duel	1
without	1
any	1
reason,	1
or	1
shot	1
a	1
post-boy's	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
pistol.	1
That	1
expression	1
was	1
often	1
on	1
Dolokhov's	1
face	1
when	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
bully,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"to	1
kill	1
a	1
man	1
means	1
nothing	1
to	1
him.	1
It	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
everyone	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
must	1
please	1
him.	1
He	1
must	1
think	1
that	1
I,	1
too,	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him--and	1
in	1
fact	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
felt	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
monstrous	1
rising	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
Dolokhov,	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
were	1
now	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
Pierre	1
and	1
seemed	1
very	1
gay.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
talking	1
merrily	1
to	1
his	1
two	1
friends,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
was	1
a	1
dashing	1
hussar	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
notorious	1
duelist	1
and	1
rake,	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
glanced	1
ironically	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
whose	1
preoccupied,	1
absent-minded,	1
and	1
massive	1
figure	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
noticeable	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
dinner.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
inimically	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
first	1
because	1
Pierre	1
appeared	1
to	1
his	1
hussar	1
eyes	1
as	1
a	1
rich	1
civilian,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
a	1
beauty,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
word--an	1
old	1
woman;	1
and	1
secondly	1
because	1
Pierre	1
in	1
his	1
preoccupation	1
and	1
absent-mindedness	1
had	1
not	1
recognized	1
Rostov	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
responded	1
to	1
his	1
greeting.	1
When	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
health	1
was	1
drunk,	1
Pierre,	1
lost	1
in	1
thought,	1
did	1
not	1
rise	1
or	1
lift	1
his	1
glass.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
about?"	1
shouted	1
Rostov,	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
ecstasy	1
of	1
exasperation.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
hear	1
it's	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
health?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
sighed,	1
rose	1
submissively,	1
emptied	1
his	1
glass,	1
and,	1
waiting	1
till	1
all	1
were	1
seated	1
again,	1
turned	1
with	1
his	1
kindly	1
smile	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Why,	1
I	1
didn't	1
recognize	1
you!"	1
he	1
said.	1
But	1
Rostov	1
was	1
otherwise	1
engaged;	1
he	1
was	1
shouting	1
"Hurrah!"	1
	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
renew	1
the	1
acquaintance?"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Confound	1
him,	1
he's	1
a	1
fool!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"One	1
should	1
make	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
husbands	1
of	1
pretty	1
women,"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
catch	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying,	1
but	1
knew	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
him.	1
He	1
reddened	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
handsome	1
women!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
serious	1
expression,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
lurking	1
at	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
he	1
turned	1
with	1
his	1
glass	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Here's	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
lovely	1
women,	1
Peterkin--and	1
their	1
lovers!"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes,	1
drank	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
glass	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Dolokhov	1
or	1
answering	1
him.	1
The	1
footman,	1
who	1
was	1
distributing	1
leaflets	1
with	1
Kutuzov's	1
cantata,	1
laid	1
one	1
before	1
Pierre	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
guests.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
when	1
Dolokhov,	1
leaning	1
across,	1
snatched	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
began	1
reading	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
dropped,	1
the	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
monstrous	1
that	1
had	1
tormented	1
him	1
all	1
dinnertime	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
leaned	1
his	1
whole	1
massive	1
body	1
across	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"How	1
dare	1
you	1
take	1
it?"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
Hearing	1
that	1
cry	1
and	1
seeing	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
addressed,	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
the	1
neighbor	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
quickly	1
turned	1
in	1
alarm	1
to	1
Bezukhov.	1
	1
"Don't!	1
Don't!	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
about?"	1
whispered	1
their	1
frightened	1
voices.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
clear,	1
mirthful,	1
cruel	1
eyes,	1
and	1
that	1
smile	1
of	1
his	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"Ah!	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
like!"	1
	1
"You	1
shan't	1
have	1
it!"	1
he	1
said	1
distinctly.	1
	1
Pale,	1
with	1
quivering	1
lips,	1
Pierre	1
snatched	1
the	1
copy.	1
	1
"You...!	1
you...	1
scoundrel!	1
I	1
challenge	1
you!"	1
he	1
ejaculated,	1
and,	1
pushing	1
back	1
his	1
chair,	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
and	1
uttered	1
those	1
words,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
his	1
wife's	1
guilt	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
tormenting	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
was	1
finally	1
and	1
indubitably	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative.	1
He	1
hated	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
forever	1
sundered	1
from	1
her.	1
Despite	1
Denisov's	1
request	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
Rostov	1
agreed	1
to	1
be	1
Dolokhov's	1
second,	1
and	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
discussed	1
the	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
duel	1
with	1
Nesvitski,	1
Bezukhov's	1
second.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
home,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
with	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
Denisov	1
stayed	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
till	1
late,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
gypsies	1
and	1
other	1
singers.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
till	1
tomorrow	1
at	1
Sokolniki,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
Rostov	1
in	1
the	1
club	1
porch.	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
quite	1
calm?"	1
Rostov	1
asked.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
paused.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
secret	1
of	1
dueling	1
in	1
two	1
words.	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
duel,	1
and	1
you	1
make	1
a	1
will	1
and	1
write	1
affectionate	1
letters	1
to	1
your	1
parents,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
killed,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
fool	1
and	1
are	1
lost	1
for	1
certain.	1
But	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
firm	1
intention	1
of	1
killing	1
your	1
man	1
as	1
quickly	1
and	1
surely	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
right,	1
as	1
our	1
bear	1
huntsman	1
at	1
Kostroma	1
used	1
to	1
tell	1
me.	1
'Everyone	1
fears	1
a	1
bear,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'but	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
one	1
your	1
fear's	1
all	1
gone,	1
and	1
your	1
only	1
thought	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
get	1
away!'	1
And	1
that's	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
A	1
demain,	1
mon	1
cher."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
Till	1
tomorrow,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
at	1
eight	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Nesvitski	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
Sokolniki	1
forest	1
and	1
found	1
Dolokhov,	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
already	1
there.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
preoccupied	1
with	1
considerations	1
which	1
had	1
no	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
hand.	1
His	1
haggard	1
face	1
was	1
yellow.	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
not	1
slept	1
that	1
night.	1
He	1
looked	1
about	1
distractedly	1
and	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
dazzled	1
by	1
the	1
sun.	1
He	1
was	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
by	1
two	1
considerations:	1
his	1
wife's	1
guilt,	1
of	1
which	1
after	1
his	1
sleepless	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
doubt,	1
and	1
the	1
guiltlessness	1
of	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
him....	1
"I	1
should	1
perhaps	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
in	1
his	1
place,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"It's	1
even	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same,	1
then	1
why	1
this	1
duel,	1
this	1
murder?	1
Either	1
I	1
shall	1
kill	1
him,	1
or	1
he	1
will	1
hit	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
or	1
elbow,	1
or	1
knee.	1
Can't	1
I	1
go	1
away	1
from	1
here,	1
run	1
away,	1
bury	1
myself	1
somewhere?"	1
passed	1
through	1
his	1
mind.	1
But	1
just	1
at	1
moments	1
when	1
such	1
thoughts	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
ask	1
in	1
a	1
particularly	1
calm	1
and	1
absent-minded	1
way,	1
which	1
inspired	1
the	1
respect	1
of	1
the	1
onlookers,	1
"Will	1
it	1
be	1
long?	1
Are	1
things	1
ready?"	1
	1
When	1
all	1
was	1
ready,	1
the	1
sabers	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
barriers,	1
and	1
the	1
pistols	1
loaded,	1
Nesvitski	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
doing	1
my	1
duty,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
timid	1
tones,	1
"and	1
should	1
not	1
justify	1
your	1
confidence	1
and	1
the	1
honor	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
in	1
choosing	1
me	1
for	1
your	1
second,	1
if	1
at	1
this	1
grave,	1
this	1
very	1
grave,	1
moment	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sufficient	1
ground	1
for	1
this	1
affair,	1
or	1
for	1
blood	1
to	1
be	1
shed	1
over	1
it....	1
You	1
were	1
not	1
right,	1
not	1
quite	1
in	1
the	1
right,	1
you	1
were	1
impetuous..."	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
it	1
is	1
horribly	1
stupid,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Then	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
express	1
your	1
regrets,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
your	1
opponent	1
will	1
accept	1
them,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
(who	1
like	1
the	1
others	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
affair,	1
and	1
like	1
everyone	1
in	1
similar	1
cases,	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
actual	1
duel).	1
"You	1
know,	1
Count,	1
it	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
honorable	1
to	1
admit	1
one's	1
mistake	1
than	1
to	1
let	1
matters	1
become	1
irreparable.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
insult	1
on	1
either	1
side.	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
convey...."	1
	1
"No!	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
talk	1
about?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
same....	1
Is	1
everything	1
ready?"	1
he	1
added.	1
"Only	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
where	1
to	1
shoot,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
unnaturally	1
gentle	1
smile.	1
	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
pistol	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
began	1
asking	1
about	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
the	1
trigger,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
before	1
held	1
a	1
pistol	1
in	1
his	1
hand--a	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
confess.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
like	1
that,	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
only	1
forgot,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"No	1
apologies,	1
none	1
whatever,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
to	1
Denisov	1
(who	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
had	1
been	1
attempting	1
a	1
reconciliation),	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
appointed	1
place.	1
	1
The	1
spot	1
chosen	1
for	1
the	1
duel	1
was	1
some	1
eighty	1
paces	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
where	1
the	1
sleighs	1
had	1
been	1
left,	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
clearing	1
in	1
the	1
pine	1
forest	1
covered	1
with	1
melting	1
snow,	1
the	1
frost	1
having	1
begun	1
to	1
break	1
up	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days.	1
The	1
antagonists	1
stood	1
forty	1
paces	1
apart	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
clearing.	1
The	1
seconds,	1
measuring	1
the	1
paces,	1
left	1
tracks	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
wet	1
snow	1
between	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
and	1
Nesvitski's	1
and	1
Dolokhov's	1
sabers,	1
which	1
were	1
stuck	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
ten	1
paces	1
apart	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
barrier.	1
It	1
was	1
thawing	1
and	1
misty;	1
at	1
forty	1
paces'	1
distance	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
For	1
three	1
minutes	1
all	1
had	1
been	1
ready,	1
but	1
they	1
still	1
delayed	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
"Well	1
begin!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"All	1
right,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
still	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
A	1
feeling	1
of	1
dread	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
so	1
lightly	1
begun	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
averted	1
but	1
was	1
taking	1
its	1
course	1
independently	1
of	1
men's	1
will.	1
	1
Denisov	1
first	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
barrier	1
and	1
announced:	1
"As	1
the	1
adve'sawies	1
have	1
wefused	1
a	1
weconciliation,	1
please	1
pwoceed.	1
Take	1
your	1
pistols,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
thwee	1
begin	1
to	1
advance.	1
	1
"O-ne!	1
T-wo!	1
Thwee!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
angrily	1
and	1
stepped	1
aside.	1
	1
The	1
combatants	1
advanced	1
along	1
the	1
trodden	1
tracks,	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
beginning	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
another	1
through	1
the	1
mist.	1
They	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
fire	1
when	1
they	1
liked	1
as	1
they	1
approached	1
the	1
barrier.	1
Dolokhov	1
walked	1
slowly	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
pistol,	1
looking	1
intently	1
with	1
his	1
bright,	1
sparkling	1
blue	1
eyes	1
into	1
his	1
antagonist's	1
face.	1
His	1
mouth	1
wore	1
its	1
usual	1
semblance	1
of	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
can	1
fire	1
when	1
I	1
like!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
"three,"	1
he	1
went	1
quickly	1
forward,	1
missing	1
the	1
trodden	1
path	1
and	1
stepping	1
into	1
the	1
deep	1
snow.	1
He	1
held	1
the	1
pistol	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
at	1
arm's	1
length,	1
apparently	1
afraid	1
of	1
shooting	1
himself	1
with	1
it.	1
His	1
left	1
hand	1
he	1
held	1
carefully	1
back,	1
because	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
support	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
knew	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
Having	1
advanced	1
six	1
paces	1
and	1
strayed	1
off	1
the	1
track	1
into	1
the	1
snow,	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
then	1
quickly	1
glanced	1
at	1
Dolokhov	1
and,	1
bending	1
his	1
finger	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
shown,	1
fired.	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
expecting	1
so	1
loud	1
a	1
report,	1
Pierre	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
and	1
then,	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
sensations,	1
stood	1
still.	1
The	1
smoke,	1
rendered	1
denser	1
by	1
the	1
mist,	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
seeing	1
anything	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
second	1
report	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
expected.	1
He	1
only	1
heard	1
Dolokhov's	1
hurried	1
steps,	1
and	1
his	1
figure	1
came	1
in	1
view	1
through	1
the	1
smoke.	1
He	1
was	1
pressing	1
one	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
left	1
side,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
clutched	1
his	1
drooping	1
pistol.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
pale.	1
Rostov	1
ran	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
something.	1
	1
"No-o-o!"	1
muttered	1
Dolokhov	1
through	1
his	1
teeth,	1
"no,	1
it's	1
not	1
over."	1
And	1
after	1
stumbling	1
a	1
few	1
staggering	1
steps	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
saber,	1
he	1
sank	1
on	1
the	1
snow	1
beside	1
it.	1
His	1
left	1
hand	1
was	1
bloody;	1
he	1
wiped	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
supported	1
himself	1
with	1
it.	1
His	1
frowning	1
face	1
was	1
pallid	1
and	1
quivered.	1
	1
"Plea..."	1
began	1
Dolokhov,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
pronounce	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
"Please,"	1
he	1
uttered	1
with	1
an	1
effort.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
hardly	1
restraining	1
his	1
sobs,	1
began	1
running	1
toward	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
barriers,	1
when	1
Dolokhov	1
cried:	1
	1
"To	1
your	1
barrier!"	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
grasping	1
what	1
was	1
meant,	1
stopped	1
by	1
his	1
saber.	1
Only	1
ten	1
paces	1
divided	1
them.	1
Dolokhov	1
lowered	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
snow,	1
greedily	1
bit	1
at	1
it,	1
again	1
raised	1
his	1
head,	1
adjusted	1
himself,	1
drew	1
in	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
sat	1
up,	1
seeking	1
a	1
firm	1
center	1
of	1
gravity.	1
He	1
sucked	1
and	1
swallowed	1
the	1
cold	1
snow,	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
but	1
his	1
eyes,	1
still	1
smiling,	1
glittered	1
with	1
effort	1
and	1
exasperation	1
as	1
he	1
mustered	1
his	1
remaining	1
strength.	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
pistol	1
and	1
aimed.	1
	1
"Sideways!	1
Cover	1
yourself	1
with	1
your	1
pistol!"	1
ejaculated	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"Cover	1
yourself!"	1
even	1
Denisov	1
cried	1
to	1
his	1
adversary.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
smile	1
of	1
pity	1
and	1
remorse,	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
helplessly	1
spread	1
out,	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
broad	1
chest	1
directly	1
facing	1
Dolokhov	1
looked	1
sorrowfully	1
at	1
him.	1
Denisov,	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
Nesvitski	1
closed	1
their	1
eyes.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
report	1
and	1
Dolokhov's	1
angry	1
cry.	1
	1
"Missed!"	1
shouted	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
he	1
lay	1
helplessly,	1
face	1
downwards	1
on	1
the	1
snow.	1
	1
Pierre	1
clutched	1
his	1
temples,	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
forest,	1
trampling	1
through	1
the	1
deep	1
snow,	1
and	1
muttering	1
incoherent	1
words:	1
	1
"Folly...	1
folly!	1
Death...	1
lies..."	1
he	1
repeated,	1
puckering	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
stopped	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
home.	1
	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Denisov	1
drove	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
wounded	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
The	1
latter	1
lay	1
silent	1
in	1
the	1
sleigh	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
questions	1
addressed	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
on	1
entering	1
Moscow	1
he	1
suddenly	1
came	1
to	1
and,	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
an	1
effort,	1
took	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him,	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
totally	1
altered	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
rapturous	1
and	1
tender	1
expression	1
on	1
Dolokhov's	1
face.	1
	1
"Well?	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
feel?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Bad!	1
But	1
it's	1
not	1
that,	1
my	1
friend-"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
a	1
gasping	1
voice.	1
"Where	1
are	1
we?	1
In	1
Moscow,	1
I	1
know.	1
I	1
don't	1
matter,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
killed	1
her,	1
killed...	1
She	1
won't	1
get	1
over	1
it!	1
She	1
won't	1
survive...."	1
	1
"Who?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"My	1
mother!	1
My	1
mother,	1
my	1
angel,	1
my	1
adored	1
angel	1
mother,"	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
pressed	1
Rostov's	1
hand	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
little	1
quieter,	1
he	1
explained	1
to	1
Rostov	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
with	1
his	1
mother,	1
who,	1
if	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
dying,	1
would	1
not	1
survive	1
it.	1
He	1
implored	1
Rostov	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
prepare	1
her.	1
	1
Rostov	1
went	1
on	1
ahead	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
asked,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
surprise	1
learned	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
the	1
brawler,	1
Dolokhov	1
the	1
bully,	1
lived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
mother	1
and	1
a	1
hunchback	1
sister,	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
affectionate	1
of	1
sons	1
and	1
brothers.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
rarely	1
seen	1
his	1
wife	1
alone.	1
Both	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
in	1
Moscow	1
their	1
house	1
was	1
always	1
full	1
of	1
visitors.	1
The	1
night	1
after	1
the	1
duel	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
bedroom	1
but,	1
as	1
he	1
often	1
did,	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
room,	1
that	1
huge	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
had	1
died.	1
	1
He	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
meaning	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep	1
and	1
forget	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
Such	1
a	1
storm	1
of	1
feelings,	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
memories	1
suddenly	1
arose	1
within	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fall	1
asleep,	1
nor	1
even	1
remain	1
in	1
one	1
place,	1
but	1
had	1
to	1
jump	1
up	1
and	1
pace	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps.	1
Now	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
marriage,	1
with	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
and	1
a	1
languid,	1
passionate	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
then	1
immediately	1
he	1
saw	1
beside	1
her	1
Dolokhov's	1
handsome,	1
insolent,	1
hard,	1
and	1
mocking	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
banquet,	1
and	1
then	1
that	1
same	1
face	1
pale,	1
quivering,	1
and	1
suffering,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
when	1
he	1
reeled	1
and	1
sank	1
on	1
the	1
snow.	1
	1
"What	1
has	1
happened?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself.	1
"I	1
have	1
killed	1
her	1
lover,	1
yes,	1
killed	1
my	1
wife's	1
lover.	1
Yes,	1
that	1
was	1
it!	1
And	1
why?	1
How	1
did	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
it?"--"Because	1
you	1
married	1
her,"	1
answered	1
an	1
inner	1
voice.	1
	1
"But	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
I	1
to	1
blame?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"In	1
marrying	1
her	1
without	1
loving	1
her;	1
in	1
deceiving	1
yourself	1
and	1
her."	1
And	1
he	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
that	1
moment	1
after	1
supper	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili's,	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
those	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
so	1
difficult	1
to	1
utter:	1
"I	1
love	1
you."	1
"It	1
all	1
comes	1
from	1
that!	1
Even	1
then	1
I	1
felt	1
it,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"I	1
felt	1
then	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
turns	1
out."	1
	1
He	1
remembered	1
his	1
honeymoon	1
and	1
blushed	1
at	1
the	1
recollection.	1
Particularly	1
vivid,	1
humiliating,	1
and	1
shameful	1
was	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
how	1
one	1
day	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
marriage	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bedroom	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
noon	1
in	1
his	1
silk	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
found	1
his	1
head	1
steward	1
there,	1
who,	1
bowing	1
respectfully,	1
looked	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
smiled	1
slightly,	1
as	1
if	1
expressing	1
respectful	1
understanding	1
of	1
his	1
employer's	1
happiness.	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
often	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
proud	1
of	1
her,	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
majestic	1
beauty	1
and	1
social	1
tact,"	1
thought	1
he;	1
"been	1
proud	1
of	1
my	1
house,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
received	1
all	1
Petersburg,	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
unapproachability	1
and	1
beauty.	1
So	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
proud	1
of!	1
I	1
then	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
her.	1
How	1
often	1
when	1
considering	1
her	1
character	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
not	1
understanding	1
her,	1
for	1
not	1
understanding	1
that	1
constant	1
composure	1
and	1
complacency	1
and	1
lack	1
of	1
all	1
interests	1
or	1
desires,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
secret	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
terrible	1
truth	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
depraved	1
woman.	1
Now	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
that	1
terrible	1
word	1
to	1
myself	1
all	1
has	1
become	1
clear.	1
	1
"Anatole	1
used	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
borrow	1
money	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
naked	1
shoulders.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
money,	1
but	1
let	1
herself	1
be	1
kissed.	1
Her	1
father	1
in	1
jest	1
tried	1
to	1
rouse	1
her	1
jealousy,	1
and	1
she	1
replied	1
with	1
a	1
calm	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
stupid	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
jealous:	1
'Let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
pleases,'	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
me.	1
One	1
day	1
I	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
any	1
symptoms	1
of	1
pregnancy.	1
She	1
laughed	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
fool	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
children,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
children	1
by	1
me."	1
	1
Then	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
coarseness	1
and	1
bluntness	1
of	1
her	1
thoughts	1
and	1
the	1
vulgarity	1
of	1
the	1
expressions	1
that	1
were	1
natural	1
to	1
her,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
aristocratic	1
circles.	1
	1
"I'm	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
fool....	1
Just	1
you	1
try	1
it	1
on....	1
Allez-vous	1
promener,"	1
*	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
say.	1
Often	1
seeing	1
the	1
success	1
she	1
had	1
with	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"You	1
clear	1
out	1
of	1
this."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
never	1
loved	1
her,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself;	1
"I	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
depraved	1
woman,"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
"but	1
dared	1
not	1
admit	1
it	1
to	1
myself.	1
And	1
now	1
there's	1
Dolokhov	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
smile	1
and	1
perhaps	1
dying,	1
while	1
meeting	1
my	1
remorse	1
with	1
some	1
forced	1
bravado!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
who,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
weak	1
character,	1
do	1
not	1
seek	1
a	1
confidant	1
in	1
their	1
troubles.	1
He	1
digested	1
his	1
sufferings	1
alone.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
all,	1
all	1
her	1
fault,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself;	1
"but	1
what	1
of	1
that?	1
Why	1
did	1
I	1
bind	1
myself	1
to	1
her?	1
Why	1
did	1
I	1
say	1
'Je	1
vous	1
aime'	1
*	1
to	1
her,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
worse	1
than	1
a	1
lie?	1
I	1
am	1
guilty	1
and	1
must	1
endure...	1
what?	1
A	1
slur	1
on	1
my	1
name?	1
A	1
misfortune	1
for	1
life?	1
Oh,	1
that's	1
nonsense,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"The	1
slur	1
on	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
honor--that's	1
all	1
apart	1
from	1
myself."	1
	1
	1
*	1
I	1
love	1
you.	1
	1
"Louis	1

and	1

came	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
head,	1
"and	1
from	1
their	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
they	1
were	1
right,	1
as	1
were	1
those	1
too	1
who	1
canonized	1
him	1
and	1
died	1
a	1
martyr's	1
death	1
for	1
his	1
sake.	1
Then	1
Robespierre	1
was	1
beheaded	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
despot.	1
Who	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
wrong?	1
No	1
one!	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
alive--live:	1
tomorrow	1
you'll	1
die	1
as	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
died	1
an	1
hour	1
ago.	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
worth	1
tormenting	1
oneself,	1
when	1
one	1
has	1
only	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
eternity?"	1
	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
imagined	1
himself	1
calmed	1
by	1
such	1
reflections,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
moments	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
most	1
strongly	1
expressed	1
his	1
insincere	1
love	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
blood	1
rush	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
had	1
again	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
move	1
about	1
and	1
break	1
and	1
tear	1
whatever	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Why	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
'Je	1
vous	1
aime'?"	1
he	1
kept	1
repeating	1
to	1
himself.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
tenth	1
time,	1
Moliere's	1
words:	1
"Mais	1
que	1
diable	1
allait-il	1
faire	1
dans	1
cette	1
galere?"*	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
himself.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"But	1
what	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
he	1
doing	1
in	1
that	1
galley?"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
valet	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
pack	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
now.	1
He	1
resolved	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
leave	1
a	1
letter	1
informing	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
her	1
forever.	1
	1
Next	1
morning	1
when	1
the	1
valet	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
coffee,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
lying	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
ottoman	1
with	1
an	1
open	1
book	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
He	1
woke	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
a	1
startled	1
expression,	1
unable	1
to	1
realize	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
"The	1
countess	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
your	1
excellency	1
was	1
at	1
home,"	1
said	1
the	1
valet.	1
	1
But	1
before	1
Pierre	1
could	1
decide	1
what	1
answer	1
he	1
would	1
send,	1
the	1
countess	1
herself	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
satin	1
dressing	1
gown	1
embroidered	1
with	1
silver	1
and	1
with	1
simply	1
dressed	1
hair	1
(two	1
immense	1
plaits	1
twice	1
round	1
her	1
lovely	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
coronet)	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
calm	1
and	1
majestic,	1
except	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
wrathful	1
wrinkle	1
on	1
her	1
rather	1
prominent	1
marble	1
brow.	1
With	1
her	1
imperturbable	1
calm	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
valet.	1
She	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
duel	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
it.	1
She	1
waited	1
till	1
the	1
valet	1
had	1
set	1
down	1
the	1
coffee	1
things	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
timidly	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
hare	1
surrounded	1
by	1
hounds	1
who	1
lays	1
back	1
her	1
ears	1
and	1
continues	1
to	1
crouch	1
motionless	1
before	1
her	1
enemies,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
continue	1
reading.	1
But	1
feeling	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
senseless	1
and	1
impossible,	1
he	1
again	1
glanced	1
timidly	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
smile,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
valet	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what's	1
this	1
now?	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
now,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know?"	1
she	1
asked	1
sternly.	1
	1
"I?	1
What	1
have	1
I...?"	1
stammered	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
seems	1
you're	1
a	1
hero,	1
eh?	1
Come	1
now,	1
what	1
was	1
this	1
duel	1
about?	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
meant	1
to	1
prove?	1
What?	1
I	1
ask	1
you."	1
	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
over	1
heavily	1
on	1
the	1
ottoman	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
won't	1
answer,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you..."	1
Helene	1
went	1
on.	1
"You	1
believe	1
everything	1
you're	1
told.	1
You	1
were	1
told..."	1
Helene	1
laughed,	1
"that	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
my	1
lover,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
French	1
with	1
her	1
coarse	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech,	1
uttering	1
the	1
word	1
amant	1
as	1
casually	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
word,	1
"and	1
you	1
believed	1
it!	1
Well,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
proved?	1
What	1
does	1
this	1
duel	1
prove?	1
That	1
you're	1
a	1
fool,	1
que	1
vous	1
etes	1
un	1
sot,	1
but	1
everybody	1
knew	1
that.	1
What	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
result?	1
That	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
laughingstock	1
of	1
all	1
Moscow,	1
that	1
everyone	1
will	1
say	1
that	1
you,	1
drunk	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
about,	1
challenged	1
a	1
man	1
you	1
are	1
jealous	1
of	1
without	1
cause."	1
Helene	1
raised	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
excited,	1
"A	1
man	1
who's	1
a	1
better	1
man	1
than	1
you	1
in	1
every	1
way..."	1
	1
"Hm...	1
Hm...!"	1
growled	1
Pierre,	1
frowning	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
not	1
moving	1
a	1
muscle.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
believe	1
he	1
was	1
my	1
lover?	1
Why?	1
Because	1
I	1
like	1
his	1
company?	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
cleverer	1
and	1
more	1
agreeable,	1
I	1
should	1
prefer	1
yours."	1
	1
"Don't	1
speak	1
to	1
me...	1
I	1
beg	1
you,"	1
muttered	1
Pierre	1
hoarsely.	1
	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
I	1
speak?	1
I	1
can	1
speak	1
as	1
I	1
like,	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
plainly	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
wives	1
with	1
husbands	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
taken	1
lovers	1
(des	1
amants),	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
so,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
eyes	1
whose	1
strange	1
expression	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand,	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
again.	1
He	1
was	1
suffering	1
physically	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
weight	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
breathe.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
do	1
something	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
this	1
suffering,	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
too	1
terrible.	1
	1
"We	1
had	1
better	1
separate,"	1
he	1
muttered	1
in	1
a	1
broken	1
voice.	1
	1
"Separate?	1
Very	1
well,	1
but	1
only	1
if	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
fortune,"	1
said	1
Helene.	1
"Separate!	1
That's	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
frighten	1
me	1
with!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
leaped	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
rushed	1
staggering	1
toward	1
her.	1
	1
"I'll	1
kill	1
you!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
marble	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
strength	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
felt,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
step	1
toward	1
her	1
brandishing	1
the	1
slab.	1
	1
Helene's	1
face	1
became	1
terrible,	1
she	1
shrieked	1
and	1
sprang	1
aside.	1
His	1
father's	1
nature	1
showed	1
itself	1
in	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
felt	1
the	1
fascination	1
and	1
delight	1
of	1
frenzy.	1
He	1
flung	1
down	1
the	1
slab,	1
broke	1
it,	1
and	1
swooping	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
with	1
outstretched	1
hands	1
shouted,	1
"Get	1
out!"	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
terrible	1
voice	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
heard	1
it	1
with	1
horror.	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
had	1
Helene	1
not	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
A	1
week	1
later	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
his	1
wife	1
full	1
power	1
to	1
control	1
all	1
his	1
estates	1
in	1
Great	1
Russia,	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
larger	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
property,	1
and	1
left	1
for	1
Petersburg	1
alone.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Two	1
months	1
had	1
elapsed	1
since	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
reached	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
letters	1
sent	1
through	1
the	1
embassy	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
searches	1
made,	1
his	1
body	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
found	1
nor	1
was	1
he	1
on	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
prisoners.	1
What	1
was	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
his	1
relations	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
been	1
picked	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
now	1
be	1
lying,	1
recovering	1
or	1
dying,	1
alone	1
among	1
strangers	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
send	1
news	1
of	1
himself.	1
The	1
gazettes	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
first	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
defeat	1
at	1
Austerlitz	1
stated,	1
as	1
usual	1
very	1
briefly	1
and	1
vaguely,	1
that	1
after	1
brilliant	1
engagements	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
retreat	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
their	1
withdrawal	1
in	1
perfect	1
order.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
understood	1
from	1
this	1
official	1
report	1
that	1
our	1
army	1
had	1
been	1
defeated.	1
A	1
week	1
after	1
the	1
gazette	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
came	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Kutuzov	1
informing	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
fate	1
that	1
had	1
befallen	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"Your	1
son,"	1
wrote	1
Kutuzov,	1
"fell	1
before	1
my	1
eyes,	1
a	1
standard	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
regiment--he	1
fell	1
as	1
a	1
hero,	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
fatherland.	1
To	1
the	1
great	1
regret	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
uncertain	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
alive	1
or	1
not.	1
I	1
comfort	1
myself	1
and	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
your	1
son	1
is	1
alive,	1
for	1
otherwise	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
mentioned	1
among	1
the	1
officers	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
whom	1
has	1
been	1
sent	1
me	1
under	1
flag	1
of	1
truce."	1
	1
After	1
receiving	1
this	1
news	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
study,	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
went	1
for	1
his	1
walk	1
as	1
usual	1
next	1
morning,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
with	1
his	1
steward,	1
the	1
gardener,	1
and	1
the	1
architect,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
grim	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
anyone.	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
usual	1
hour	1
he	1
was	1
working	1
at	1
his	1
lathe	1
and,	1
as	1
usual,	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Princess	1
Mary!"	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
voice,	1
throwing	1
down	1
his	1
chisel.	1
(The	1
wheel	1
continued	1
to	1
revolve	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
impetus,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
long	1
remembered	1
the	1
dying	1
creak	1
of	1
that	1
wheel,	1
which	1
merged	1
in	1
her	1
memory	1
with	1
what	1
followed.)	1
	1
She	1
approached	1
him,	1
saw	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
something	1
gave	1
way	1
within	1
her.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim.	1
By	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
face,	1
not	1
sad,	1
not	1
crushed,	1
but	1
angry	1
and	1
working	1
unnaturally,	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
hanging	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
about	1
to	1
crush	1
her	1
was	1
some	1
terrible	1
misfortune,	1
the	1
worst	1
in	1
life,	1
one	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
experienced,	1
irreparable	1
and	1
incomprehensible-	1
-the	1
death	1
of	1
one	1
she	1
loved.	1
	1
"Father!	1
Andrew!"--said	1
the	1
ungraceful,	1
awkward	1
princess	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
indescribable	1
charm	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
self-forgetfulness	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
her	1
look	1
but	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
sob.	1
	1
"Bad	1
news!	1
He's	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
prisoners	1
nor	1
among	1
the	1
killed!	1
Kutuzov	1
writes..."	1
and	1
he	1
screamed	1
as	1
piercingly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
drive	1
the	1
princess	1
away	1
by	1
that	1
scream...	1
"Killed!"	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
down	1
or	1
faint.	1
She	1
was	1
already	1
pale,	1
but	1
on	1
hearing	1
these	1
words	1
her	1
face	1
changed	1
and	1
something	1
brightened	1
in	1
her	1
beautiful,	1
radiant	1
eyes.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
joy--a	1
supreme	1
joy	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
joys	1
and	1
sorrows	1
of	1
this	1
world--overflowed	1
the	1
great	1
grief	1
within	1
her.	1
She	1
forgot	1
all	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
took	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
drawing	1
him	1
down	1
put	1
her	1
arm	1
round	1
his	1
thin,	1
scraggy	1
neck.	1
	1
"Father,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"do	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
me,	1
let	1
us	1
weep	1
together."	1
	1
"Scoundrels!	1
Blackguards!"	1
shrieked	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
turning	1
his	1
face	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
"Destroying	1
the	1
army,	1
destroying	1
the	1
men!	1
And	1
why?	1
Go,	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
Lise."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
sank	1
helplessly	1
into	1
an	1
armchair	1
beside	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
wept.	1
She	1
saw	1
her	1
brother	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
of	1
Lise,	1
his	1
look	1
tender	1
yet	1
proud.	1
She	1
saw	1
him	1
tender	1
and	1
amused	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
icon.	1
"Did	1
he	1
believe?	1
Had	1
he	1
repented	1
of	1
his	1
unbelief?	1
Was	1
he	1
now	1
there?	1
There	1
in	1
the	1
realms	1
of	1
eternal	1
peace	1
and	1
blessedness?"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
"Father,	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
it	1
happened,"	1
she	1
asked	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
	1
"Go!	1
Go!	1
Killed	1
in	1
battle,	1
where	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
Russian	1
men	1
and	1
Russia's	1
glory	1
were	1
led	1
to	1
destruction.	1
Go,	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Go	1
and	1
tell	1
Lise.	1
I	1
will	1
follow."	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
returned	1
from	1
her	1
father,	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
sat	1
working	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
with	1
that	1
curious	1
expression	1
of	1
inner,	1
happy	1
calm	1
peculiar	1
to	1
pregnant	1
women.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
her	1
eyes	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
but	1
were	1
looking	1
within...	1
into	1
herself...	1
at	1
something	1
joyful	1
and	1
mysterious	1
taking	1
place	1
within	1
her.	1
	1
"Mary,"	1
she	1
said,	1
moving	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
embroidery	1
frame	1
and	1
lying	1
back,	1
"give	1
me	1
your	1
hand."	1
She	1
took	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
hand	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
below	1
her	1
waist.	1
	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
smiling	1
expectantly,	1
her	1
downy	1
lip	1
rose	1
and	1
remained	1
lifted	1
in	1
childlike	1
happiness.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
knelt	1
down	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
dress.	1
	1
"There,	1
there!	1
Do	1
you	1
feel	1
it?	1
I	1
feel	1
so	1
strange.	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
Mary,	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
very	1
much,"	1
said	1
Lise,	1
looking	1
with	1
bright	1
and	1
happy	1
eyes	1
at	1
her	1
sister-in-law.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
could	1
not	1
lift	1
her	1
head,	1
she	1
was	1
weeping.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
Mary?"	1
	1
"Nothing...	1
only	1
I	1
feel	1
sad...	1
sad	1
about	1
Andrew,"	1
she	1
said,	1
wiping	1
away	1
her	1
tears	1
on	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
knee.	1
	1
Several	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
began	1
trying	1
to	1
prepare	1
her	1
sister-in-law,	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
Unobservant	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
these	1
tears,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand,	1
agitated	1
her.	1
She	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
looked	1
about	1
uneasily	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
something.	1
Before	1
dinner	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
of	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
afraid,	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
restless	1
and	1
malign	1
expression	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
then	1
sat	1
thinking	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
that	1
expression	1
of	1
attention	1
to	1
something	1
within	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
seen	1
in	1
pregnant	1
women,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Has	1
anything	1
come	1
from	1
Andrew?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
know	1
it's	1
too	1
soon	1
for	1
news.	1
But	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
anxious	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
afraid."	1
	1
"So	1
there's	1
nothing?"	1
	1
"Nothing,"	1
answered	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
looking	1
firmly	1
with	1
her	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
at	1
her	1
sister-in-law.	1
	1
She	1
had	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
and	1
persuaded	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
terrible	1
news	1
from	1
her	1
till	1
after	1
her	1
confinement,	1
which	1
was	1
expected	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
each	1
bore	1
and	1
hid	1
their	1
grief	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
way.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
would	1
not	1
cherish	1
any	1
hope:	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
sent	1
an	1
official	1
to	1
Austria	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
traces	1
of	1
his	1
son,	1
he	1
ordered	1
a	1
monument	1
from	1
Moscow	1
which	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
erect	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
garden	1
to	1
his	1
memory,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
everybody	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
been	1
killed.	1
He	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
former	1
way	1
of	1
life,	1
but	1
his	1
strength	1
failed	1
him.	1
He	1
walked	1
less,	1
ate	1
less,	1
slept	1
less,	1
and	1
became	1
weaker	1
every	1
day.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
hoped.	1
She	1
prayed	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
as	1
living	1
and	1
was	1
always	1
awaiting	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
return.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
"Dearest,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
after	1
breakfast	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
March,	1
and	1
her	1
downy	1
little	1
lip	1
rose	1
from	1
old	1
habit,	1
but	1
as	1
sorrow	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
every	1
smile,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
every	1
word,	1
and	1
even	1
every	1
footstep	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
since	1
the	1
terrible	1
news	1
had	1
come,	1
so	1
now	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess--influenced	1
by	1
the	1
general	1
mood	1
though	1
without	1
knowing	1
its	1
cause--was	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
remind	1
one	1
still	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
sorrow.	1
	1
"Dearest,	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
this	1
morning's	1
fruschtique	1
*--as	1
Foka	1
the	1
cook	1
calls	1
it--has	1
disagreed	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Fruhstuck:	1
breakfast.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
darling?	1
You	1
look	1
pale.	1
Oh,	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
pale!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
alarm,	1
running	1
with	1
her	1
soft,	1
ponderous	1
steps	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
sister-in-law.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
should	1
not	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna	1
be	1
sent	1
for?"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
who	1
was	1
present.	1
(Mary	1
Bogdanovna	1
was	1
a	1
midwife	1
from	1
the	1
neighboring	1
town,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
fortnight.)	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,"	1
assented	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
"perhaps	1
that's	1
it.	1
I'll	1
go.	1
Courage,	1
my	1
angel."	1
She	1
kissed	1
Lise	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
no!"	1
And	1
besides	1
the	1
pallor	1
and	1
the	1
physical	1
suffering	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
face,	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
childish	1
fear	1
of	1
inevitable	1
pain	1
showed	1
itself.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
only	1
indigestion?...	1
Say	1
it's	1
only	1
indigestion,	1
say	1
so,	1
Mary!	1
Say..."	1
And	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
capriciously	1
like	1
a	1
suffering	1
child	1
and	1
to	1
wring	1
her	1
little	1
hands	1
even	1
with	1
some	1
affectation.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
fetch	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna.	1
	1
"Mon	1
Dieu!	1
Mon	1
Dieu!	1
Oh!"	1
she	1
heard	1
as	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
midwife	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
rubbing	1
her	1
small,	1
plump	1
white	1
hands	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
calm	1
importance.	1
	1
"Mary	1
Bogdanovna,	1
I	1
think	1
it's	1
beginning!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
midwife	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
of	1
alarm.	1
	1
"Well,	1
the	1
Lord	1
be	1
thanked,	1
Princess,"	1
said	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna,	1
not	1
hastening	1
her	1
steps.	1
"You	1
young	1
ladies	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
the	1
doctor	1
from	1
Moscow	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
yet?"	1
said	1
the	1
princess.	1
(In	1
accordance	1
with	1
Lise's	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
wishes	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
a	1
doctor	1
and	1
were	1
expecting	1
him	1
at	1
any	1
moment.)	1
	1
"No	1
matter,	1
Princess,	1
don't	1
be	1
alarmed,"	1
said	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna.	1
"We'll	1
manage	1
very	1
well	1
without	1
a	1
doctor."	1
	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
from	1
her	1
room	1
heard	1
something	1
heavy	1
being	1
carried	1
by.	1
She	1
looked	1
out.	1
The	1
men	1
servants	1
were	1
carrying	1
the	1
large	1
leather	1
sofa	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
study	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
On	1
their	1
faces	1
was	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
solemn	1
look.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sat	1
alone	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
opening	1
her	1
door	1
when	1
someone	1
passed	1
and	1
watching	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
Some	1
women	1
passing	1
with	1
quiet	1
steps	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bedroom	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
ask	1
any	1
questions,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
again,	1
now	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
easy	1
chair,	1
now	1
taking	1
her	1
prayer	1
book,	1
now	1
kneeling	1
before	1
the	1
icon	1
stand.	1
To	1
her	1
surprise	1
and	1
distress	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
her	1
prayers	1
did	1
not	1
calm	1
her	1
excitement.	1
Suddenly	1
her	1
door	1
opened	1
softly	1
and	1
her	1
old	1
nurse,	1
Praskovya	1
Savishna,	1
who	1
hardly	1
ever	1
came	1
to	1
that	1
room	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
forbidden	1
it,	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
with	1
a	1
shawl	1
round	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"I've	1
come	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
you	1
a	1
bit,	1
Masha,"	1
said	1
the	1
nurse,	1
"and	1
here	1
I've	1
brought	1
the	1
prince's	1
wedding	1
candles	1
to	1
light	1
before	1
his	1
saint,	1
my	1
angel,"	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
nurse,	1
I'm	1
so	1
glad!"	1
	1
"God	1
is	1
merciful,	1
birdie."	1
	1
The	1
nurse	1
lit	1
the	1
gilt	1
candles	1
before	1
the	1
icons	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
her	1
knitting.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
took	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
began	1
reading.	1
Only	1
when	1
footsteps	1
or	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
did	1
they	1
look	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
the	1
princess	1
anxious	1
and	1
inquiring,	1
the	1
nurse	1
encouraging.	1
Everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
dominated	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
experienced	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
her	1
room.	1
But	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
superstition	1
that	1
the	1
fewer	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
know	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
less	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail	1
suffers,	1
everyone	1
tried	1
to	1
pretend	1
not	1
to	1
know;	1
no	1
one	1
spoke	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
ordinary	1
staid	1
and	1
respectful	1
good	1
manners	1
habitual	1
in	1
the	1
prince's	1
household,	1
a	1
common	1
anxiety,	1
a	1
softening	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
a	1
consciousness	1
that	1
something	1
great	1
and	1
mysterious	1
was	1
being	1
accomplished	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
made	1
itself	1
felt.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
laughter	1
in	1
the	1
maids'	1
large	1
hall.	1
In	1
the	1
men	1
servants'	1
hall	1
all	1
sat	1
waiting,	1
silently	1
and	1
alert.	1
In	1
the	1
outlying	1
serfs'	1
quarters	1
torches	1
and	1
candles	1
were	1
burning	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
slept.	1
The	1
old	1
prince,	1
stepping	1
on	1
his	1
heels,	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
sent	1
Tikhon	1
to	1
ask	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna	1
what	1
news.--"Say	1
only	1
that	1
'the	1
prince	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
ask,'	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
her	1
answer."	1
	1
"Inform	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
labor	1
has	1
begun,"	1
said	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna,	1
giving	1
the	1
messenger	1
a	1
significant	1
look.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"Very	1
good!"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
Tikhon	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
slightest	1
sound	1
from	1
the	1
study	1
after	1
that.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
re-entered	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
snuff	1
the	1
candles,	1
and,	1
seeing	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
noticed	1
his	1
perturbed	1
face,	1
shook	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
silently	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
snuffing	1
the	1
candles	1
or	1
saying	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
entered.	1
The	1
most	1
solemn	1
mystery	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
continued	1
its	1
course.	1
Evening	1
passed,	1
night	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
suspense	1
and	1
softening	1
of	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
unfathomable	1
did	1
not	1
lessen	1
but	1
increased.	1
No	1
one	1
slept.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
March	1
nights	1
when	1
winter	1
seems	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
resume	1
its	1
sway	1
and	1
scatters	1
its	1
last	1
snows	1
and	1
storms	1
with	1
desperate	1
fury.	1
A	1
relay	1
of	1
horses	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
up	1
the	1
highroad	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
German	1
doctor	1
from	1
Moscow	1
who	1
was	1
expected	1
every	1
moment,	1
and	1
men	1
on	1
horseback	1
with	1
lanterns	1
were	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
crossroads	1
to	1
guide	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
country	1
road	1
with	1
its	1
hollows	1
and	1
snow-covered	1
pools	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
put	1
aside	1
her	1
book:	1
she	1
sat	1
silent,	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
nurse's	1
wrinkled	1
face	1
(every	1
line	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well),	1
on	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
gray	1
hair	1
that	1
escaped	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
kerchief,	1
and	1
the	1
loose	1
skin	1
that	1
hung	1
under	1
her	1
chin.	1
	1
Nurse	1
Savishna,	1
knitting	1
in	1
hand,	1
was	1
telling	1
in	1
low	1
tones,	1
scarcely	1
hearing	1
or	1
understanding	1
her	1
own	1
words,	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times	1
before:	1
how	1
the	1
late	1
princess	1
had	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
Kishenev	1
with	1
only	1
a	1
Moldavian	1
peasant	1
woman	1
to	1
help	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
midwife.	1
	1
"God	1
is	1
merciful,	1
doctors	1
are	1
never	1
needed,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
gust	1
of	1
wind	1
beat	1
violently	1
against	1
the	1
casement	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
double	1
frame	1
had	1
been	1
removed	1
(by	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
prince,	1
one	1
window	1
frame	1
was	1
removed	1
in	1
each	1
room	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
larks	1
returned),	1
and,	1
forcing	1
open	1
a	1
loosely	1
closed	1
latch,	1
set	1
the	1
damask	1
curtain	1
flapping	1
and	1
blew	1
out	1
the	1
candle	1
with	1
its	1
chill,	1
snowy	1
draft.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
shuddered;	1
her	1
nurse,	1
putting	1
down	1
the	1
stocking	1
she	1
was	1
knitting,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
leaning	1
out	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
open	1
casement.	1
The	1
cold	1
wind	1
flapped	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
her	1
kerchief	1
and	1
her	1
loose	1
locks	1
of	1
gray	1
hair.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
my	1
dear,	1
there's	1
someone	1
driving	1
up	1
the	1
avenue!"	1
she	1
said,	1
holding	1
the	1
casement	1
and	1
not	1
closing	1
it.	1
"With	1
lanterns.	1
Most	1
likely	1
the	1
doctor."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God!	1
thank	1
God!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"I	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
meet	1
him,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
Russian."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
threw	1
a	1
shawl	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
newcomer.	1
As	1
she	1
was	1
crossing	1
the	1
anteroom	1
she	1
saw	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
a	1
carriage	1
with	1
lanterns,	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance.	1
She	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
stairs.	1
On	1
a	1
banister	1
post	1
stood	1
a	1
tallow	1
candle	1
which	1
guttered	1
in	1
the	1
draft.	1
On	1
the	1
landing	1
below,	1
Philip,	1
the	1
footman,	1
stood	1
looking	1
scared	1
and	1
holding	1
another	1
candle.	1
Still	1
lower,	1
beyond	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
staircase,	1
one	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
footstep	1
of	1
someone	1
in	1
thick	1
felt	1
boots,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
seemed	1
familiar	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
saying	1
something.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
said	1
the	1
voice.	1
"And	1
Father?"	1
	1
"Gone	1
to	1
bed,"	1
replied	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Demyan	1
the	1
house	1
steward,	1
who	1
was	1
downstairs.	1
	1
Then	1
the	1
voice	1
said	1
something	1
more,	1
Demyan	1
replied,	1
and	1
the	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
felt	1
boots	1
approached	1
the	1
unseen	1
bend	1
of	1
the	1
staircase	1
more	1
rapidly.	1
	1
"It's	1
Andrew!"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"No	1
it	1
can't	1
be,	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
extraordinary,"	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
she	1
thought	1
this,	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
figure	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
in	1
a	1
fur	1
cloak	1
the	1
deep	1
collar	1
of	1
which	1
covered	1
with	1
snow,	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
landing	1
where	1
the	1
footman	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
candle.	1
Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
he,	1
pale,	1
thin,	1
with	1
a	1
changed	1
and	1
strangely	1
softened	1
but	1
agitated	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
embraced	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"You	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
my	1
letter?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
and	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply--	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
received,	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
speak--	1
he	1
turned	1
back,	1
rapidly	1
mounted	1
the	1
stairs	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
hall	1
after	1
him	1
(they	1
had	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
post	1
station),	1
and	1
again	1
embraced	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
strange	1
fate,	1
Masha	1
darling!"	1
And	1
having	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
felt	1
boots,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
apartment.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
lay	1
supported	1
by	1
pillows,	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
cap	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
(the	1
pains	1
had	1
just	1
left	1
her).	1
Strands	1
of	1
her	1
black	1
hair	1
lay	1
round	1
her	1
inflamed	1
and	1
perspiring	1
cheeks,	1
her	1
charming	1
rosy	1
mouth	1
with	1
its	1
downy	1
lip	1
was	1
open	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
smiling	1
joyfully.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
and	1
paused	1
facing	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
lying.	1
Her	1
glittering	1
eyes,	1
filled	1
with	1
childlike	1
fear	1
and	1
excitement,	1
rested	1
on	1
him	1
without	1
changing	1
their	1
expression.	1
"I	1
love	1
you	1
all	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone;	1
why	1
must	1
I	1
suffer	1
so?	1
Help	1
me!"	1
her	1
look	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
She	1
saw	1
her	1
husband,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
appearance	1
before	1
her	1
now.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
forehead.	1
	1
"My	1
darling!"	1
he	1
said--a	1
word	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
her	1
before.	1
"God	1
is	1
merciful...."	1
	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
inquiringly	1
and	1
with	1
childlike	1
reproach.	1
	1
"I	1
expected	1
help	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
get	1
none,	1
none	1
from	1
you	1
either!"	1
said	1
her	1
eyes.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
having	1
come;	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come.	1
His	1
coming	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
sufferings	1
or	1
with	1
their	1
relief.	1
The	1
pangs	1
began	1
again	1
and	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna	1
advised	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
entered.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out	1
and,	1
meeting	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
again	1
joined	1
her.	1
They	1
began	1
talking	1
in	1
whispers,	1
but	1
their	1
talk	1
broke	1
off	1
at	1
every	1
moment.	1
They	1
waited	1
and	1
listened.	1
	1
"Go,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
sat	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
next	1
to	1
hers.	1
A	1
woman	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
became	1
confused	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
He	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
remained	1
so	1
for	1
some	1
minutes.	1
Piteous,	1
helpless,	1
animal	1
moans	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
got	1
up,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
Someone	1
was	1
holding	1
it	1
shut.	1
	1
"You	1
can't	1
come	1
in!	1
You	1
can't!"	1
said	1
a	1
terrified	1
voice	1
from	1
within.	1
	1
He	1
began	1
pacing	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
screaming	1
ceased,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
seconds	1
went	1
by.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
a	1
terrible	1
shriek--it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
hers,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
scream	1
like	1
that--came	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
door;	1
the	1
scream	1
ceased	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
wail	1
of	1
an	1
infant.	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
they	1
taken	1
a	1
baby	1
in	1
there	1
for?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
second.	1
"A	1
baby?	1
What	1
baby...?	1
Why	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
baby	1
there?	1
Or	1
is	1
the	1
baby	1
born?"	1
	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
he	1
realized	1
the	1
joyful	1
significance	1
of	1
that	1
wail;	1
tears	1
choked	1
him,	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill	1
be	1
began	1
to	1
cry,	1
sobbing	1
like	1
a	1
child.	1
The	1
door	1
opened.	1
The	1
doctor	1
with	1
his	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
tucked	1
up,	1
without	1
a	1
coat,	1
pale	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
trembling	1
jaw,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
turned	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
doctor	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
bewildered	1
look	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
A	1
woman	1
rushed	1
out	1
and	1
seeing	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped,	1
hesitating	1
on	1
the	1
threshold.	1
He	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
wife's	1
room.	1
She	1
was	1
lying	1
dead,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
before	1
and,	1
despite	1
the	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
pallor	1
of	1
the	1
cheeks,	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
was	1
on	1
her	1
charming	1
childlike	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
upper	1
lip	1
covered	1
with	1
tiny	1
black	1
hair.	1
	1
"I	1
love	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone;	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
me?"--said	1
her	1
charming,	1
pathetic,	1
dead	1
face.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
something	1
red	1
and	1
tiny	1
gave	1
a	1
grunt	1
and	1
squealed	1
in	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna's	1
trembling	1
white	1
hands.	1
	1
Two	1
hours	1
later	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
stepping	1
softly,	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
father's	1
room.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
already	1
knew	1
everything.	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
opened	1
his	1
rough	1
old	1
arms	1
closed	1
like	1
a	1
vise	1
round	1
his	1
son's	1
neck,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
sob	1
like	1
a	1
child.	1
	1
Three	1
days	1
later	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
buried,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
coffin	1
stood,	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
farewell	1
kiss.	1
And	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
face,	1
though	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes.	1
"Ah,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
me?"	1
it	1
still	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
gave	1
way	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
guilty	1
of	1
a	1
sin	1
he	1
could	1
neither	1
remedy	1
nor	1
forget.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
weep.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
too	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
waxen	1
little	1
hands	1
that	1
lay	1
quietly	1
crossed	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
her	1
breast,	1
and	1
to	1
him,	1
too,	1
her	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"Ah,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
why?"	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
turned	1
angrily	1
away.	1
	1
Another	1
five	1
days	1
passed,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
young	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Andreevich	1
was	1
baptized.	1
The	1
wet	1
nurse	1
supported	1
the	1
coverlet	1
with	1
her	1
chin,	1
while	1
the	1
priest	1
with	1
a	1
goose	1
feather	1
anointed	1
the	1
boy's	1
little	1
red	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
soles	1
and	1
palms.	1
	1
His	1
grandfather,	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
godfather,	1
trembling	1
and	1
afraid	1
of	1
dropping	1
him,	1
carried	1
the	1
infant	1
round	1
the	1
battered	1
tin	1
font	1
and	1
handed	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
godmother,	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sat	1
in	1
another	1
room,	1
faint	1
with	1
fear	1
lest	1
the	1
baby	1
should	1
be	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
font,	1
and	1
awaited	1
the	1
termination	1
of	1
the	1
ceremony.	1
He	1
looked	1
up	1
joyfully	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
when	1
the	1
nurse	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
nodded	1
approval	1
when	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
wax	1
with	1
the	1
baby's	1
hair	1
had	1
not	1
sunk	1
in	1
the	1
font	1
but	1
had	1
floated.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Rostov's	1
share	1
in	1
Dolokhov's	1
duel	1
with	1
Bezukhov	1
was	1
hushed	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
degraded	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
as	1
he	1
expected	1
he	1
was	1
appointed	1
an	1
adjutant	1
to	1
the	1
governor	1
general	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
As	1
a	1
result	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
but	1
was	1
kept	1
all	1
summer	1
in	1
Moscow	1
by	1
his	1
new	1
duties.	1
Dolokhov	1
recovered,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
became	1
very	1
friendly	1
with	1
him	1
during	1
his	1
convalescence.	1
Dolokhov	1
lay	1
ill	1
at	1
his	1
mother's	1
who	1
loved	1
him	1
passionately	1
and	1
tenderly,	1
and	1
old	1
Mary	1
Ivanovna,	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
fond	1
of	1
Rostov	1
for	1
his	1
friendship	1
to	1
her	1
Fedya,	1
often	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
her	1
son.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Count,"	1
she	1
would	1
say,	1
"he	1
is	1
too	1
noble	1
and	1
pure-souled	1
for	1
our	1
present,	1
depraved	1
world.	1
No	1
one	1
now	1
loves	1
virtue;	1
it	1
seems	1
like	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
everyone.	1
Now	1
tell	1
me,	1
Count,	1
was	1
it	1
right,	1
was	1
it	1
honorable,	1
of	1
Bezukhov?	1
And	1
Fedya,	1
with	1
his	1
noble	1
spirit,	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
never	1
says	1
a	1
word	1
against	1
him.	1
Those	1
pranks	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
when	1
they	1
played	1
some	1
tricks	1
on	1
a	1
policeman,	1
didn't	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
together?	1
And	1
there!	1
Bezukhov	1
got	1
off	1
scotfree,	1
while	1
Fedya	1
had	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
whole	1
burden	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Fancy	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
through!	1
It's	1
true	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
reinstated,	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
they	1
fail	1
to	1
do	1
that?	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
such	1
gallant	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
fatherland	1
out	1
there	1
as	1
he.	1
And	1
now--this	1
duel!	1
Have	1
these	1
people	1
no	1
feeling,	1
or	1
honor?	1
Knowing	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
only	1
son,	1
to	1
challenge	1
him	1
and	1
shoot	1
so	1
straight!	1
It's	1
well	1
God	1
had	1
mercy	1
on	1
us.	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
for?	1
Who	1
doesn't	1
have	1
intrigues	1
nowadays?	1
Why,	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
jealous,	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
things	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
shown	1
it	1
sooner,	1
but	1
he	1
lets	1
it	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
months.	1
And	1
then	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
out,	1
reckoning	1
on	1
Fedya	1
not	1
fighting	1
because	1
he	1
owed	1
him	1
money!	1
What	1
baseness!	1
What	1
meanness!	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
understand	1
Fedya,	1
my	1
dear	1
count;	1
that,	1
believe	1
me,	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
you.	1
Few	1
people	1
do	1
understand	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
lofty,	1
heavenly	1
soul!"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
himself	1
during	1
his	1
convalescence	1
spoke	1
to	1
Rostov	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
expected	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
people	1
consider	1
me	1
a	1
bad	1
man!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Let	1
them!	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
a	1
straw	1
about	1
anyone	1
but	1
those	1
I	1
love;	1
but	1
those	1
I	1
love,	1
I	1
love	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
I'd	1
throttle	1
if	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
my	1
way.	1
I	1
have	1
an	1
adored,	1
a	1
priceless	1
mother,	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
friends--you	1
among	1
them--and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
I	1
only	1
care	1
about	1
them	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
harmful	1
or	1
useful.	1
And	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
harmful,	1
especially	1
the	1
women.	1
Yes,	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"I	1
have	1
met	1
loving,	1
noble,	1
high-minded	1
men,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
met	1
any	1
women--countesses	1
or	1
cooks--who	1
were	1
not	1
venal.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
met	1
that	1
divine	1
purity	1
and	1
devotion	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
in	1
women.	1
If	1
I	1
found	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
I'd	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
her!	1
But	1
those!..."	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
contempt.	1
"And	1
believe	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
still	1
value	1
my	1
life	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
still	1
hope	1
to	1
meet	1
such	1
a	1
divine	1
creature,	1
who	1
will	1
regenerate,	1
purify,	1
and	1
elevate	1
me.	1
But	1
you	1
don't	1
understand	1
it."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
quite	1
understand,"	1
answered	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
new	1
friend's	1
influence.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
autumn	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
Early	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
Denisov	1
also	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
stayed	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
first	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
1806,	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
spent	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
happiest,	1
merriest	1
times	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
family.	1
Nicholas	1
brought	1
many	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
his	1
parents'	1
house.	1
Vera	1
was	1
a	1
handsome	1
girl	1
of	1
twenty;	1
Sonya	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
sixteen	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
an	1
opening	1
flower;	1
Natasha,	1
half	1
grown	1
up	1
and	1
half	1
child,	1
was	1
now	1
childishly	1
amusing,	1
now	1
girlishly	1
enchanting.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
there	1
prevailed	1
an	1
amorous	1
atmosphere	1
characteristic	1
of	1
homes	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
young	1
and	1
very	1
charming	1
girls.	1
Every	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house--seeing	1
those	1
impressionable,	1
smiling	1
young	1
faces	1
(smiling	1
probably	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
happiness),	1
feeling	1
the	1
eager	1
bustle	1
around	1
him,	1
and	1
hearing	1
the	1
fitful	1
bursts	1
of	1
song	1
and	1
music	1
and	1
the	1
inconsequent	1
but	1
friendly	1
prattle	1
of	1
young	1
girls	1
ready	1
for	1
anything	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
hope--experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling;	1
sharing	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
folk	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
household	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
an	1
expectation	1
of	1
happiness.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
introduced	1
by	1
Rostov	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
was	1
Dolokhov,	1
whom	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
liked	1
except	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
almost	1
quarreled	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
about	1
him.	1
She	1
insisted	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
duel	1
with	1
Bezukhov,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
wrong,	1
and	1
further	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
disagreeable	1
and	1
unnatural.	1
	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
understand,"	1
she	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
resolute	1
self-will,	1
"he	1
is	1
wicked	1
and	1
heartless.	1
There	1
now,	1
I	1
like	1
your	1
Denisov	1
though	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
rake	1
and	1
all	1
that,	1
still	1
I	1
like	1
him;	1
so	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
do	1
understand.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
put	1
it...	1
with	1
this	1
one	1
everything	1
is	1
calculated,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
that.	1
But	1
Denisov..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Denisov	1
is	1
quite	1
different,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas,	1
implying	1
that	1
even	1
Denisov	1
was	1
nothing	1
compared	1
to	1
Dolokhov--"you	1
must	1
understand	1
what	1
a	1
soul	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
Dolokhov,	1
you	1
should	1
see	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
mother.	1
What	1
a	1
heart!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
about	1
that,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
uncomfortable	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Sonya?"	1
	1
"What	1
nonsense..."	1
	1
"I'm	1
certain	1
of	1
it;	1
you'll	1
see."	1
	1
Natasha's	1
prediction	1
proved	1
true.	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
usually	1
care	1
for	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
ladies,	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
often	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
whose	1
sake	1
he	1
came	1
(though	1
no	1
one	1
spoke	1
of	1
it)	1
was	1
soon	1
settled.	1
He	1
came	1
because	1
of	1
Sonya.	1
And	1
Sonya,	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
say	1
so,	1
knew	1
it	1
and	1
blushed	1
scarlet	1
every	1
time	1
Dolokhov	1
appeared.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
often	1
dined	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs',	1
never	1
missed	1
a	1
performance	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
present,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Iogel's	1
balls	1
for	1
young	1
people	1
which	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
always	1
attended.	1
He	1
was	1
pointedly	1
attentive	1
to	1
Sonya	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
could	1
she	1
not	1
bear	1
his	1
glances	1
without	1
coloring,	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
and	1
Natasha	1
blushed	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
his	1
looks.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
this	1
strange,	1
strong	1
man	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
irresistible	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
dark,	1
graceful	1
girl	1
who	1
loved	1
another.	1
	1
Rostov	1
noticed	1
something	1
new	1
in	1
Dolokhov's	1
relations	1
with	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
explain	1
to	1
himself	1
what	1
these	1
new	1
relations	1
were.	1
"They're	1
always	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
someone,"	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
was	1
less	1
frequently	1
at	1
home.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
autumn	1
of	1
1806	1
everybody	1
had	1
again	1
begun	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
even	1
greater	1
warmth	1
than	1
the	1
year	1
before.	1
Orders	1
were	1
given	1
to	1
raise	1
recruits,	1
ten	1
men	1
in	1
every	1
thousand	1
for	1
the	1
regular	1
army,	1
and	1
besides	1
this,	1
nine	1
men	1
in	1
every	1
thousand	1
for	1
the	1
militia.	1
Everywhere	1
Bonaparte	1
was	1
anathematized	1
and	1
in	1
Moscow	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
coming	1
war	1
was	1
talked	1
of.	1
For	1
the	1
Rostov	1
family	1
the	1
whole	1
interest	1
of	1
these	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
remaining	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
only	1
awaited	1
the	1
termination	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
furlough	1
after	1
Christmas	1
to	1
return	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
their	1
regiment.	1
His	1
approaching	1
departure	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
his	1
amusing	1
himself,	1
but	1
rather	1
gave	1
zest	1
to	1
his	1
pleasures.	1
He	1
spent	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
away	1
from	1
home,	1
at	1
dinners,	1
parties,	1
and	1
balls.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
Christmas	1
Nicholas	1
dined	1
at	1
home,	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
had	1
rarely	1
done	1
of	1
late.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
grand	1
farewell	1
dinner,	1
as	1
he	1
and	1
Denisov	1
were	1
leaving	1
to	1
join	1
their	1
regiment	1
after	1
Epiphany.	1
About	1
twenty	1
people	1
were	1
present,	1
including	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
Denisov.	1
	1
Never	1
had	1
love	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
amorous	1
atmosphere	1
made	1
itself	1
so	1
strongly	1
felt	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
holiday	1
time.	1
"Seize	1
the	1
moments	1
of	1
happiness,	1
love	1
and	1
be	1
loved!	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
reality	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
all	1
else	1
is	1
folly.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
we	1
are	1
interested	1
in	1
here,"	1
said	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
place.	1
	1
Nicholas,	1
having	1
as	1
usual	1
exhausted	1
two	1
pairs	1
of	1
horses,	1
without	1
visiting	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
invited,	1
returned	1
home	1
just	1
before	1
dinner.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
he	1
noticed	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
tension	1
of	1
the	1
amorous	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
also	1
noticed	1
a	1
curious	1
embarrassment	1
among	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
present.	1
Sonya,	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
were	1
especially	1
disturbed,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
lesser	1
degree	1
Natasha.	1
Nicholas	1
understood	1
that	1
something	1
must	1
have	1
happened	1
between	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
before	1
dinner,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
kindly	1
sensitiveness	1
natural	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
very	1
gentle	1
and	1
wary	1
with	1
them	1
both	1
at	1
dinner.	1
On	1
that	1
same	1
evening	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
balls	1
that	1
Iogel	1
(the	1
dancing	1
master)	1
gave	1
for	1
his	1
pupils	1
during	1
the	1
holidays.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
will	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
Iogel's?	1
Please	1
do!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"He	1
asked	1
you,	1
and	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich	1
*	1
is	1
also	1
going."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Where	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
go	1
at	1
the	1
countess'	1
command!"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
had	1
jocularly	1
assumed	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
knight.	1
"I'm	1
even	1
weady	1
to	1
dance	1
the	1
pas	1
de	1
chale."	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
have	1
time,"	1
answered	1
Nicholas.	1
"But	1
I	1
promised	1
the	1
Arkharovs;	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
party."	1
	1
"And	1
you?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Dolokhov,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
put.	1
	1
"Perhaps,"	1
coldly	1
and	1
angrily	1
replied	1
Dolokhov,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Sonya,	1
and,	1
scowling,	1
he	1
gave	1
Nicholas	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
look	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
Pierre	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
dinner.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
something	1
up,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
further	1
confirmed	1
in	1
this	1
conclusion	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
left	1
immediately	1
after	1
dinner.	1
He	1
called	1
Natasha	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
running	1
out	1
to	1
him.	1
"I	1
told	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
believe	1
it,"	1
she	1
said	1
triumphantly.	1
"He	1
has	1
proposed	1
to	1
Sonya!"	1
	1
Little	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
occupied	1
himself	1
with	1
Sonya	1
of	1
late,	1
something	1
seemed	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
within	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
news.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
a	1
suitable	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
respects	1
a	1
brilliant	1
match	1
for	1
the	1
dowerless,	1
orphan	1
girl.	1
From	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
and	1
of	1
society	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
refuse	1
him.	1
And	1
therefore	1
Nicholas'	1
first	1
feeling	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
news	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
anger	1
with	1
Sonya....	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
say,	1
"That's	1
capital;	1
of	1
course	1
she'll	1
forget	1
her	1
childish	1
promises	1
and	1
accept	1
the	1
offer,"	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
Natasha	1
began	1
again.	1
	1
"And	1
fancy!	1
she	1
refused	1
him	1
quite	1
definitely!"	1
adding,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"she	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
loved	1
another."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
Sonya	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
otherwise!"	1
thought	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Much	1
as	1
Mamma	1
pressed	1
her,	1
she	1
refused,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
she	1
won't	1
change	1
once	1
she	1
has	1
said..."	1
	1
"And	1
Mamma	1
pressed	1
her!"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Nicholas--don't	1
be	1
angry--but	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
marry	1
her.	1
I	1
know,	1
heaven	1
knows	1
how,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
you	1
won't	1
marry	1
her."	1
	1
"Now	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
that	1
at	1
all!"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"But	1
I	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
her.	1
What	1
a	1
darling	1
Sonya	1
is!"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
she	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
darling!	1
I'll	1
send	1
her	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
And	1
Natasha	1
kissed	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
ran	1
away.	1
	1
A	1
minute	1
later	1
Sonya	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
frightened,	1
guilty,	1
and	1
scared	1
look.	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
his	1
return	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
talked	1
alone	1
and	1
about	1
their	1
love.	1
	1
"Sophie,"	1
he	1
began,	1
timidly	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
boldly,	1
"if	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
refuse	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
brilliant	1
and	1
advantageous	1
match	1
but	1
a	1
splendid,	1
noble	1
fellow...	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
friend..."	1
	1
Sonya	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
refused,"	1
she	1
said	1
hurriedly.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
are	1
refusing	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
I..."	1
	1
Sonya	1
again	1
interrupted.	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
imploring,	1
frightened	1
look.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
don't	1
tell	1
me	1
that!"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
must.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
arrogant	1
of	1
me,	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
is	1
best	1
to	1
say	1
it.	1
If	1
you	1
refuse	1
him	1
on	1
my	1
account,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
anyone	1
else...."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
blushing.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
and	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
again,	1
though	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
have	1
I	1
such	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
friendship,	1
confidence,	1
and	1
love	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
you.	1
Then	1
I	1
am	1
young.	1
Mamma	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
it.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
promise.	1
And	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
consider	1
Dolokhov's	1
offer,"	1
he	1
said,	1
articulating	1
his	1
friend's	1
name	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"Don't	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
me!	1
I	1
want	1
nothing.	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
brother	1
and	1
always	1
shall,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
nothing	1
more."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
an	1
angel:	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
misleading	1
you."	1
	1
And	1
Nicholas	1
again	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
Iogel's	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
enjoyable	1
balls	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
So	1
said	1
the	1
mothers	1
as	1
they	1
watched	1
their	1
young	1
people	1
executing	1
their	1
newly	1
learned	1
steps,	1
and	1
so	1
said	1
the	1
youths	1
and	1
maidens	1
themselves	1
as	1
they	1
danced	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
drop,	1
and	1
so	1
said	1
the	1
grown-up	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
these	1
balls	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
condescension	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
most	1
enjoyable.	1
That	1
year	1
two	1
marriages	1
had	1
come	1
of	1
these	1
balls.	1
The	1
two	1
pretty	1
young	1
Princesses	1
Gorchakov	1
met	1
suitors	1
there	1
and	1
were	1
married	1
and	1
so	1
further	1
increased	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
these	1
dances.	1
What	1
distinguished	1
them	1
from	1
others	1
was	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
host	1
or	1
hostess	1
and	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
good-natured	1
Iogel,	1
flying	1
about	1
like	1
a	1
feather	1
and	1
bowing	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
his	1
art,	1
as	1
he	1
collected	1
the	1
tickets	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
visitors.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
only	1
those	1
came	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
dance	1
and	1
amuse	1
themselves	1
as	1
girls	1
of	1
thirteen	1
and	1
fourteen	1
do	1
who	1
are	1
wearing	1
long	1
dresses	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
With	1
scarcely	1
any	1
exceptions	1
they	1
all	1
were,	1
or	1
seemed	1
to	1
be,	1
pretty--so	1
rapturous	1
were	1
their	1
smiles	1
and	1
so	1
sparkling	1
their	1
eyes.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
pupils,	1
of	1
whom	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
graceful,	1
was	1
first,	1
even	1
danced	1
the	1
pas	1
de	1
chale,	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
last	1
ball	1
only	1
the	1
ecossaise,	1
the	1
anglaise,	1
and	1
the	1
mazurka,	1
which	1
was	1
just	1
coming	1
into	1
fashion,	1
were	1
danced.	1
Iogel	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
ballroom	1
in	1
Bezukhov's	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
ball,	1
as	1
everyone	1
said,	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
success.	1
There	1
were	1
many	1
pretty	1
girls	1
and	1
the	1
Rostov	1
girls	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
prettiest.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
particularly	1
happy	1
and	1
gay.	1
That	1
evening,	1
proud	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
proposal,	1
her	1
refusal,	1
and	1
her	1
explanation	1
with	1
Nicholas,	1
Sonya	1
twirled	1
about	1
before	1
she	1
left	1
home	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
maid	1
could	1
hardly	1
get	1
her	1
hair	1
plaited,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
transparently	1
radiant	1
with	1
impulsive	1
joy.	1
	1
Natasha	1
no	1
less	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
first	1
long	1
dress	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
at	1
a	1
real	1
ball	1
was	1
even	1
happier.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
dressed	1
in	1
white	1
muslin	1
with	1
pink	1
ribbons.	1
	1
Natasha	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
anyone	1
in	1
particular,	1
but	1
with	1
everyone.	1
Whatever	1
person	1
she	1
happened	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
for	1
that	1
moment.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
delightful	1
it	1
is!"	1
she	1
kept	1
saying,	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
Sonya.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Denisov	1
were	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
looking	1
with	1
kindly	1
patronage	1
at	1
the	1
dancers.	1
	1
"How	1
sweet	1
she	1
is--she	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
weal	1
beauty!"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Who?"	1
	1
"Countess	1
Natasha,"	1
answered	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
she	1
dances!	1
What	1
gwace!"	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about?"	1
	1
"About	1
your	1
sister,"	1
ejaculated	1
Denisov	1
testily.	1
	1
Rostov	1
smiled.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
count,	1
you	1
were	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
best	1
pupils--you	1
must	1
dance,"	1
said	1
little	1
Iogel	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
"Look	1
how	1
many	1
charming	1
young	1
ladies-"	1
He	1
turned	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
request	1
to	1
Denisov	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
former	1
pupil	1
of	1
his.	1
	1
"No,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I'll	1
be	1
a	1
wallflower,"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
wecollect	1
what	1
bad	1
use	1
I	1
made	1
of	1
your	1
lessons?"	1
	1
	1
"Oh	1
no!"	1
said	1
Iogel,	1
hastening	1
to	1
reassure	1
him.	1
"You	1
were	1
only	1
inattentive,	1
but	1
you	1
had	1
talent--oh	1
yes,	1
you	1
had	1
talent!"	1
	1
The	1
band	1
struck	1
up	1
the	1
newly	1
introduced	1
mazurka.	1
Nicholas	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
Iogel	1
and	1
asked	1
Sonya	1
to	1
dance.	1
Denisov	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
old	1
ladies	1
and,	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
saber	1
and	1
beating	1
time	1
with	1
his	1
foot,	1
told	1
them	1
something	1
funny	1
and	1
kept	1
them	1
amused,	1
while	1
he	1
watched	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
dancing,	1
Iogel	1
with	1
Natasha,	1
his	1
pride	1
and	1
his	1
best	1
pupil,	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
couple.	1
Noiselessly,	1
skillfully	1
stepping	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
feet	1
in	1
low	1
shoes,	1
Iogel	1
flew	1
first	1
across	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
Natasha,	1
who,	1
though	1
shy,	1
went	1
on	1
carefully	1
executing	1
her	1
steps.	1
Denisov	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
and	1
beat	1
time	1
with	1
his	1
saber	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
clearly	1
indicated	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
dancing	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
and	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
figure	1
he	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Rostov	1
who	1
was	1
passing:	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
thing,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"What	1
sort	1
of	1
Polish	1
mazuwka	1
is	1
this?	1
But	1
she	1
does	1
dance	1
splendidly."	1
	1
Knowing	1
that	1
Denisov	1
had	1
a	1
reputation	1
even	1
in	1
Poland	1
for	1
the	1
masterly	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
danced	1
the	1
mazurka,	1
Nicholas	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
Natasha:	1
	1
"Go	1
and	1
choose	1
Denisov.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
dancer,	1
a	1
wonder!"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
When	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
turn	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
partner,	1
she	1
rose	1
and,	1
tripping	1
rapidly	1
across	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
shoes	1
trimmed	1
with	1
bows,	1
ran	1
timidly	1
to	1
the	1
corner	1
where	1
Denisov	1
sat.	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
everybody	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
waiting.	1
Nicholas	1
saw	1
that	1
Denisov	1
was	1
refusing	1
though	1
he	1
smiled	1
delightedly.	1
He	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
"Please,	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich,"	1
Natasha	1
was	1
saying,	1
"do	1
come!"	1
	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
let	1
me	1
off,	1
Countess,"	1
Denisov	1
replied.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
Vaska,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"They	1
coax	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
Vaska	1
the	1
cat!"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
jokingly.	1
	1
"I'll	1
sing	1
for	1
you	1
a	1
whole	1
evening,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
faiwy!	1
She	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
with	1
me!"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
he	1
unhooked	1
his	1
saber.	1
He	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
chairs,	1
clasped	1
his	1
partner's	1
hand	1
firmly,	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
advanced	1
his	1
foot,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
beat.	1
Only	1
on	1
horse	1
back	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mazurka	1
was	1
Denisov's	1
short	1
stature	1
not	1
noticeable	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
the	1
fine	1
fellow	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be.	1
At	1
the	1
right	1
beat	1
of	1
the	1
music	1
he	1
looked	1
sideways	1
at	1
his	1
partner	1
with	1
a	1
merry	1
and	1
triumphant	1
air,	1
suddenly	1
stamped	1
with	1
one	1
foot,	1
bounded	1
from	1
the	1
floor	1
like	1
a	1
ball,	1
and	1
flew	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
taking	1
his	1
partner	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
glided	1
silently	1
on	1
one	1
foot	1
half	1
across	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
seeming	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
chairs	1
was	1
dashing	1
straight	1
at	1
them,	1
when	1
suddenly,	1
clinking	1
his	1
spurs	1
and	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
legs,	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
on	1
his	1
heels,	1
stood	1
so	1
a	1
second,	1
stamped	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
clanking	1
his	1
spurs,	1
whirled	1
rapidly	1
round,	1
and,	1
striking	1
his	1
left	1
heel	1
against	1
his	1
right,	1
flew	1
round	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
circle.	1
Natasha	1
guessed	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
abandoning	1
herself	1
to	1
him	1
followed	1
his	1
lead	1
hardly	1
knowing	1
how.	1
First	1
he	1
spun	1
her	1
round,	1
holding	1
her	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
left,	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
then	1
falling	1
on	1
one	1
knee	1
he	1
twirled	1
her	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
again	1
jumping	1
up,	1
dashed	1
so	1
impetuously	1
forward	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
rush	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
suite	1
of	1
rooms	1
without	1
drawing	1
breath,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
and	1
performed	1
some	1
new	1
and	1
unexpected	1
steps.	1
When	1
at	1
last,	1
smartly	1
whirling	1
his	1
partner	1
round	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
chair,	1
he	1
drew	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
click	1
of	1
his	1
spurs	1
and	1
bowed	1
to	1
her,	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
curtsy.	1
She	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
amazement,	1
smiling	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
this	1
mean?"	1
she	1
brought	1
out.	1
	1
Although	1
Iogel	1
did	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
real	1
mazurka,	1
everyone	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
Denisov's	1
skill,	1
he	1
was	1
asked	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
as	1
a	1
partner,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
began	1
smilingly	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
Poland	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
days.	1
Denisov,	1
flushed	1
after	1
the	1
mazurka	1
and	1
mopping	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
handkerchief,	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
Natasha	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
For	1
two	1
days	1
after	1
that	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
Dolokhov	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
or	1
at	1
Dolokhov's	1
home:	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
received	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
him:	1
	1
As	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
your	1
house	1
again	1
for	1
reasons	1
you	1
know	1
of,	1
and	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
rejoin	1
my	1
regiment,	1
I	1
am	1
giving	1
a	1
farewell	1
supper	1
tonight	1
to	1
my	1
friends--come	1
to	1
the	1
English	1
Hotel.	1
	1
About	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
English	1
Hotel	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1
theater,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
Denisov.	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
shown	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
room,	1
which	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
taken	1
for	1
that	1
evening.	1
Some	1
twenty	1
men	1
were	1
gathered	1
round	1
a	1
table	1
at	1
which	1
Dolokhov	1
sat	1
between	1
two	1
candles.	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
paper	1
money,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
keeping	1
the	1
bank.	1
Rostov	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
his	1
proposal	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
refusal	1
and	1
felt	1
uncomfortable	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
meet.	1
	1
Dolokhov's	1
clear,	1
cold	1
glance	1
met	1
Rostov	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
door,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
expected	1
him.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
since	1
we	1
met,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Thanks	1
for	1
coming.	1
I'll	1
just	1
finish	1
dealing,	1
and	1
then	1
Ilyushka	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
his	1
chorus."	1
	1
"I	1
called	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
at	1
your	1
house,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
reddening.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
punt,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Rostov	1
recalled	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
strange	1
conversation	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
had	1
with	1
Dolokhov.	1
"None	1
but	1
fools	1
trust	1
to	1
luck	1
in	1
play,"	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
then	1
said.	1
	1
"Or	1
are	1
you	1
afraid	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
me?"	1
Dolokhov	1
now	1
asked	1
as	1
if	1
guessing	1
Rostov's	1
thought.	1
	1
Beneath	1
his	1
smile	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
mood	1
he	1
had	1
shown	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
dinner	1
and	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
when	1
as	1
if	1
tired	1
of	1
everyday	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
it	1
by	1
some	1
strange,	1
and	1
usually	1
cruel,	1
action.	1
	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease.	1
He	1
tried,	1
but	1
failed,	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
joke	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
Dolokhov's	1
words.	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
anything,	1
Dolokhov,	1
looking	1
straight	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
said	1
slowly	1
and	1
deliberately	1
so	1
that	1
everyone	1
could	1
hear:	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
talk	1
about	1
cards...	1
'He's	1
a	1
fool	1
who	1
trusts	1
to	1
luck,	1
one	1
should	1
make	1
certain,'	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
try."	1
	1
"To	1
try	1
his	1
luck	1
or	1
the	1
certainty?"	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
himself.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you'd	1
better	1
not	1
play,"	1
Dolokhov	1
added,	1
and	1
springing	1
a	1
new	1
pack	1
of	1
cards	1
said:	1
"Bank,	1
gentlemen!"	1
	1
Moving	1
the	1
money	1
forward	1
he	1
prepared	1
to	1
deal.	1
Rostov	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
did	1
not	1
play.	1
Dolokhov	1
kept	1
glancing	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
play?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
And	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
card,	1
putting	1
a	1
small	1
stake	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
play.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
money	1
with	1
me,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"I'll	1
trust	1
you."	1
	1
Rostov	1
staked	1
five	1
rubles	1
on	1
a	1
card	1
and	1
lost,	1
staked	1
again,	1
and	1
again	1
lost.	1
Dolokhov	1
"killed,"	1
that	1
is,	1
beat,	1
ten	1
cards	1
of	1
Rostov's	1
running.	1
	1
"Gentlemen,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
dealt	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
"Please	1
place	1
your	1
money	1
on	1
the	1
cards	1
or	1
I	1
may	1
get	1
muddled	1
in	1
the	1
reckoning."	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
players	1
said	1
he	1
hoped	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
trusted.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
might,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
getting	1
the	1
accounts	1
mixed.	1
So	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
money	1
on	1
your	1
cards,"	1
replied	1
Dolokhov.	1
"Don't	1
stint	1
yourself,	1
we'll	1
settle	1
afterwards,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
The	1
game	1
continued;	1
a	1
waiter	1
kept	1
handing	1
round	1
champagne.	1
	1
All	1
Rostov's	1
cards	1
were	1
beaten	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
eight	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
scored	1
up	1
against	1
him.	1
He	1
wrote	1
"800	1
rubles"	1
on	1
a	1
card,	1
but	1
while	1
the	1
waiter	1
filled	1
his	1
glass	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
altered	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
stake	1
of	1
twenty	1
rubles.	1
	1
"Leave	1
it,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
even	1
looking	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
"you'll	1
win	1
it	1
back	1
all	1
the	1
sooner.	1
I	1
lose	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
but	1
win	1
from	1
you.	1
Or	1
are	1
you	1
afraid	1
of	1
me?"	1
he	1
asked	1
again.	1
	1
Rostov	1
submitted.	1
He	1
let	1
the	1
eight	1
hundred	1
remain	1
and	1
laid	1
down	1
a	1
seven	1
of	1
hearts	1
with	1
a	1
torn	1
corner,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
floor.	1
He	1
well	1
remembered	1
that	1
seven	1
afterwards.	1
He	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
seven	1
of	1
hearts,	1
on	1
which	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
bit	1
of	1
chalk	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
"800	1
rubles"	1
in	1
clear	1
upright	1
figures;	1
he	1
emptied	1
the	1
glass	1
of	1
warm	1
champagne	1
that	1
was	1
handed	1
him,	1
smiled	1
at	1
Dolokhov's	1
words,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart,	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
seven	1
to	1
turn	1
up,	1
gazed	1
at	1
Dolokhov's	1
hands	1
which	1
held	1
the	1
pack.	1
Much	1
depended	1
on	1
Rostov's	1
winning	1
or	1
losing	1
on	1
that	1
seven	1
of	1
hearts.	1
On	1
the	1
previous	1
Sunday	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
had	1
given	1
his	1
son	1
two	1
thousand	1
rubles,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
always	1
disliked	1
speaking	1
of	1
money	1
difficulties	1
had	1
told	1
Nicholas	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
till	1
May,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
economical	1
this	1
time.	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
anything	1
more	1
till	1
the	1
spring.	1
Now	1
only	1
twelve	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
that	1
money,	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
seven	1
of	1
hearts	1
meant	1
for	1
him	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
sixteen	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
but	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
going	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
word.	1
With	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart	1
he	1
watched	1
Dolokhov's	1
hands	1
and	1
thought,	1
"Now	1
then,	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
this	1
card	1
and	1
I'll	1
take	1
my	1
cap	1
and	1
drive	1
home	1
to	1
supper	1
with	1
Denisov,	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
will	1
certainly	1
never	1
touch	1
a	1
card	1
again."	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
his	1
home	1
life,	1
jokes	1
with	1
Petya,	1
talks	1
with	1
Sonya,	1
duets	1
with	1
Natasha,	1
piquet	1
with	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
even	1
his	1
comfortable	1
bed	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Povarskaya	1
rose	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
such	1
vividness,	1
clearness,	1
and	1
charm	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
a	1
lost	1
and	1
unappreciated	1
bliss,	1
long	1
past.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
that	1
a	1
stupid	1
chance,	1
letting	1
the	1
seven	1
be	1
dealt	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
might	1
deprive	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
happiness,	1
newly	1
appreciated	1
and	1
newly	1
illumined,	1
and	1
plunge	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
unknown	1
and	1
undefined	1
misery.	1
That	1
could	1
not	1
be,	1
yet	1
he	1
awaited	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
hands.	1
Those	1
broad,	1
reddish	1
hands,	1
with	1
hairy	1
wrists	1
visible	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
shirt	1
cuffs,	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
pack	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
glass	1
and	1
a	1
pipe	1
that	1
were	1
handed	1
him.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
me?"	1
repeated	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
good	1
story	1
he	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
cards,	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
began	1
deliberately	1
with	1
a	1
smile:	1
	1
"Yes,	1
gentlemen,	1
I've	1
been	1
told	1
there's	1
a	1
rumor	1
going	1
about	1
Moscow	1
that	1
I'm	1
a	1
sharper,	1
so	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
careful."	1
	1
"Come	1
now,	1
deal!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
those	1
Moscow	1
gossips!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
cards	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Aah!"	1
Rostov	1
almost	1
screamed	1
lifting	1
both	1
hands	1
to	1
his	1
head.	1
The	1
seven	1
he	1
needed	1
was	1
lying	1
uppermost,	1
the	1
first	1
card	1
in	1
the	1
pack.	1
He	1
had	1
lost	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
pay.	1
	1
"Still,	1
don't	1
ruin	1
yourself!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
a	1
side	1
glance	1
at	1
Rostov	1
as	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
deal.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
An	1
hour	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
later	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
players	1
were	1
but	1
little	1
interested	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
play.	1
	1
The	1
whole	1
interest	1
was	1
concentrated	1
on	1
Rostov.	1
Instead	1
of	1
sixteen	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
column	1
of	1
figures	1
scored	1
against	1
him,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
reckoned	1
up	1
to	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
but	1
that	1
now,	1
as	1
he	1
vaguely	1
supposed,	1
must	1
have	1
risen	1
to	1
fifteen	1
thousand.	1
In	1
reality	1
it	1
already	1
exceeded	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
rubles.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
listening	1
to	1
stories	1
or	1
telling	1
them,	1
but	1
followed	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
Rostov's	1
hands	1
and	1
occasionally	1
ran	1
his	1
eyes	1
over	1
the	1
score	1
against	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
play	1
until	1
that	1
score	1
reached	1
forty-three	1
thousand.	1
He	1
had	1
fixed	1
on	1
that	1
number	1
because	1
forty-three	1
was	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
his	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
joint	1
ages.	1
Rostov,	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
both	1
hands,	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
which	1
was	1
scrawled	1
over	1
with	1
figures,	1
wet	1
with	1
spilled	1
wine,	1
and	1
littered	1
with	1
cards.	1
One	1
tormenting	1
impression	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
him:	1
that	1
those	1
broad-	1
boned	1
reddish	1
hands	1
with	1
hairy	1
wrists	1
visible	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
shirt	1
sleeves,	1
those	1
hands	1
which	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
hated,	1
held	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
power.	1
	1
"Six	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
ace,	1
a	1
corner,	1
a	1
nine...	1
winning	1
it	1
back's	1
impossible...	1
Oh,	1
how	1
pleasant	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
home!...	1
The	1
knave,	1
double	1
or	1
quits...	1
it	1
can't	1
be!...	1
And	1
why	1
is	1
he	1
doing	1
this	1
to	1
me?"	1
Rostov	1
pondered.	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
staked	1
a	1
large	1
sum,	1
but	1
Dolokhov	1
refused	1
to	1
accept	1
it	1
and	1
fixed	1
the	1
stake	1
himself.	1
Nicholas	1
submitted	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield	1
at	1
the	1
bridge	1
over	1
the	1
Enns,	1
and	1
then	1
guessed	1
that	1
the	1
card	1
that	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
hand	1
from	1
the	1
crumpled	1
heap	1
under	1
the	1
table	1
would	1
save	1
him,	1
now	1
counted	1
the	1
cords	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
card	1
with	1
that	1
number	1
and	1
tried	1
staking	1
the	1
total	1
of	1
his	1
losses	1
on	1
it,	1
then	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
for	1
aid	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
players,	1
or	1
peered	1
at	1
the	1
now	1
cold	1
face	1
of	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
read	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"He	1
knows	1
of	1
course	1
what	1
this	1
loss	1
means	1
to	1
me.	1
He	1
can't	1
want	1
my	1
ruin.	1
Wasn't	1
he	1
my	1
friend?	1
Wasn't	1
I	1
fond	1
of	1
him?	1
But	1
it's	1
not	1
his	1
fault.	1
What's	1
he	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
such	1
luck?...	1
And	1
it's	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
either,"	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
himself,	1
"I	1
have	1
done	1
nothing	1
wrong.	1
Have	1
I	1
killed	1
anyone,	1
or	1
insulted	1
or	1
wished	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone?	1
Why	1
such	1
a	1
terrible	1
misfortune?	1
And	1
when	1
did	1
it	1
begin?	1
Such	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
ago	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
this	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
winning	1
a	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
to	1
buy	1
that	1
casket	1
for	1
Mamma's	1
name	1
day	1
and	1
then	1
going	1
home.	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
happy,	1
so	1
free,	1
so	1
lighthearted!	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
was!	1
When	1
did	1
that	1
end	1
and	1
when	1
did	1
this	1
new,	1
terrible	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
begin?	1
What	1
marked	1
the	1
change?	1
I	1
sat	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
place	1
at	1
this	1
table,	1
chose	1
and	1
placed	1
cards,	1
and	1
watched	1
those	1
broad-boned	1
agile	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
When	1
did	1
it	1
happen	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
happened?	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
and	1
strong	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place.	1
No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!	1
Surely	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
end	1
in	1
nothing!"	1
	1
He	1
was	1
flushed	1
and	1
bathed	1
in	1
perspiration,	1
though	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
not	1
hot.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
terrible	1
and	1
piteous	1
to	1
see,	1
especially	1
from	1
its	1
helpless	1
efforts	1
to	1
seem	1
calm.	1
	1
The	1
score	1
against	1
him	1
reached	1
the	1
fateful	1
sum	1
of	1
forty-three	1
thousand.	1
Rostov	1
had	1
just	1
prepared	1
a	1
card,	1
by	1
bending	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
double	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
just	1
put	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
score,	1
when	1
Dolokhov,	1
slamming	1
down	1
the	1
pack	1
of	1
cards,	1
put	1
it	1
aside	1
and	1
began	1
rapidly	1
adding	1
up	1
the	1
total	1
of	1
Rostov's	1
debt,	1
breaking	1
the	1
chalk	1
as	1
he	1
marked	1
the	1
figures	1
in	1
his	1
clear,	1
bold	1
hand.	1
	1
"Supper,	1
it's	1
time	1
for	1
supper!	1
And	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
gypsies!"	1
	1
Some	1
swarthy	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
were	1
really	1
entering	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
outside	1
and	1
saying	1
something	1
in	1
their	1
gypsy	1
accents.	1
Nicholas	1
understood	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over;	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
indifferent	1
tone:	1
	1
"Well,	1
won't	1
you	1
go	1
on?	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
splendid	1
card	1
all	1
ready,"	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
fun	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
which	1
interested	1
him	1
most.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
up!	1
I'm	1
lost!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"Now	1
a	1
bullet	1
through	1
my	1
brain--	1
that's	1
all	1
that's	1
left	1
me!"	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
voice:	1
	1
"Come	1
now,	1
just	1
this	1
one	1
more	1
little	1
card!"	1
	1
"All	1
right!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
having	1
finished	1
the	1
addition.	1
"All	1
right!	1
Twenty-one	1
rubles,"	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
figure	1
twenty-one	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
total	1
exceeded	1
the	1
round	1
sum	1
of	1
forty-three	1
thousand;	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
pack	1
he	1
prepared	1
to	1
deal.	1
Rostov	1
submissively	1
unbent	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
card	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
six	1
thousand	1
he	1
had	1
intended,	1
carefully	1
wrote	1
twenty-one.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
win	1
this	1
ten,	1
or	1
beat	1
it."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
began	1
to	1
deal	1
seriously.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
Rostov	1
detested	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
those	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
short	1
reddish	1
fingers	1
and	1
hairy	1
wrists,	1
which	1
held	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
power....	1
The	1
ten	1
fell	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
owe	1
forty-three	1
thousand,	1
Count,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
stretching	1
himself	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table.	1
"One	1
does	1
get	1
tired	1
sitting	1
so	1
long,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I'm	1
tired	1
too,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
cut	1
him	1
short,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
remind	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
jest.	1
	1
"When	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
money,	1
Count?"	1
	1
Rostov,	1
flushing,	1
drew	1
Dolokhov	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
pay	1
it	1
all	1
immediately.	1
Will	1
you	1
take	1
an	1
I.O.U.?"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Rostov,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
clearly,	1
smiling	1
and	1
looking	1
Nicholas	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
eyes,	1
"you	1
know	1
the	1
saying,	1
'Lucky	1
in	1
love,	1
unlucky	1
at	1
cards.'	1
Your	1
cousin	1
is	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
know."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
terrible	1
to	1
feel	1
oneself	1
so	1
in	1
this	1
man's	1
power,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
He	1
knew	1
what	1
a	1
shock	1
he	1
would	1
inflict	1
on	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
by	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
this	1
loss,	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
a	1
relief	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
escape	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
this	1
shame	1
and	1
sorrow,	1
but	1
wanted	1
now	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
cat	1
does	1
with	1
a	1
mouse.	1
	1
"Your	1
cousin..."	1
Dolokhov	1
started	1
to	1
say,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"My	1
cousin	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
and	1
it's	1
not	1
necessary	1
to	1
mention	1
her!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
fiercely.	1
	1
"Then	1
when	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
have	1
it?"	1
	1
"Tomorrow,"	1
replied	1
Rostov	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
To	1
say	1
"tomorrow"	1
and	1
keep	1
up	1
a	1
dignified	1
tone	1
was	1
not	1
difficult,	1
but	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
alone,	1
see	1
his	1
sisters,	1
brother,	1
mother,	1
and	1
father,	1
confess	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
money	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
after	1
giving	1
his	1
word	1
of	1
honor,	1
was	1
terrible.	1
	1
At	1
home,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
gone	1
to	1
bed.	1
The	1
young	1
people,	1
after	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
theater,	1
had	1
had	1
supper	1
and	1
were	1
grouped	1
round	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
entered,	1
he	1
was	1
enfolded	1
in	1
that	1
poetic	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
love	1
which	1
pervaded	1
the	1
Rostov	1
household	1
that	1
winter	1
and,	1
now	1
after	1
Dolokhov's	1
proposal	1
and	1
Iogel's	1
ball,	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
grown	1
thicker	1
round	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
as	1
the	1
air	1
does	1
before	1
a	1
thunderstorm.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
in	1
the	1
light-blue	1
dresses	1
they	1
had	1
worn	1
at	1
the	1
theater,	1
looking	1
pretty	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
it,	1
were	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
happy	1
and	1
smiling.	1
Vera	1
was	1
playing	1
chess	1
with	1
Shinshin	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
old	1
countess,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
son,	1
sat	1
playing	1
patience	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
gentlewoman	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
their	1
house.	1
Denisov,	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
and	1
ruffled	1
hair,	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
clavichord	1
striking	1
chords	1
with	1
his	1
short	1
fingers,	1
his	1
legs	1
thrown	1
back	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
rolling	1
as	1
he	1
sang,	1
with	1
his	1
small,	1
husky,	1
but	1
true	1
voice,	1
some	1
verses	1
called	1
"Enchantress,"	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
composed,	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
fit	1
music:	1
	1
	1
Enchantress,	1
say,	1
to	1
my	1
forsaken	1
lyre	1
What	1
magic	1
power	1
is	1
this	1
recalls	1
me	1
still?	1
What	1
spark	1
has	1
set	1
my	1
inmost	1
soul	1
on	1
fire,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
bliss	1
that	1
makes	1
my	1
fingers	1
thrill?	1
	1
He	1
was	1
singing	1
in	1
passionate	1
tones,	1
gazing	1
with	1
his	1
sparkling	1
black-	1
agate	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
frightened	1
and	1
happy	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Splendid!	1
Excellent!"	1
exclaimed	1
Natasha.	1
"Another	1
verse,"	1
she	1
said,	1
without	1
noticing	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Everything's	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
them,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
glancing	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
he	1
saw	1
Vera	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
lady.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
and	1
here's	1
Nicholas!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Is	1
Papa	1
at	1
home?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
you've	1
come!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
without	1
answering	1
him.	1
"We	1
are	1
enjoying	1
ourselves!	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich	1
is	1
staying	1
a	1
day	1
longer	1
for	1
my	1
sake!	1
Did	1
you	1
know?"	1
	1
"No,	1
Papa	1
is	1
not	1
back	1
yet,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
have	1
you	1
come?	1
Come	1
here,	1
dear!"	1
called	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
to	1
her,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
silently	1
at	1
her	1
table	1
began	1
to	1
watch	1
her	1
hands	1
arranging	1
the	1
cards.	1
From	1
the	1
dancing	1
room,	1
they	1
still	1
heard	1
the	1
laughter	1
and	1
merry	1
voices	1
trying	1
to	1
persuade	1
Natasha	1
to	1
sing.	1
	1
"All	1
wight!	1
All	1
wight!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov.	1
"It's	1
no	1
good	1
making	1
excuses	1
now!	1
It's	1
your	1
turn	1
to	1
sing	1
the	1
ba'cawolla--I	1
entweat	1
you!"	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
silent	1
son.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
nothing,"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
if	1
weary	1
of	1
being	1
continually	1
asked	1
the	1
same	1
question.	1
"Will	1
Papa	1
be	1
back	1
soon?"	1
	1
"I	1
expect	1
so."	1
	1
"Everything's	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
them.	1
They	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it!	1
Where	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
go?"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
went	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
dancing	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
clavichord	1
stood.	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
playing	1
the	1
prelude	1
to	1
Denisov's	1
favorite	1
barcarolle.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
sing.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
enraptured	1
eyes.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
began	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Why	1
do	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
sing?	1
How	1
can	1
she	1
sing?	1
There's	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
about!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
Sonya	1
struck	1
the	1
first	1
chord	1
of	1
the	1
prelude.	1
	1
"My	1
God,	1
I'm	1
a	1
ruined	1
and	1
dishonored	1
man!	1
A	1
bullet	1
through	1
my	1
brain	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
left	1
me--not	1
singing!"	1
his	1
thoughts	1
ran	1
on.	1
"Go	1
away?	1
But	1
where	1
to?	1
It's	1
one--let	1
them	1
sing!"	1
	1
He	1
continued	1
to	1
pace	1
the	1
room,	1
looking	1
gloomily	1
at	1
Denisov	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
and	1
avoiding	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Nikolenka,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
Sonya's	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
seemed	1
to	1
ask.	1
She	1
noticed	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
Natasha	1
too,	1
with	1
her	1
quick	1
instinct,	1
had	1
instantly	1
noticed	1
her	1
brother's	1
condition.	1
But,	1
though	1
she	1
noticed	1
it,	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
in	1
such	1
high	1
spirits	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
sorrow,	1
sadness,	1
or	1
self-reproach,	1
that	1
she	1
purposely	1
deceived	1
herself	1
as	1
young	1
people	1
often	1
do.	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
happy	1
now	1
to	1
spoil	1
my	1
enjoyment	1
by	1
sympathy	1
with	1
anyone's	1
sorrow,"	1
she	1
felt,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself:	1
"No,	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
mistaken,	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
feeling	1
happy,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
am."	1
	1
"Now,	1
Sonya!"	1
she	1
said,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
where	1
she	1
considered	1
the	1
resonance	1
was	1
best.	1
	1
Having	1
lifted	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
arms	1
droop	1
lifelessly,	1
as	1
ballet	1
dancers	1
do,	1
Natasha,	1
rising	1
energetically	1
from	1
her	1
heels	1
to	1
her	1
toes,	1
stepped	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
me!"	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
answering	1
the	1
rapt	1
gaze	1
with	1
which	1
Denisov	1
followed	1
her.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
so	1
pleased	1
about?"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
sister.	1
"Why	1
isn't	1
she	1
dull	1
and	1
ashamed?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
took	1
the	1
first	1
note,	1
her	1
throat	1
swelled,	1
her	1
chest	1
rose,	1
her	1
eyes	1
became	1
serious.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
oblivious	1
of	1
her	1
surroundings,	1
and	1
from	1
her	1
smiling	1
lips	1
flowed	1
sounds	1
which	1
anyone	1
may	1
produce	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
intervals	1
and	1
hold	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
but	1
which	1
leave	1
you	1
cold	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
thousand	1
and	1
first	1
time	1
thrill	1
you	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
weep.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
that	1
winter,	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
begun	1
to	1
sing	1
seriously,	1
mainly	1
because	1
Denisov	1
so	1
delighted	1
in	1
her	1
singing.	1
She	1
no	1
longer	1
sang	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
her	1
singing	1
that	1
comical,	1
childish,	1
painstaking	1
effect	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
it	1
before;	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
sing	1
well,	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
connoisseurs	1
who	1
heard	1
her	1
said:	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
trained,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
beautiful	1
voice	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
trained."	1
Only	1
they	1
generally	1
said	1
this	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
singing.	1
While	1
that	1
untrained	1
voice,	1
with	1
its	1
incorrect	1
breathing	1
and	1
labored	1
transitions,	1
was	1
sounding,	1
even	1
the	1
connoisseurs	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
only	1
delighted	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
again.	1
In	1
her	1
voice	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
virginal	1
freshness,	1
an	1
unconsciousness	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
powers,	1
and	1
an	1
as	1
yet	1
untrained	1
velvety	1
softness,	1
which	1
so	1
mingled	1
with	1
her	1
lack	1
of	1
art	1
in	1
singing	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
in	1
that	1
voice	1
could	1
be	1
altered	1
without	1
spoiling	1
it.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
this?"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
widely	1
opened	1
eyes.	1
"What	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
her?	1
How	1
she	1
is	1
singing	1
today!"	1
And	1
suddenly	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
centered	1
for	1
him	1
on	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
note,	1
the	1
next	1
phrase,	1
and	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
three	1
beats:	1
"Oh	1
mio	1
crudele	1
affetto."...	1
One,	1
two,	1
three...	1
one,	1
two,	1
three...	1
One...	1
"Oh	1
mio	1
crudele	1
affetto."...	1
One,	1
two,	1
three...	1
One.	1
"Oh,	1
this	1
senseless	1
life	1
of	1
ours!"	1
thought	1
Nicholas.	1
"All	1
this	1
misery,	1
and	1
money,	1
and	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
anger,	1
and	1
honor--it's	1
all	1
nonsense...	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
real....	1
Now	1
then,	1
Natasha,	1
now	1
then,	1
dearest!	1
Now	1
then,	1
darling!	1
How	1
will	1
she	1
take	1
that	1
si?	1
She's	1
taken	1
it!	1
Thank	1
God!"	1
And	1
without	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
singing,	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
si	1
he	1
sung	1
a	1
second,	1
a	1
third	1
below	1
the	1
high	1
note.	1
"Ah,	1
God!	1
How	1
fine!	1
Did	1
I	1
really	1
take	1
it?	1
How	1
fortunate!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
Oh,	1
how	1
that	1
chord	1
vibrated,	1
and	1
how	1
moved	1
was	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
finest	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
soul!	1
And	1
this	1
something	1
was	1
apart	1
from	1
everything	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
above	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
"What	1
were	1
losses,	1
and	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
words	1
of	1
honor?...	1
All	1
nonsense!	1
One	1
might	1
kill	1
and	1
rob	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
happy..."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
Rostov	1
had	1
felt	1
such	1
enjoyment	1
from	1
music	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
day.	1
But	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
Natasha	1
finished	1
her	1
barcarolle	1
than	1
reality	1
again	1
presented	1
itself.	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
went	1
downstairs	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
room.	1
A	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
his	1
club,	1
cheerful	1
and	1
contented.	1
Nicholas,	1
hearing	1
him	1
drive	1
up,	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
	1
"Well--had	1
a	1
good	1
time?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
smiling	1
gaily	1
and	1
proudly	1
at	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
"Yes,"	1
but	1
could	1
not:	1
and	1
he	1
nearly	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
lighting	1
his	1
pipe	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
his	1
son's	1
condition.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
avoided!"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
last	1
time.	1
And	1
suddenly,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
casual	1
tone,	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
of	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
merely	1
asking	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
town:	1
	1
"Papa,	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
business.	1
I	1
was	1
nearly	1
forgetting.	1
I	1
need	1
some	1
money."	1
	1
"Dear	1
me!"	1
said	1
his	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
specially	1
good	1
humor.	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
enough.	1
How	1
much?"	1
	1
"Very	1
much,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
flushing,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stupid	1
careless	1
smile,	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
long	1
unable	1
to	1
forgive	1
himself,	1
"I	1
have	1
lost	1
a	1
little,	1
I	1
mean	1
a	1
good	1
deal,	1
a	1
great	1
deal--forty	1
three	1
thousand."	1
	1
"What!	1
To	1
whom?...	1
Nonsense!"	1
cried	1
the	1
count,	1
suddenly	1
reddening	1
with	1
an	1
apoplectic	1
flush	1
over	1
neck	1
and	1
nape	1
as	1
old	1
people	1
do.	1
	1
"I	1
promised	1
to	1
pay	1
tomorrow,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Well!..."	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
sinking	1
helplessly	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped	1
It	1
happens	1
to	1
everyone!"	1
said	1
the	1
son,	1
with	1
a	1
bold,	1
free,	1
and	1
easy	1
tone,	1
while	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
he	1
regarded	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
worthless	1
scoundrel	1
whose	1
whole	1
life	1
could	1
not	1
atone	1
for	1
his	1
crime.	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
kiss	1
his	1
father's	1
hands	1
and	1
kneel	1
to	1
beg	1
his	1
forgiveness,	1
but	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
careless	1
and	1
even	1
rude	1
voice,	1
that	1
it	1
happens	1
to	1
everyone!	1
	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
cast	1
down	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
hearing	1
his	1
son's	1
words	1
and	1
began	1
bustlingly	1
searching	1
for	1
something.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
"it	1
will	1
be	1
difficult,	1
I	1
fear,	1
difficult	1
to	1
raise...	1
happens	1
to	1
everybody!	1
Yes,	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
done	1
it?"	1
	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
furtive	1
glance	1
at	1
his	1
son's	1
face,	1
the	1
count	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room....	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
for	1
resistance,	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
expected	1
this.	1
	1
"Papa!	1
Pa-pa!"	1
he	1
called	1
after	1
him,	1
sobbing,	1
"forgive	1
me!"	1
And	1
seizing	1
his	1
father's	1
hand,	1
he	1
pressed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
While	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
were	1
having	1
their	1
explanation,	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
daughter	1
were	1
having	1
one	1
not	1
less	1
important.	1
Natasha	1
came	1
running	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
quite	1
excited.	1
	1
"Mamma!...	1
Mamma!...	1
He	1
has	1
made	1
me..."	1
	1
"Made	1
what?"	1
	1
"Made,	1
made	1
me	1
an	1
offer,	1
Mamma!	1
Mamma!"	1
she	1
exclaimed.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
her	1
ears.	1
Denisov	1
had	1
proposed.	1
To	1
whom?	1
To	1
this	1
chit	1
of	1
a	1
girl,	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
not	1
so	1
long	1
ago	1
was	1
playing	1
with	1
dolls	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
having	1
lessons.	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Natasha!	1
What	1
nonsense!"	1
she	1
said,	1
hoping	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
joke.	1
	1
"Nonsense,	1
indeed!	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
you	1
the	1
fact,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
indignantly.	1
"I	1
come	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
you	1
call	1
it	1
'nonsense!'"	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
shrugged	1
her	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
Monsieur	1
Denisov	1
has	1
made	1
you	1
a	1
proposal,	1
tell	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
fool,	1
that's	1
all!"	1
	1
"No,	1
he's	1
not	1
a	1
fool!"	1
replied	1
Natasha	1
indignantly	1
and	1
seriously.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want?	1
You're	1
all	1
in	1
love	1
nowadays.	1
Well,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
love,	1
marry	1
him!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
of	1
annoyance.	1
"Good	1
luck	1
to	1
you!"	1
	1
"No,	1
Mamma,	1
I'm	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him,	1
I	1
suppose	1
I'm	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
tell	1
him	1
so."	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
are	1
you	1
cross?	1
Don't	1
be	1
cross,	1
dear!	1
Is	1
it	1
my	1
fault?"	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
it,	1
my	1
dear?	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
him?"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
smiling.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
myself,	1
only	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
It's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
a	1
responsive	1
smile.	1
"You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
he	1
said	1
it!	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
came	1
out	1
accidently."	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
you	1
must	1
refuse	1
him."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
mustn't.	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
him!	1
He's	1
so	1
nice."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
accept	1
his	1
offer.	1
It's	1
high	1
time	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
married,"	1
answered	1
the	1
countess	1
sharply	1
and	1
sarcastically.	1
	1
"No,	1
Mamma,	1
but	1
I'm	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
him.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
I'm	1
to	1
say	1
it."	1
	1
"And	1
there's	1
nothing	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
say.	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
myself,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
indignant	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
treat	1
this	1
little	1
Natasha	1
as	1
grown	1
up.	1
	1
"No,	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account!	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
him	1
myself,	1
and	1
you'll	1
listen	1
at	1
the	1
door,"	1
and	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
the	1
dancing	1
hall,	1
where	1
Denisov	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
chair	1
by	1
the	1
clavichord	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
He	1
jumped	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
light	1
step.	1
	1
"Nataly,"	1
he	1
said,	1
moving	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
toward	1
her,	1
"decide	1
my	1
fate.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
hands."	1
	1
"Vasili	1
Dmitrich,	1
I'm	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
you!...	1
No,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
nice...	1
but	1
it	1
won't	1
do...not	1
that...	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
friend,	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
love	1
you."	1
	1
Denisov	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
she	1
heard	1
strange	1
sounds	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
She	1
kissed	1
his	1
rough	1
curly	1
black	1
head.	1
At	1
this	1
instant,	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
quick	1
rustle	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
dress.	1
She	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
"Vasili	1
Dmitrich,	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
honor,"	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
an	1
embarrassed	1
voice,	1
though	1
it	1
sounded	1
severe	1
to	1
Denisov--"but	1
my	1
daughter	1
is	1
so	1
young,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
that,	1
as	1
my	1
son's	1
friend,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
addressed	1
yourself	1
first	1
to	1
me.	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
obliged	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
this	1
refusal."	1
	1
"Countess..."	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
guilty	1
face.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
more,	1
but	1
faltered.	1
	1
Natasha	1
could	1
not	1
remain	1
calm,	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
plight.	1
She	1
began	1
to	1
sob	1
aloud.	1
	1
"Countess,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
w'ong,"	1
Denisov	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
an	1
unsteady	1
voice,	1
"but	1
believe	1
me,	1
I	1
so	1
adore	1
your	1
daughter	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
family	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
twice	1
over..."	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
seeing	1
her	1
severe	1
face	1
said:	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
Countess,"	1
and	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
quick	1
resolute	1
strides,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
Denisov	1
off.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
stay	1
another	1
day	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
All	1
Denisov's	1
Moscow	1
friends	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
farewell	1
entertainment	1
at	1
the	1
gypsies',	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
recollection	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
sleigh	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
three	1
stages	1
of	1
his	1
journey.	1
	1
After	1
Denisov's	1
departure,	1
Rostov	1
spent	1
another	1
fortnight	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
without	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
money	1
his	1
father	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
raise,	1
and	1
he	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
girls'	1
room.	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
more	1
tender	1
and	1
devoted	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
ever.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
losses	1
were	1
an	1
achievement	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
love	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
now	1
considered	1
himself	1
unworthy	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
He	1
filled	1
the	1
girls'	1
albums	1
with	1
verses	1
and	1
music,	1
and	1
having	1
at	1
last	1
sent	1
Dolokhov	1
the	1
whole	1
forty-three	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
and	1
received	1
his	1
receipt,	1
he	1
left	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
November,	1
without	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintances,	1
to	1
overtake	1
his	1
regiment	1
which	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
Poland.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
After	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Pierre	1
left	1
for	1
Petersburg.	1
At	1
the	1
Torzhok	1
post	1
station,	1
either	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
horses	1
or	1
the	1
postmaster	1
would	1
not	1
supply	1
them.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
wait.	1
Without	1
undressing,	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
leather	1
sofa	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
round	1
table,	1
put	1
his	1
big	1
feet	1
in	1
their	1
overboots	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
reflect.	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
portmanteaus	1
brought	1
in?	1
And	1
a	1
bed	1
got	1
ready,	1
and	1
tea?"	1
asked	1
his	1
valet.	1
	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
no	1
answer,	1
for	1
he	1
neither	1
heard	1
nor	1
saw	1
anything.	1
He	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
station	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
pondering	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
question--one	1
so	1
important	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
around	1
him.	1
Not	1
only	1
was	1
he	1
indifferent	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
earlier	1
or	1
later,	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
secured	1
accommodation	1
at	1
this	1
station,	1
but	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
now	1
occupied	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference	1
whether	1
he	1
remained	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
The	1
postmaster,	1
his	1
wife,	1
the	1
valet,	1
and	1
a	1
peasant	1
woman	1
selling	1
Torzhok	1
embroidery	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
offering	1
their	1
services.	1
Without	1
changing	1
his	1
careless	1
attitude,	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
or	1
how	1
they	1
could	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
without	1
having	1
solved	1
the	1
problems	1
that	1
so	1
absorbed	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
engrossed	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
thoughts	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
Sokolniki	1
after	1
the	1
duel	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
that	1
first	1
agonizing,	1
sleepless	1
night.	1
But	1
now,	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
the	1
journey,	1
they	1
seized	1
him	1
with	1
special	1
force.	1
No	1
matter	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
about,	1
he	1
always	1
returned	1
to	1
these	1
same	1
questions	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
solve	1
and	1
yet	1
could	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
ask	1
himself.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
screw	1
which	1
held	1
his	1
life	1
together	1
were	1
stripped,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
screw	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
in	1
or	1
out,	1
but	1
went	1
on	1
turning	1
uselessly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place.	1
	1
The	1
postmaster	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
began	1
obsequiously	1
to	1
beg	1
his	1
excellency	1
to	1
wait	1
only	1
two	1
hours,	1
when,	1
come	1
what	1
might,	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
his	1
excellency	1
have	1
the	1
courier	1
horses.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
lying	1
and	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
more	1
money	1
from	1
the	1
traveler.	1
	1
"Is	1
this	1
good	1
or	1
bad?"	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
himself.	1
"It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
me,	1
bad	1
for	1
another	1
traveler,	1
and	1
for	1
himself	1
it's	1
unavoidable,	1
because	1
he	1
needs	1
money	1
for	1
food;	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
an	1
officer	1
had	1
once	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
thrashing	1
for	1
letting	1
a	1
private	1
traveler	1
have	1
the	1
courier	1
horses.	1
But	1
the	1
officer	1
thrashed	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible.	1
And	1
I,"	1
continued	1
Pierre,	1
"shot	1
Dolokhov	1
because	1
I	1
considered	1
myself	1
injured,	1
and	1
Louis	1
XVI	1
was	1
executed	1
because	1
they	1
considered	1
him	1
a	1
criminal,	1
and	1
a	1
year	1
later	1
they	1
executed	1
those	1
who	1
executed	1
him--also	1
for	1
some	1
reason.	1
What	1
is	1
bad?	1
What	1
is	1
good?	1
What	1
should	1
one	1
love	1
and	1
what	1
hate?	1
What	1
does	1
one	1
live	1
for?	1
And	1
what	1
am	1
I?	1
What	1
is	1
life,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
death?	1
What	1
power	1
governs	1
all?"	1
	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
answer	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
questions,	1
except	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
logical	1
answer	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
them.	1
The	1
answer	1
was:	1
"You'll	1
die	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
end.	1
You'll	1
die	1
and	1
know	1
all,	1
or	1
cease	1
asking."	1
But	1
dying	1
was	1
also	1
dreadful.	1
	1
The	1
Torzhok	1
peddler	1
woman,	1
in	1
a	1
whining	1
voice,	1
went	1
on	1
offering	1
her	1
wares,	1
especially	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
goatskin	1
slippers.	1
"I	1
have	1
hundreds	1
of	1
rubles	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with,	1
and	1
she	1
stands	1
in	1
her	1
tattered	1
cloak	1
looking	1
timidly	1
at	1
me,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"And	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
want	1
the	1
money	1
for?	1
As	1
if	1
that	1
money	1
could	1
add	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth	1
to	1
happiness	1
or	1
peace	1
of	1
mind.	1
Can	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
make	1
her	1
or	1
me	1
less	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
evil	1
and	1
death?--death	1
which	1
ends	1
all	1
and	1
must	1
come	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow--	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
compared	1
with	1
eternity."	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
twisted	1
the	1
screw	1
with	1
the	1
stripped	1
thread,	1
and	1
again	1
it	1
turned	1
uselessly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place.	1
	1
His	1
servant	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
half-cut	1
novel,	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
letters,	1
by	1
Madame	1
de	1
Souza.	1
He	1
began	1
reading	1
about	1
the	1
sufferings	1
and	1
virtuous	1
struggles	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
Emilie	1
de	1
Mansfeld.	1
"And	1
why	1
did	1
she	1
resist	1
her	1
seducer	1
when	1
she	1
loved	1
him?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"God	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
put	1
into	1
her	1
heart	1
an	1
impulse	1
that	1
was	1
against	1
His	1
will.	1
My	1
wife--as	1
she	1
once	1
was--did	1
not	1
struggle,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
she	1
was	1
right.	1
Nothing	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
out,	1
nothing	1
discovered,"	1
Pierre	1
again	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"All	1
we	1
can	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
nothing.	1
And	1
that's	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
human	1
wisdom."	1
	1
Everything	1
within	1
and	1
around	1
him	1
seemed	1
confused,	1
senseless,	1
and	1
repellent.	1
Yet	1
in	1
this	1
very	1
repugnance	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
circumstances	1
Pierre	1
found	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
tantalizing	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
"I	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
ask	1
your	1
excellency	1
to	1
move	1
a	1
little	1
for	1
this	1
gentleman,"	1
said	1
the	1
postmaster,	1
entering	1
the	1
room	1
followed	1
by	1
another	1
traveler,	1
also	1
detained	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
horses.	1
	1
The	1
newcomer	1
was	1
a	1
short,	1
large-boned,	1
yellow-faced,	1
wrinkled	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
gray	1
bushy	1
eyebrows	1
overhanging	1
bright	1
eyes	1
of	1
an	1
indefinite	1
grayish	1
color.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
his	1
feet	1
off	1
the	1
table,	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
got	1
ready	1
for	1
him,	1
glancing	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
newcomer,	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
and	1
tired	1
face,	1
was	1
wearily	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
wraps	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
With	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
felt	1
boots	1
on	1
his	1
thin	1
bony	1
legs,	1
and	1
keeping	1
on	1
a	1
worn,	1
nankeen-covered,	1
sheepskin	1
coat,	1
the	1
traveler	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
leaned	1
back	1
his	1
big	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
broad	1
temples	1
and	1
close-cropped	1
hair,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Bezukhov.	1
The	1
stern,	1
shrewd,	1
and	1
penetrating	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
look	1
struck	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
felt	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
stranger,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
a	1
question	1
about	1
the	1
roads,	1
the	1
traveler	1
had	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
His	1
shriveled	1
old	1
hands	1
were	1
folded	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
a	1
large	1
cast	1
iron	1
ring	1
with	1
a	1
seal	1
representing	1
a	1
death's	1
head.	1
The	1
stranger	1
sat	1
without	1
stirring,	1
either	1
resting	1
or,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
sunk	1
in	1
profound	1
and	1
calm	1
meditation.	1
His	1
servant	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
yellow,	1
wrinkled	1
old	1
man,	1
without	1
beard	1
or	1
mustache,	1
evidently	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
shaven	1
but	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
grown.	1
This	1
active	1
old	1
servant	1
was	1
unpacking	1
the	1
traveler's	1
canteen	1
and	1
preparing	1
tea.	1
He	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
boiling	1
samovar.	1
When	1
everything	1
was	1
ready,	1
the	1
stranger	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
filled	1
a	1
tumbler	1
with	1
tea	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
beardless	1
old	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
passed	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
uneasiness,	1
and	1
the	1
need,	1
even	1
the	1
inevitability,	1
of	1
entering	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
this	1
stranger.	1
	1
The	1
servant	1
brought	1
back	1
his	1
tumbler	1
turned	1
upside	1
down,	1
*	1
with	1
an	1
unfinished	1
bit	1
of	1
nibbled	1
sugar,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
anything	1
more	1
would	1
be	1
wanted.	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
indicate	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
more	1
tea.	1
	1
"No.	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
book,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger.	1
	1
The	1
servant	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
book	1
which	1
Pierre	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
devotional	1
work,	1
and	1
the	1
traveler	1
became	1
absorbed	1
in	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
stranger	1
closed	1
the	1
book,	1
putting	1
in	1
a	1
marker,	1
and	1
again,	1
leaning	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
sofa,	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
former	1
position	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes,	1
fixed	1
his	1
steady	1
and	1
severe	1
gaze	1
straight	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
face.	1
	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
confused	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
that	1
look,	1
but	1
the	1
bright	1
old	1
eyes	1
attracted	1
him	1
irresistibly.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
addressing	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mistaken,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
deliberate	1
and	1
loud	1
voice.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
silently	1
and	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
continued	1
the	1
stranger,	1
"and	1
of	1
your	1
misfortune."	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
emphasize	1
the	1
last	1
word,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say--"Yes,	1
misfortune!	1
Call	1
it	1
what	1
you	1
please,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
Moscow	1
was	1
a	1
misfortune."--"I	1
regret	1
it	1
very	1
much,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir."	1
	1
Pierre	1
flushed	1
and,	1
hurriedly	1
putting	1
his	1
legs	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
bed,	1
bent	1
forward	1
toward	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
and	1
timid	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
referred	1
to	1
this	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
but	1
for	1
greater	1
reasons."	1
	1
He	1
paused,	1
his	1
gaze	1
still	1
on	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
moved	1
aside	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
inviting	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
reluctant	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
this	1
old	1
man,	1
but,	1
submitting	1
to	1
him	1
involuntarily,	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
unhappy,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
the	1
stranger	1
continued.	1
"You	1
are	1
young	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
old.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
help	1
you	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
lies	1
in	1
my	1
power."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
smile.	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you.	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
traveling	1
from?"	1
	1
The	1
stranger's	1
face	1
was	1
not	1
genial,	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
cold	1
and	1
severe,	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this,	1
both	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
were	1
irresistibly	1
attractive	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
for	1
reason	1
you	1
don't	1
feel	1
inclined	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
"say	1
so,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir."	1
And	1
he	1
suddenly	1
smiled,	1
in	1
an	1
unexpected	1
and	1
tenderly	1
paternal	1
way.	1
	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
not	1
at	1
all!	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
acquaintance,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
And	1
again,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
stranger's	1
hands,	1
he	1
looked	1
more	1
closely	1
at	1
the	1
ring,	1
with	1
its	1
skull--a	1
masonic	1
sign.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
ask,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"are	1
you	1
a	1
Mason?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
of	1
the	1
Freemasons,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger,	1
looking	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
"And	1
in	1
their	1
name	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
I	1
hold	1
out	1
a	1
brotherly	1
hand	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
smiling,	1
and	1
wavering	1
between	1
the	1
confidence	1
the	1
personality	1
of	1
the	1
Freemason	1
inspired	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
habit	1
of	1
ridiculing	1
the	1
masonic	1
beliefs--"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
understanding--how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
put	1
it?--I	1
am	1
afraid	1
my	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
so	1
opposed	1
to	1
yours	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
understand	1
one	1
another."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
your	1
outlook,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason,	1
"and	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
life	1
you	1
mention,	1
and	1
which	1
you	1
think	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
mental	1
efforts,	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
people,	1
and	1
is	1
the	1
invariable	1
fruit	1
of	1
pride,	1
indolence,	1
and	1
ignorance.	1
Forgive	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
it	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
addressed	1
you.	1
Your	1
view	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
regrettable	1
delusion."	1
	1
"Just	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
suppose	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
deluded,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
never	1
dare	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
truth,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason,	1
whose	1
words	1
struck	1
Pierre	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
by	1
their	1
precision	1
and	1
firmness.	1
"No	1
one	1
can	1
attain	1
to	1
truth	1
by	1
himself.	1
Only	1
by	1
laying	1
stone	1
on	1
stone	1
with	1
the	1
cooperation	1
of	1
all,	1
by	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
generations	1
from	1
our	1
forefather	1
Adam	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
times,	1
is	1
that	1
temple	1
reared	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
worthy	1
dwelling	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
God,"	1
he	1
added,	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"I	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe...	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
God,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
regretfully	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
effort,	1
feeling	1
it	1
essential	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and	1
smiled	1
as	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
with	1
millions	1
in	1
hand	1
might	1
smile	1
at	1
a	1
poor	1
fellow	1
who	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he,	1
poor	1
man,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
five	1
rubles	1
that	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
happy.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
Him,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason.	1
"You	1
cannot	1
know	1
Him.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
Him	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
you	1
are	1
unhappy."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
am	1
unhappy,"	1
assented	1
Pierre.	1
"But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?"	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
Him	1
not,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
unhappy.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
Him,	1
but	1
He	1
is	1
here,	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
words,	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
those	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
thou	1
hast	1
just	1
uttered!"	1
pronounced	1
the	1
Mason	1
in	1
a	1
stern	1
and	1
tremulous	1
voice.	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
and	1
sighed,	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
calm	1
himself.	1
	1
"If	1
He	1
were	1
not,"	1
he	1
said	1
quietly,	1
"you	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
speaking	1
of	1
Him,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir.	1
Of	1
what,	1
of	1
whom,	1
are	1
we	1
speaking?	1
Whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
denied?"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
asked	1
with	1
exulting	1
austerity	1
and	1
authority	1
in	1
his	1
voice.	1
"Who	1
invented	1
Him,	1
if	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
exist?	1
Whence	1
came	1
thy	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
Being?	1
didst	1
thou,	1
and	1
why	1
did	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
conceive	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
Being,	1
a	1
Being	1
all-powerful,	1
eternal,	1
and	1
infinite	1
in	1
all	1
His	1
attributes?..."	1
	1
He	1
stopped	1
and	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
break	1
this	1
silence.	1
	1
"He	1
exists,	1
but	1
to	1
understand	1
Him	1
is	1
hard,"	1
the	1
Mason	1
began	1
again,	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
Pierre	1
but	1
straight	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
turning	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
his	1
book	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
hands	1
which	1
from	1
excitement	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
still.	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
existence	1
thou	1
didst	1
doubt	1
I	1
could	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
thee,	1
could	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
show	1
him	1
to	1
thee.	1
But	1
how	1
can	1
I,	1
an	1
insignificant	1
mortal,	1
show	1
His	1
omnipotence,	1
His	1
infinity,	1
and	1
all	1
His	1
mercy	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
blind,	1
or	1
who	1
shuts	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
see	1
or	1
understand	1
Him	1
and	1
may	1
not	1
see	1
or	1
understand	1
his	1
own	1
vileness	1
and	1
sinfulness?"	1
He	1
paused	1
again.	1
"Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
Thou	1
dreamest	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
wise	1
because	1
thou	1
couldst	1
utter	1
those	1
blasphemous	1
words,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
with	1
a	1
somber	1
and	1
scornful	1
smile.	1
"And	1
thou	1
art	1
more	1
foolish	1
and	1
unreasonable	1
than	1
a	1
little	1
child,	1
who,	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
a	1
skillfully	1
made	1
watch,	1
dares	1
to	1
say	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
its	1
use,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
master	1
who	1
made	1
it.	1
To	1
know	1
Him	1
is	1
hard....	1
For	1
ages,	1
from	1
our	1
forefather	1
Adam	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
day,	1
we	1
labor	1
to	1
attain	1
that	1
knowledge	1
and	1
are	1
still	1
infinitely	1
far	1
from	1
our	1
aim;	1
but	1
in	1
our	1
lack	1
of	1
understanding	1
we	1
see	1
only	1
our	1
weakness	1
and	1
His	1
greatness...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
with	1
swelling	1
heart,	1
gazing	1
into	1
the	1
Mason's	1
face	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes,	1
not	1
interrupting	1
or	1
questioning	1
him,	1
but	1
believing	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
what	1
the	1
stranger	1
said.	1
Whether	1
he	1
accepted	1
the	1
wise	1
reasoning	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
Mason's	1
words,	1
or	1
believed	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
believes,	1
in	1
the	1
speaker's	1
tone	1
of	1
conviction	1
and	1
earnestness,	1
or	1
the	1
tremor	1
of	1
the	1
speaker's	1
voice--which	1
sometimes	1
almost	1
broke--or	1
those	1
brilliant	1
aged	1
eyes	1
grown	1
old	1
in	1
this	1
conviction,	1
or	1
the	1
calm	1
firmness	1
and	1
certainty	1
of	1
his	1
vocation,	1
which	1
radiated	1
from	1
his	1
whole	1
being	1
(and	1
which	1
struck	1
Pierre	1
especially	1
by	1
contrast	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
dejection	1
and	1
hopelessness)--at	1
any	1
rate,	1
Pierre	1
longed	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
believe,	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
joyful	1
sense	1
of	1
comfort,	1
regeneration,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
life.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
apprehended	1
by	1
reason,	1
but	1
by	1
life,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason.	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
feeling	1
with	1
dismay	1
doubts	1
reawakening.	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
clearness,	1
any	1
weakness,	1
in	1
the	1
Mason's	1
arguments;	1
he	1
dreaded	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
him.	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
man	1
cannot	1
attain	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
speak."	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
smiled	1
with	1
his	1
gentle	1
fatherly	1
smile.	1
	1
"The	1
highest	1
wisdom	1
and	1
truth	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
purest	1
liquid	1
we	1
may	1
wish	1
to	1
imbibe,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Can	1
I	1
receive	1
that	1
pure	1
liquid	1
into	1
an	1
impure	1
vessel	1
and	1
judge	1
of	1
its	1
purity?	1
Only	1
by	1
the	1
inner	1
purification	1
of	1
myself	1
can	1
I	1
retain	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
purity	1
the	1
liquid	1
I	1
receive."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
that	1
is	1
so,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
joyfully.	1
	1
"The	1
highest	1
wisdom	1
is	1
not	1
founded	1
on	1
reason	1
alone,	1
not	1
on	1
those	1
worldly	1
sciences	1
of	1
physics,	1
history,	1
chemistry,	1
and	1
the	1
like,	1
into	1
which	1
intellectual	1
knowledge	1
is	1
divided.	1
The	1
highest	1
wisdom	1
is	1
one.	1
The	1
highest	1
wisdom	1
has	1
but	1
one	1
science--the	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
whole--the	1
science	1
explaining	1
the	1
whole	1
creation	1
and	1
man's	1
place	1
in	1
it.	1
To	1
receive	1
that	1
science	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
purify	1
and	1
renew	1
one's	1
inner	1
self,	1
and	1
so	1
before	1
one	1
can	1
know,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
to	1
perfect	1
one's	1
self.	1
And	1
to	1
attain	1
this	1
end,	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
light	1
called	1
conscience	1
that	1
God	1
has	1
implanted	1
in	1
our	1
souls."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
assented	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Look	1
then	1
at	1
thy	1
inner	1
self	1
with	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
ask	1
thyself	1
whether	1
thou	1
art	1
content	1
with	1
thyself.	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
attained	1
relying	1
on	1
reason	1
only?	1
What	1
art	1
thou?	1
You	1
are	1
young,	1
you	1
are	1
rich,	1
you	1
are	1
clever,	1
you	1
are	1
well	1
educated.	1
And	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
good	1
gifts?	1
Are	1
you	1
content	1
with	1
yourself	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
life?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
hate	1
my	1
life,"	1
Pierre	1
muttered,	1
wincing.	1
	1
"Thou	1
hatest	1
it.	1
Then	1
change	1
it,	1
purify	1
thyself;	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
purified,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
gain	1
wisdom.	1
Look	1
at	1
your	1
life,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir.	1
How	1
have	1
you	1
spent	1
it?	1
In	1
riotous	1
orgies	1
and	1
debauchery,	1
receiving	1
everything	1
from	1
society	1
and	1
giving	1
nothing	1
in	1
return.	1
You	1
have	1
become	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
wealth.	1
How	1
have	1
you	1
used	1
it?	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
for	1
your	1
neighbor?	1
Have	1
you	1
ever	1
thought	1
of	1
your	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
slaves?	1
Have	1
you	1
helped	1
them	1
physically	1
and	1
morally?	1
No!	1
You	1
have	1
profited	1
by	1
their	1
toil	1
to	1
lead	1
a	1
profligate	1
life.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done.	1
Have	1
you	1
chosen	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
your	1
neighbor?	1
No!	1
You	1
have	1
spent	1
your	1
life	1
in	1
idleness.	1
Then	1
you	1
married,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir--took	1
on	1
yourself	1
responsibility	1
for	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
woman;	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done?	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
helped	1
her	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
truth,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
but	1
have	1
thrust	1
her	1
into	1
an	1
abyss	1
of	1
deceit	1
and	1
misery.	1
A	1
man	1
offended	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
shot	1
him,	1
and	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
God	1
and	1
hate	1
your	1
life.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
strange	1
in	1
that,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir!"	1
	1
After	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Mason,	1
as	1
if	1
tired	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
discourse,	1
again	1
leaned	1
his	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
that	1
aged,	1
stern,	1
motionless,	1
almost	1
lifeless	1
face	1
and	1
moved	1
his	1
lips	1
without	1
uttering	1
a	1
sound.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
say,	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
vile,	1
idle,	1
vicious	1
life!"	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
break	1
the	1
silence.	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
huskily,	1
as	1
old	1
men	1
do,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
"How	1
about	1
the	1
horses?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"The	1
exchange	1
horses	1
have	1
just	1
come,"	1
answered	1
the	1
servant.	1
"Will	1
you	1
not	1
rest	1
here?"	1
	1
"No,	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
harness."	1
	1
"Can	1
he	1
really	1
be	1
going	1
away	1
leaving	1
me	1
alone	1
without	1
having	1
told	1
me	1
all,	1
and	1
without	1
promising	1
to	1
help	1
me?"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
rising	1
with	1
downcast	1
head;	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
pace	1
the	1
room,	1
glancing	1
occasionally	1
at	1
the	1
Mason.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
led	1
a	1
contemptible	1
and	1
profligate	1
life,	1
though	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"But	1
this	1
man	1
knows	1
the	1
truth	1
and,	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to,	1
could	1
disclose	1
it	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
Mason,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to.	1
The	1
traveler,	1
having	1
packed	1
his	1
things	1
with	1
his	1
practiced	1
hands,	1
began	1
fastening	1
his	1
coat.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
indifferent	1
politeness:	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
now,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir?"	1
	1
"I?...	1
I'm	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg,"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
in	1
a	1
childlike,	1
hesitating	1
voice.	1
"I	1
thank	1
you.	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
said.	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
bad.	1
With	1
my	1
whole	1
soul	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
me	1
be,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
help	1
from	1
anyone....	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
I,	1
above	1
all,	1
who	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
everything.	1
Help	1
me,	1
teach	1
me,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
I	1
may..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on.	1
He	1
gulped	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
evidently	1
considering.	1
	1
"Help	1
comes	1
from	1
God	1
alone,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
such	1
measure	1
of	1
help	1
as	1
our	1
Order	1
can	1
bestow	1
it	1
will	1
render	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir.	1
You	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
Hand	1
this	1
to	1
Count	1
Willarski"	1
(he	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
notebook	1
and	1
wrote	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
folded	1
in	1
four).	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
advice.	1
When	1
you	1
reach	1
the	1
capital,	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
devote	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
solitude	1
and	1
self-examination	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
resume	1
your	1
former	1
way	1
of	1
life.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
a	1
good	1
journey,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
he	1
added,	1
seeing	1
that	1
his	1
servant	1
had	1
entered...	1
"and	1
success."	1
	1
The	1
traveler	1
was	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
Bazdeev,	1
as	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
from	1
the	1
postmaster's	1
book.	1
Bazdeev	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best-known	1
Freemasons	1
and	1
Martinists,	1
even	1
in	1
Novikov's	1
time.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
gone,	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
or	1
order	1
horses	1
but	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
pondering	1
over	1
his	1
vicious	1
past,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
rapturous	1
sense	1
of	1
beginning	1
anew	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
blissful,	1
irreproachable,	1
virtuous	1
future	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
easy.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
vicious	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
somehow	1
forgotten	1
how	1
good	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
virtuous.	1
Not	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
doubts	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
firmly	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
of	1
men	1
united	1
in	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
supporting	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
virtue,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
Freemasonry	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
Petersburg	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
anyone	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
arrival,	1
he	1
went	1
nowhere	1
and	1
spent	1
whole	1
days	1
in	1
reading	1
Thomas	1
a	1
Kempis,	1
whose	1
book	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
him	1
by	1
someone	1
unknown.	1
One	1
thing	1
he	1
continually	1
realized	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
that	1
book:	1
the	1
joy,	1
hitherto	1
unknown	1
to	1
him,	1
of	1
believing	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
attaining	1
perfection,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
active	1
brotherly	1
love	1
among	1
men,	1
which	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
had	1
revealed	1
to	1
him.	1
A	1
week	1
after	1
his	1
arrival,	1
the	1
young	1
Polish	1
count,	1
Willarski,	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
had	1
known	1
slightly	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society,	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
one	1
evening	1
in	1
the	1
official	1
and	1
ceremonious	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
Dolokhov's	1
second	1
had	1
called	1
on	1
him,	1
and,	1
having	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
addressed	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
and	1
an	1
offer,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
said	1
without	1
sitting	1
down.	1
"A	1
person	1
of	1
very	1
high	1
standing	1
in	1
our	1
Brotherhood	1
has	1
made	1
application	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
into	1
our	1
Order	1
before	1
the	1
usual	1
term	1
and	1
has	1
proposed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
sponsor.	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
a	1
sacred	1
duty	1
to	1
fulfill	1
that	1
person's	1
wishes.	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
of	1
Freemasons	1
under	1
my	1
sponsorship?"	1
	1
The	1
cold,	1
austere	1
tone	1
of	1
this	1
man,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
almost	1
always	1
before	1
met	1
at	1
balls,	1
amiably	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
brilliant	1
women,	1
surprised	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
do	1
wish	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Willarski	1
bowed	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"One	1
more	1
question,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"which	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
answer	1
in	1
all	1
sincerity--not	1
as	1
a	1
future	1
Mason	1
but	1
as	1
an	1
honest	1
man:	1
have	1
you	1
renounced	1
your	1
former	1
convictions--do	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
God?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
considered.	1
	1
"Yes...	1
yes,	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
God,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case..."	1
began	1
Willarski,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
God,"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
we	1
can	1
go,"	1
said	1
Willarski.	1
"My	1
carriage	1
is	1
at	1
your	1
service."	1
	1
Willarski	1
was	1
silent	1
throughout	1
the	1
drive.	1
To	1
Pierre's	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
must	1
do	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
should	1
answer,	1
Willarski	1
only	1
replied	1
that	1
brothers	1
more	1
worthy	1
than	1
he	1
would	1
test	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
Having	1
entered	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
house	1
where	1
the	1
Lodge	1
had	1
its	1
headquarters,	1
and	1
having	1
ascended	1
a	1
dark	1
staircase,	1
they	1
entered	1
a	1
small	1
well-lit	1
anteroom	1
where	1
they	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
cloaks	1
without	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
servant.	1
From	1
there	1
they	1
passed	1
into	1
another	1
room.	1
A	1
man	1
in	1
strange	1
attire	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Willarski,	1
stepping	1
toward	1
him,	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
French	1
in	1
an	1
undertone	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
wardrobe	1
in	1
which	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
garments	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before.	1
Having	1
taken	1
a	1
kerchief	1
from	1
the	1
cupboard,	1
Willarski	1
bound	1
Pierre's	1
eyes	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
tied	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
knot	1
behind,	1
catching	1
some	1
hairs	1
painfully	1
in	1
the	1
knot.	1
Then	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
face	1
down,	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
led	1
him	1
forward.	1
The	1
hairs	1
tied	1
in	1
the	1
knot	1
hurt	1
Pierre	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
lines	1
of	1
pain	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
shamefaced	1
smile.	1
His	1
huge	1
figure,	1
with	1
arms	1
hanging	1
down	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
puckered,	1
though	1
smiling	1
face,	1
moved	1
after	1
Willarski	1
with	1
uncertain,	1
timid	1
steps.	1
	1
Having	1
led	1
him	1
about	1
ten	1
paces,	1
Willarski	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Whatever	1
happens	1
to	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
must	1
bear	1
it	1
all	1
manfully	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
join	1
our	1
Brotherhood."	1
(Pierre	1
nodded	1
affirmatively.)	1
"When	1
you	1
hear	1
a	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
you	1
will	1
uncover	1
your	1
eyes,"	1
added	1
Willarski.	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
courage	1
and	1
success,"	1
and,	1
pressing	1
Pierre's	1
hand,	1
he	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
Left	1
alone,	1
Pierre	1
went	1
on	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
kerchief,	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
off,	1
but	1
let	1
it	1
drop	1
again.	1
The	1
five	1
minutes	1
spent	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
bandaged	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
an	1
hour.	1
His	1
arms	1
felt	1
numb,	1
his	1
legs	1
almost	1
gave	1
way,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
tired	1
out.	1
He	1
experienced	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
most	1
complex	1
sensations.	1
He	1
felt	1
afraid	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
showing	1
his	1
fear.	1
He	1
felt	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
and	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
revealed	1
to	1
him;	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
felt	1
joyful	1
that	1
the	1
moment	1
had	1
come	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
last	1
start	1
on	1
that	1
path	1
of	1
regeneration	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
actively	1
virtuous	1
life	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
dreaming	1
since	1
he	1
met	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich.	1
Loud	1
knocks	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
the	1
bandage	1
off	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
glanced	1
around	1
him.	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
in	1
black	1
darkness,	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
lamp	1
was	1
burning	1
inside	1
something	1
white.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
nearer	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
lamp	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
black	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
an	1
open	1
book.	1
The	1
book	1
was	1
the	1
Gospel,	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
thing	1
with	1
the	1
lamp	1
inside	1
was	1
a	1
human	1
skull	1
with	1
its	1
cavities	1
and	1
teeth.	1
After	1
reading	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Gospel:	1
"In	1
the	1
beginning	1
was	1
the	1
Word	1
and	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
with	1
God,"	1
Pierre	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
large	1
open	1
box	1
filled	1
with	1
something.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
coffin	1
with	1
bones	1
inside.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
surprised	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
saw.	1
Hoping	1
to	1
enter	1
on	1
an	1
entirely	1
new	1
life	1
quite	1
unlike	1
the	1
old	1
one,	1
he	1
expected	1
everything	1
to	1
be	1
unusual,	1
even	1
more	1
unusual	1
than	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
seeing.	1
A	1
skull,	1
a	1
coffin,	1
the	1
Gospel--it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
even	1
more.	1
Trying	1
to	1
stimulate	1
his	1
emotions	1
he	1
looked	1
around.	1
"God,	1
death,	1
love,	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
of	1
man,"	1
he	1
kept	1
saying	1
to	1
himself,	1
associating	1
these	1
words	1
with	1
vague	1
yet	1
joyful	1
ideas.	1
The	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
someone	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
dim	1
light,	1
to	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
already	1
become	1
accustomed,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
rather	1
short	1
man.	1
Having	1
evidently	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
light	1
into	1
the	1
darkness,	1
the	1
man	1
paused,	1
then	1
moved	1
with	1
cautious	1
steps	1
toward	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
placed	1
on	1
it	1
his	1
small	1
leather-gloved	1
hands.	1
	1
This	1
short	1
man	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
leather	1
apron	1
which	1
covered	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
legs;	1
he	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
necklace	1
above	1
which	1
rose	1
a	1
high	1
white	1
ruffle,	1
outlining	1
his	1
rather	1
long	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
from	1
below.	1
	1
"For	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
hither?"	1
asked	1
the	1
newcomer,	1
turning	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
direction	1
at	1
a	1
slight	1
rustle	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
latter.	1
"Why	1
have	1
you,	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
light,	1
come	1
here?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
seek	1
from	1
us?	1
Wisdom,	1
virtue,	1
enlightenment?"	1
	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
came	1
in,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
awe	1
and	1
veneration	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
in	1
his	1
boyhood	1
at	1
confession;	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
one	1
socially	1
a	1
complete	1
stranger,	1
yet	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
of	1
man.	1
With	1
bated	1
breath	1
and	1
beating	1
heart	1
he	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
(by	1
which	1
name	1
the	1
brother	1
who	1
prepared	1
a	1
seeker	1
for	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
was	1
known).	1
Drawing	1
nearer,	1
he	1
recognized	1
in	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
knew,	1
Smolyaninov,	1
and	1
it	1
mortified	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
newcomer	1
was	1
an	1
acquaintance--he	1
wished	1
him	1
simply	1
a	1
brother	1
and	1
a	1
virtuous	1
instructor.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
a	1
word,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
had	1
to	1
repeat	1
his	1
question.	1
	1
"Yes...	1
I...	1
I...	1
desire	1
regeneration,"	1
Pierre	1
uttered	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Smolyaninov,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
at	1
once:	1
"Have	1
you	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
by	1
which	1
our	1
holy	1
Order	1
will	1
help	1
you	1
to	1
reach	1
your	1
aim?"	1
said	1
he	1
quietly	1
and	1
quickly.	1
	1
"I...	1
hope...	1
for	1
guidance...	1
help...	1
in	1
regeneration,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
and	1
some	1
difficulty	1
in	1
utterance	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
excitement	1
and	1
to	1
being	1
unaccustomed	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
abstract	1
matters	1
in	1
Russian.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
your	1
conception	1
of	1
Freemasonry?"	1
	1
"I	1
imagine	1
that	1
Freemasonry	1
is	1
the	1
fraternity	1
and	1
equality	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
virtuous	1
aims,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
feeling	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
inadequacy	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
for	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
"I	1
imagine..."	1
	1
"Good!"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
quickly,	1
apparently	1
satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
answer.	1
"Have	1
you	1
sought	1
for	1
means	1
of	1
attaining	1
your	1
aim	1
in	1
religion?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
considered	1
it	1
erroneous	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
it,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
so	1
softly	1
that	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
atheist,"	1
answered	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
seeking	1
for	1
truth	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
follow	1
its	1
laws	1
in	1
your	1
life,	1
therefore	1
you	1
seek	1
wisdom	1
and	1
virtue.	1
Is	1
that	1
not	1
so?"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
assented	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
Rhetor	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat,	1
crossed	1
his	1
gloved	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
"Now	1
I	1
must	1
disclose	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
chief	1
aim	1
of	1
our	1
Order,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
if	1
this	1
aim	1
coincides	1
with	1
yours,	1
you	1
may	1
enter	1
our	1
Brotherhood	1
with	1
profit.	1
The	1
first	1
and	1
chief	1
object	1
of	1
our	1
Order,	1
the	1
foundation	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
rests	1
and	1
which	1
no	1
human	1
power	1
can	1
destroy,	1
is	1
the	1
preservation	1
and	1
handing	1
on	1
to	1
posterity	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
important	1
mystery...	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
remotest	1
ages,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
man--a	1
mystery	1
on	1
which	1
perhaps	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
mankind	1
depends.	1
But	1
since	1
this	1
mystery	1
is	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nature	1
that	1
nobody	1
can	1
know	1
or	1
use	1
it	1
unless	1
he	1
be	1
prepared	1
by	1
long	1
and	1
diligent	1
self-purification,	1
not	1
everyone	1
can	1
hope	1
to	1
attain	1
it	1
quickly.	1
Hence	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
secondary	1
aim,	1
that	1
of	1
preparing	1
our	1
members	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
reform	1
their	1
hearts,	1
to	1
purify	1
and	1
enlighten	1
their	1
minds,	1
by	1
means	1
handed	1
on	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
tradition	1
from	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
striven	1
to	1
attain	1
this	1
mystery,	1
and	1
thereby	1
to	1
render	1
them	1
capable	1
of	1
receiving	1
it.	1
	1
"By	1
purifying	1
and	1
regenerating	1
our	1
members	1
we	1
try,	1
thirdly,	1
to	1
improve	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race,	1
offering	1
it	1
in	1
our	1
members	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
piety	1
and	1
virtue,	1
and	1
thereby	1
try	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
might	1
to	1
combat	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
sways	1
the	1
world.	1
Think	1
this	1
over	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
again."	1
	1
"To	1
combat	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
sways	1
the	1
world..."	1
Pierre	1
repeated,	1
and	1
a	1
mental	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
future	1
activity	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
imagined	1
men	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
been	1
a	1
fortnight	1
ago,	1
and	1
he	1
addressed	1
an	1
edifying	1
exhortation	1
to	1
them.	1
He	1
imagined	1
to	1
himself	1
vicious	1
and	1
unfortunate	1
people	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
assist	1
by	1
word	1
and	1
deed,	1
imagined	1
oppressors	1
whose	1
victims	1
he	1
would	1
rescue.	1
Of	1
the	1
three	1
objects	1
mentioned	1
by	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
this	1
last,	1
that	1
of	1
improving	1
mankind,	1
especially	1
appealed	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
important	1
mystery	1
mentioned	1
by	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
though	1
it	1
aroused	1
his	1
curiosity,	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
essential,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
aim,	1
that	1
of	1
purifying	1
and	1
regenerating	1
himself,	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
interest	1
him	1
because	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
felt	1
with	1
delight	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
perfectly	1
cured	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
faults	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
later,	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
returned	1
to	1
inform	1
the	1
seeker	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
virtues,	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
steps	1
of	1
Solomon's	1
temple,	1
which	1
every	1
Freemason	1
should	1
cultivate	1
in	1
himself.	1
These	1
virtues	1
were:	1
1.	1
Discretion,	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
Order.	1
2.	1
Obedience	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
higher	1
ranks	1
in	1
the	1
Order.	1
3.	1
Morality.	1
4.	1
Love	1
of	1
mankind.	1
5.	1
Courage.	1
6.	1
Generosity.	1
7.	1
The	1
love	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
seventh	1
place,	1
try,	1
by	1
the	1
frequent	1
thought	1
of	1
death,"	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
said,	1
"to	1
bring	1
yourself	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
dreaded	1
foe,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
friend	1
that	1
frees	1
the	1
soul	1
grown	1
weary	1
in	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
virtue	1
from	1
this	1
distressful	1
life,	1
and	1
leads	1
it	1
to	1
its	1
place	1
of	1
recompense	1
and	1
peace."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
so,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
when	1
after	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
went	1
away,	1
leaving	1
him	1
to	1
solitary	1
meditation.	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
so,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
life,	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
now	1
gradually	1
opening	1
before	1
me."	1
But	1
five	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
virtues	1
which	1
Pierre	1
recalled,	1
counting	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
fingers,	1
he	1
felt	1
already	1
in	1
his	1
soul:	1
courage,	1
generosity,	1
morality,	1
love	1
of	1
mankind,	1
and	1
especially	1
obedience--which	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
virtue,	1
but	1
a	1
joy.	1
(He	1
now	1
felt	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
lawlessness	1
and	1
to	1
submit	1
his	1
will	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
indubitable	1
truth.)	1
He	1
forgot	1
what	1
the	1
seventh	1
virtue	1
was	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
recall	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
time	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
came	1
back	1
more	1
quickly	1
and	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
firm	1
in	1
his	1
intention	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
ready	1
for	1
everything,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
also	1
inform	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
"that	1
our	1
Order	1
delivers	1
its	1
teaching	1
not	1
in	1
words	1
only	1
but	1
also	1
by	1
other	1
means,	1
which	1
may	1
perhaps	1
have	1
a	1
stronger	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
sincere	1
seeker	1
after	1
wisdom	1
and	1
virtue	1
than	1
mere	1
words.	1
This	1
chamber	1
with	1
what	1
you	1
see	1
therein	1
should	1
already	1
have	1
suggested	1
to	1
your	1
heart,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
sincere,	1
more	1
than	1
words	1
could	1
do.	1
You	1
will	1
perhaps	1
also	1
see	1
in	1
your	1
further	1
initiation	1
a	1
like	1
method	1
of	1
enlightenment.	1
Our	1
Order	1
imitates	1
the	1
ancient	1
societies	1
that	1
explained	1
their	1
teaching	1
by	1
hieroglyphics.	1
A	1
hieroglyph,"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
"is	1
an	1
emblem	1
of	1
something	1
not	1
cognizable	1
by	1
the	1
senses	1
but	1
which	1
possesses	1
qualities	1
resembling	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
symbol."	1
	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
what	1
a	1
hieroglyph	1
was,	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
speak.	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
in	1
silence,	1
feeling	1
from	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
his	1
ordeal	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
begin.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
are	1
resolved,	1
I	1
must	1
begin	1
your	1
initiation,"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
coming	1
closer	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"In	1
token	1
of	1
generosity	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
all	1
your	1
valuables."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
here,"	1
replied	1
Pierre,	1
supposing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
he	1
possessed.	1
	1
"What	1
you	1
have	1
with	1
you:	1
watch,	1
money,	1
rings...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
quickly	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
watch,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
manage	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
wedding	1
ring	1
off	1
his	1
fat	1
finger.	1
When	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done,	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
said:	1
	1
"In	1
token	1
of	1
obedience,	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
undress."	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
coat,	1
waistcoat,	1
and	1
left	1
boot	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
Rhetor's	1
instructions.	1
The	1
Mason	1
drew	1
the	1
shirt	1
back	1
from	1
Pierre's	1
left	1
breast,	1
and	1
stooping	1
down	1
pulled	1
up	1
the	1
left	1
leg	1
of	1
his	1
trousers	1
to	1
above	1
the	1
knee.	1
Pierre	1
hurriedly	1
began	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
right	1
boot	1
also	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
tuck	1
up	1
the	1
other	1
trouser	1
leg	1
to	1
save	1
this	1
stranger	1
the	1
trouble,	1
but	1
the	1
Mason	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
necessary	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
slipper	1
for	1
his	1
left	1
foot.	1
With	1
a	1
childlike	1
smile	1
of	1
embarrassment,	1
doubt,	1
and	1
self-derision,	1
which	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
against	1
his	1
will,	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
hanging	1
down	1
and	1
legs	1
apart,	1
before	1
his	1
brother	1
Rhetor,	1
and	1
awaited	1
his	1
further	1
commands.	1
	1
"And	1
now,	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
candor,	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
reveal	1
to	1
me	1
your	1
chief	1
passion,"	1
said	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
"My	1
passion!	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
so	1
many,"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"That	1
passion	1
which	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
others	1
caused	1
you	1
to	1
waver	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
virtue,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason.	1
	1
Pierre	1
paused,	1
seeking	1
a	1
reply.	1
	1
"Wine?	1
Gluttony?	1
Idleness?	1
Laziness?	1
Irritability?	1
Anger?	1
Women?"	1
He	1
went	1
over	1
his	1
vices	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
not	1
knowing	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
pre-eminence.	1
	1
"Women,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
scarcely	1
audible	1
voice.	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
said	1
nothing	1
after	1
this	1
answer.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
moved	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and,	1
taking	1
the	1
kerchief	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
again	1
bound	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"For	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you--turn	1
all	1
your	1
attention	1
upon	1
yourself,	1
put	1
a	1
bridle	1
on	1
your	1
senses,	1
and	1
seek	1
blessedness,	1
not	1
in	1
passion	1
but	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
heart.	1
The	1
source	1
of	1
blessedness	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
us	1
but	1
within...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
already	1
long	1
been	1
feeling	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
refreshing	1
source	1
of	1
blessedness	1
which	1
now	1
flooded	1
his	1
heart	1
with	1
glad	1
emotion.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
this	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
chamber	1
to	1
fetch	1
Pierre,	1
not	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
but	1
Pierre's	1
sponsor,	1
Willarski,	1
whom	1
he	1
recognized	1
by	1
his	1
voice.	1
To	1
fresh	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
his	1
resolution	1
Pierre	1
replied:	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
agree,"	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
beaming,	1
childlike	1
smile,	1
his	1
fat	1
chest	1
uncovered,	1
stepping	1
unevenly	1
and	1
timidly	1
in	1
one	1
slippered	1
and	1
one	1
booted	1
foot,	1
he	1
advanced,	1
while	1
Willarski	1
held	1
a	1
sword	1
to	1
his	1
bare	1
chest.	1
He	1
was	1
conducted	1
from	1
that	1
room	1
along	1
passages	1
that	1
turned	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
Lodge.	1
Willarski	1
coughed,	1
he	1
was	1
answered	1
by	1
the	1
masonic	1
knock	1
with	1
mallets,	1
the	1
doors	1
opened	1
before	1
them.	1
A	1
bass	1
voice	1
(Pierre	1
was	1
still	1
blindfolded)	1
questioned	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
when	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Then	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
led	1
somewhere	1
still	1
blindfolded,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
along	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
allegories	1
of	1
the	1
toils	1
of	1
his	1
pilgrimage,	1
of	1
holy	1
friendship,	1
of	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Architect	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
courage	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
endure	1
toils	1
and	1
dangers.	1
During	1
these	1
wanderings,	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
now	1
as	1
the	1
"Seeker,"	1
now	1
as	1
the	1
"Sufferer,"	1
and	1
now	1
as	1
the	1
"Postulant,"	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
various	1
knockings	1
with	1
mallets	1
and	1
swords.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
some	1
object	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
hesitation	1
and	1
uncertainty	1
among	1
his	1
conductors.	1
He	1
heard	1
those	1
around	1
him	1
disputing	1
in	1
whispers	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
insisting	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
led	1
along	1
a	1
certain	1
carpet.	1
After	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
something,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
hold	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
compasses	1
to	1
his	1
left	1
breast	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
and	1
to	1
repeat	1
after	1
someone	1
who	1
read	1
aloud	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
fidelity	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Order.	1
The	1
candles	1
were	1
then	1
extinguished	1
and	1
some	1
spirit	1
lighted,	1
as	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
by	1
the	1
smell,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
now	1
see	1
the	1
lesser	1
light.	1
The	1
bandage	1
was	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
eyes	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
faint	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
spirit,	1
Pierre,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saw	1
several	1
men	1
standing	1
before	1
him,	1
wearing	1
aprons	1
like	1
the	1
Rhetor's	1
and	1
holding	1
swords	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
pointed	1
at	1
his	1
breast.	1
Among	1
them	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
white	1
shirt	1
was	1
stained	1
with	1
blood.	1
On	1
seeing	1
this,	1
Pierre	1
moved	1
forward	1
with	1
his	1
breast	1
toward	1
the	1
swords,	1
meaning	1
them	1
to	1
pierce	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
swords	1
were	1
drawn	1
back	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
blindfolded	1
again.	1
	1
"Now	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
the	1
lesser	1
light,"	1
uttered	1
a	1
voice.	1
Then	1
the	1
candles	1
were	1
relit	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
the	1
full	1
light;	1
the	1
bandage	1
was	1
again	1
removed	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
voices	1
said	1
together:	1
"Sic	1
transit	1
gloria	1
mundi."	1
	1
Pierre	1
gradually	1
began	1
to	1
recover	1
himself	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
at	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
it.	1
Round	1
a	1
long	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
black	1
sat	1
some	1
twelve	1
men	1
in	1
garments	1
like	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
seen.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
Pierre	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society.	1
In	1
the	1
President's	1
chair	1
sat	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
cross	1
hanging	1
from	1
his	1
neck.	1
On	1
his	1
right	1
sat	1
the	1
Italian	1
abbe	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
had	1
met	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
two	1
years	1
before.	1
There	1
were	1
also	1
present	1
a	1
very	1
distinguished	1
dignitary	1
and	1
a	1
Swiss	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
tutor	1
at	1
the	1
Kuragins'.	1
All	1
maintained	1
a	1
solemn	1
silence,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
who	1
held	1
a	1
mallet	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
Let	1
into	1
the	1
wall	1
was	1
a	1
star-shaped	1
light.	1
At	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
carpet	1
with	1
various	1
figures	1
worked	1
upon	1
it,	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
something	1
resembling	1
an	1
altar	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
a	1
Testament	1
and	1
a	1
skull.	1
Round	1
it	1
stood	1
seven	1
large	1
candlesticks	1
like	1
those	1
used	1
in	1
churches.	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
brothers	1
led	1
Pierre	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
altar,	1
placed	1
his	1
feet	1
at	1
right	1
angles,	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
lie	1
down,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
prostrate	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
Gates	1
of	1
the	1
Temple.	1
	1
"He	1
must	1
first	1
receive	1
the	1
trowel,"	1
whispered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
brothers.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
hush,	1
please!"	1
said	1
another.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
perplexed,	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
his	1
shortsighted	1
eyes	1
without	1
obeying,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
doubts	1
arose	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
"Where	1
am	1
I?	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
doing?	1
Aren't	1
they	1
laughing	1
at	1
me?	1
Shan't	1
I	1
be	1
ashamed	1
to	1
remember	1
this?"	1
But	1
these	1
doubts	1
only	1
lasted	1
a	1
moment.	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
serious	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
around,	1
remembered	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
through,	1
and	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stop	1
halfway.	1
He	1
was	1
aghast	1
at	1
his	1
hesitation	1
and,	1
trying	1
to	1
arouse	1
his	1
former	1
devotional	1
feeling,	1
prostrated	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
Gates	1
of	1
the	1
Temple.	1
And	1
really,	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
devotion	1
returned	1
to	1
him	1
even	1
more	1
strongly	1
than	1
before.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
there	1
some	1
time,	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
get	1
up,	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
leather	1
apron,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
wore,	1
was	1
put	1
on	1
him:	1
he	1
was	1
given	1
a	1
trowel	1
and	1
three	1
pairs	1
of	1
gloves,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master	1
addressed	1
him.	1
He	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
to	1
stain	1
the	1
whiteness	1
of	1
that	1
apron,	1
which	1
symbolized	1
strength	1
and	1
purity;	1
then	1
of	1
the	1
unexplained	1
trowel,	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
toil	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
cleanse	1
his	1
own	1
heart	1
from	1
vice,	1
and	1
indulgently	1
to	1
smooth	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1
neighbor.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
pair	1
of	1
gloves,	1
a	1
man's,	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
their	1
meaning	1
but	1
must	1
keep	1
them.	1
The	1
second	1
pair	1
of	1
man's	1
gloves	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
wear	1
at	1
the	1
meetings,	1
and	1
finally	1
of	1
the	1
third,	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
women's	1
gloves,	1
he	1
said:	1
"Dear	1
brother,	1
these	1
woman's	1
gloves	1
are	1
intended	1
for	1
you	1
too.	1
Give	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
whom	1
you	1
shall	1
honor	1
most	1
of	1
all.	1
This	1
gift	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
pledge	1
of	1
your	1
purity	1
of	1
heart	1
to	1
her	1
whom	1
you	1
select	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
worthy	1
helpmeet	1
in	1
Masonry."	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
he	1
added:	1
"But	1
beware,	1
dear	1
brother,	1
that	1
these	1
gloves	1
do	1
not	1
deck	1
hands	1
that	1
are	1
unclean."	1
While	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master	1
said	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
he	1
grew	1
embarrassed.	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
grew	1
still	1
more	1
confused,	1
blushed	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
till	1
tears	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
eyes,	1
began	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
uneasily,	1
and	1
an	1
awkward	1
pause	1
followed.	1
	1
This	1
silence	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
who	1
led	1
Pierre	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
rug	1
and	1
began	1
reading	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
manuscript	1
book	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
figures	1
on	1
it:	1
the	1
sun,	1
the	1
moon,	1
a	1
hammer,	1
a	1
plumb	1
line,	1
a	1
trowel,	1
a	1
rough	1
stone	1
and	1
a	1
squared	1
stone,	1
a	1
pillar,	1
three	1
windows,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Then	1
a	1
place	1
was	1
assigned	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
he	1
was	1
shown	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
Lodge,	1
told	1
the	1
password,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
was	1
permitted	1
to	1
sit	1
down.	1
The	1
Grand	1
Master	1
began	1
reading	1
the	1
statutes.	1
They	1
were	1
very	1
long,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
from	1
joy,	1
agitation,	1
and	1
embarrassment,	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
read.	1
He	1
managed	1
to	1
follow	1
only	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
these	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"In	1
our	1
temples	1
we	1
recognize	1
no	1
other	1
distinctions,"	1
read	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master,	1
"but	1
those	1
between	1
virtue	1
and	1
vice.	1
Beware	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
distinctions	1
which	1
may	1
infringe	1
equality.	1
Fly	1
to	1
a	1
brother's	1
aid	1
whoever	1
he	1
may	1
be,	1
exhort	1
him	1
who	1
goeth	1
astray,	1
raise	1
him	1
that	1
falleth,	1
never	1
bear	1
malice	1
or	1
enmity	1
toward	1
thy	1
brother.	1
Be	1
kindly	1
and	1
courteous.	1
Kindle	1
in	1
all	1
hearts	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
virtue.	1
Share	1
thy	1
happiness	1
with	1
thy	1
neighbor,	1
and	1
may	1
envy	1
never	1
dim	1
the	1
purity	1
of	1
that	1
bliss.	1
Forgive	1
thy	1
enemy,	1
do	1
not	1
avenge	1
thyself	1
except	1
by	1
doing	1
him	1
good.	1
Thus	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
highest	1
law	1
thou	1
shalt	1
regain	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
dignity	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
lost."	1
	1
He	1
finished	1
and,	1
getting	1
up,	1
embraced	1
and	1
kissed	1
Pierre,	1
who,	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
looked	1
round	1
him,	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
congratulations	1
and	1
greetings	1
from	1
acquaintances	1
that	1
met	1
him	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
He	1
acknowledged	1
no	1
acquaintances	1
but	1
saw	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
only	1
brothers,	1
and	1
burned	1
with	1
impatience	1
to	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
Grand	1
Master	1
rapped	1
with	1
his	1
mallet.	1
All	1
the	1
Masons	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
places,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
read	1
an	1
exhortation	1
on	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
humility.	1
	1
The	1
Grand	1
Master	1
proposed	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
duty	1
should	1
be	1
performed,	1
and	1
the	1
distinguished	1
dignitary	1
who	1
bore	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
"Collector	1
of	1
Alms"	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
brothers.	1
Pierre	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
subscribe	1
all	1
he	1
had,	1
but	1
fearing	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
look	1
like	1
pride	1
subscribed	1
the	1
same	1
amount	1
as	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
The	1
meeting	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
on	1
reaching	1
home	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
returned	1
from	1
a	1
long	1
journey	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
dozens	1
of	1
years,	1
had	1
become	1
completely	1
changed,	1
and	1
had	1
quite	1
left	1
behind	1
his	1
former	1
habits	1
and	1
way	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
into	1
the	1
Lodge,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
home	1
reading	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
fathom	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
Square,	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
which	1
symbolized	1
God,	1
another	1
moral	1
things,	1
a	1
third	1
physical	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
these.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
attention	1
wandered	1
from	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
the	1
Square	1
and	1
he	1
formed	1
in	1
imagination	1
a	1
new	1
plan	1
of	1
life.	1
On	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
Lodge,	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
a	1
rumor	1
of	1
his	1
duel	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wiser	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
Petersburg.	1
Pierre	1
proposed	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
estates	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
there	1
attending	1
to	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
serfs.	1
He	1
was	1
joyfully	1
planning	1
this	1
new	1
life,	1
when	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
suddenly	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
in	1
Moscow?	1
Why	1
have	1
you	1
quarreled	1
with	1
Helene,	1
mon	1
cher?	1
You	1
are	1
under	1
a	1
delusion,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
as	1
he	1
entered.	1
"I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
positively	1
that	1
Helene	1
is	1
as	1
innocent	1
before	1
you	1
as	1
Christ	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
Jews."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
simply	1
come	1
straight	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
friend?	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
understand	1
it	1
all,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"You	1
behaved	1
as	1
becomes	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
values	1
his	1
honor,	1
perhaps	1
too	1
hastily,	1
but	1
we	1
won't	1
go	1
into	1
that.	1
But	1
consider	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
placing	1
her	1
and	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
society,	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
court,"	1
he	1
added,	1
lowering	1
his	1
voice.	1
"She	1
is	1
living	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
here.	1
Remember,	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
Pierre's	1
arm	1
downwards,	1
"it	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
misunderstanding.	1
I	1
expect	1
you	1
feel	1
it	1
so	1
yourself.	1
Let	1
us	1
write	1
her	1
a	1
letter	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
she'll	1
come	1
here	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
explained,	1
or	1
else,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
it's	1
quite	1
likely	1
you'll	1
have	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
it."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
gave	1
Pierre	1
a	1
significant	1
look.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
from	1
reliable	1
sources	1
that	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
is	1
taking	1
a	1
keen	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
affair.	1
You	1
know	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
gracious	1
to	1
Helene."	1
	1
Pierre	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
speak,	1
but,	1
on	1
one	1
hand,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
feared	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
decided	1
refusal	1
and	1
disagreement	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
answer	1
his	1
father-in-law.	1
Moreover,	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
masonic	1
statutes,	1
"be	1
kindly	1
and	1
courteous,"	1
recurred	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
blinked,	1
went	1
red,	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again,	1
struggling	1
with	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
thing	1
in	1
life--to	1
say	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
to	1
a	1
man's	1
face,	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
the	1
other,	1
whoever	1
he	1
might	1
be,	1
did	1
not	1
expect.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
submitting	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
tone	1
of	1
careless	1
self-assurance	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
withstand	1
it	1
now,	1
but	1
he	1
also	1
felt	1
that	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
now	1
his	1
future	1
depended--whether	1
he	1
would	1
follow	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
road,	1
or	1
that	1
new	1
path	1
so	1
attractively	1
shown	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
Masons,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
firmly	1
believed	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
reborn	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
life.	1
	1
"Now,	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
playfully,	1
"say	1
'yes,'	1
and	1
I'll	1
write	1
to	1
her	1
myself,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
kill	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf."	1
	1
But	1
before	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
playful	1
speech,	1
Pierre,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
fury	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
like	1
his	1
father,	1
muttered	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
	1
"Prince,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
here.	1
Go,	1
please	1
go!"	1
And	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
"Go!"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
amazed	1
at	1
himself	1
and	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
confusion	1
and	1
fear	1
that	1
showed	1
itself	1
on	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
face.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
Are	1
you	1
ill?"	1
	1
"Go!"	1
the	1
quivering	1
voice	1
repeated.	1
And	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
receiving	1
any	1
explanation.	1
	1
A	1
week	1
later,	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
taken	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
friends,	1
the	1
Masons,	1
and	1
leaving	1
large	1
sums	1
of	1
money	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
alms,	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
estates.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
The	1
duel	1
between	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
hushed	1
up	1
and,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
severity	1
regarding	1
duels	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
neither	1
the	1
principals	1
nor	1
their	1
seconds	1
suffered	1
for	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
duel,	1
confirmed	1
by	1
Pierre's	1
rupture	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
was	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
society.	1
Pierre	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
regarded	1
with	1
patronizing	1
condescension	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son,	1
and	1
petted	1
and	1
extolled	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
match	1
in	1
Russia,	1
had	1
sunk	1
greatly	1
in	1
the	1
esteem	1
of	1
society	1
after	1
his	1
marriage--	1
when	1
the	1
marriageable	1
daughters	1
and	1
their	1
mothers	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
hope	1
from	1
him--especially	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
wish,	1
to	1
court	1
society's	1
favor.	1
Now	1
he	1
alone	1
was	1
blamed	1
for	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
he	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
insanely	1
jealous	1
and	1
subject	1
like	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
fits	1
of	1
bloodthirsty	1
rage.	1
And	1
when	1
after	1
Pierre's	1
departure	1
Helene	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
she	1
was	1
received	1
by	1
all	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
not	1
only	1
cordially,	1
but	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
deference	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
misfortune.	1
When	1
conversation	1
turned	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
Helene	1
assumed	1
a	1
dignified	1
expression,	1
which	1
with	1
characteristic	1
tact	1
she	1
had	1
acquired	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
its	1
significance.	1
This	1
expression	1
suggested	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
resolved	1
to	1
endure	1
her	1
troubles	1
uncomplainingly	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
a	1
cross	1
laid	1
upon	1
her	1
by	1
God.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
expressed	1
his	1
opinion	1
more	1
openly.	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
when	1
Pierre	1
was	1
mentioned	1
and,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
forehead,	1
remarked:	1
	1
"A	1
bit	1
touched--I	1
always	1
said	1
so."	1
	1
"I	1
said	1
from	1
the	1
first,"	1
declared	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
referring	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
"I	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
before	1
anyone	1
else"	1
(she	1
insisted	1
on	1
her	1
priority)	1
"that	1
that	1
senseless	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
spoiled	1
by	1
the	1
depraved	1
ideas	1
of	1
these	1
days.	1
I	1
said	1
so	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
everybody	1
was	1
in	1
raptures	1
about	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad,	1
and	1
when,	1
if	1
you	1
remember,	1
he	1
posed	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Marat	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
soirees.	1
And	1
how	1
has	1
it	1
ended?	1
I	1
was	1
against	1
this	1
marriage	1
even	1
then	1
and	1
foretold	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
happened."	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
continued	1
to	1
give	1
on	1
free	1
evenings	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
soirees	1
as	1
before--such	1
as	1
she	1
alone	1
had	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
arranging--at	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
"the	1
cream	1
of	1
really	1
good	1
society,	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
the	1
intellectual	1
essence	1
of	1
Petersburg,"	1
as	1
she	1
herself	1
put	1
it.	1
Besides	1
this	1
refined	1
selection	1
of	1
society	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
receptions	1
were	1
also	1
distinguished	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
always	1
presented	1
some	1
new	1
and	1
interesting	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
visitors	1
and	1
that	1
nowhere	1
else	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
political	1
thermometer	1
of	1
legitimate	1
Petersburg	1
court	1
society	1
so	1
dearly	1
and	1
distinctly	1
indicated.	1
	1
Toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
1806,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
sad	1
details	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army	1
at	1
Jena	1
and	1
Auerstadt	1
and	1
the	1
surrender	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
Prussian	1
fortresses	1
had	1
been	1
received,	1
when	1
our	1
troops	1
had	1
already	1
entered	1
Prussia	1
and	1
our	1
second	1
war	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
beginning,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
gave	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
soirees.	1
The	1
"cream	1
of	1
really	1
good	1
society"	1
consisted	1
of	1
the	1
fascinating	1
Helene,	1
forsaken	1
by	1
her	1
husband,	1
Mortemart,	1
the	1
delightful	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
Vienna,	1
two	1
diplomatists,	1
the	1
old	1
aunt,	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
referred	1
to	1
in	1
that	1
drawing	1
room	1
as	1
"a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
merit"	1
(un	1
homme	1
de	1
beaucoup	1
de	1
merite),	1
a	1
newly	1
appointed	1
maid	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
several	1
other	1
less	1
noteworthy	1
persons.	1
	1
The	1
novelty	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
was	1
setting	1
before	1
her	1
guests	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
as	1
a	1
special	1
messenger	1
from	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army	1
and	1
was	1
aide-de-camp	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
personage.	1
	1
The	1
temperature	1
shown	1
by	1
the	1
political	1
thermometer	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
this:	1
	1
"Whatever	1
the	1
European	1
sovereigns	1
and	1
commanders	1
may	1
do	1
to	1
countenance	1
Bonaparte,	1
and	1
to	1
cause	1
me,	1
and	1
us	1
in	1
general,	1
annoyance	1
and	1
mortification,	1
our	1
opinion	1
of	1
Bonaparte	1
cannot	1
alter.	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
express	1
our	1
sincere	1
views	1
on	1
that	1
subject,	1
and	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
and	1
others:	1
'So	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you.	1
Tu	1
l'as	1
voulu,	1
George	1
Dandin,'	1
that's	1
all	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
it!"	1
	1
When	1
Boris,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
guests,	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
had	1
assembled,	1
and	1
the	1
conversation,	1
guided	1
by	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
was	1
about	1
our	1
diplomatic	1
relations	1
with	1
Austria	1
and	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
an	1
alliance	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
Boris,	1
grown	1
more	1
manly	1
and	1
looking	1
fresh,	1
rosy	1
and	1
self-possessed,	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
elegantly	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
an	1
aide-de-	1
camp	1
and	1
was	1
duly	1
conducted	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
respects	1
to	1
the	1
aunt	1
and	1
then	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
circle.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
shriveled	1
hand	1
to	1
kiss	1
and	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
several	1
persons	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
whispered	1
description	1
of	1
each.	1
	1
"Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
Kuragin,	1
M.	1
Krug,	1
the	1
charge	1
d'affaires	1
from	1
Copenhagen--a	1
profound	1
intellect,"	1
and	1
simply,	1
"Mr.	1
Shitov--a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
merit"--this	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
usually	1
so	1
described.	1
	1
Thanks	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
efforts,	1
his	1
own	1
tastes,	1
and	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
his	1
reserved	1
nature,	1
Boris	1
had	1
managed	1
during	1
his	1
service	1
to	1
place	1
himself	1
very	1
advantageously.	1
He	1
was	1
aide-de-camp	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
personage,	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
mission	1
to	1
Prussia,	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
there	1
as	1
a	1
special	1
messenger.	1
He	1
had	1
become	1
thoroughly	1
conversant	1
with	1
that	1
unwritten	1
code	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
pleased	1
at	1
Olmutz	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
which	1
an	1
ensign	1
might	1
rank	1
incomparably	1
higher	1
than	1
a	1
general,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
which	1
what	1
was	1
needed	1
for	1
success	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
not	1
effort	1
or	1
work,	1
or	1
courage,	1
or	1
perseverance,	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
can	1
grant	1
rewards,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
often	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
his	1
success	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
inability	1
of	1
others	1
to	1
understand	1
these	1
things.	1
In	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
discovery	1
his	1
whole	1
manner	1
of	1
life,	1
all	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
old	1
friends,	1
all	1
his	1
plans	1
for	1
his	1
future,	1
were	1
completely	1
altered.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
rich,	1
but	1
would	1
spend	1
his	1
last	1
groat	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
dressed	1
than	1
others,	1
and	1
would	1
rather	1
deprive	1
himself	1
of	1
many	1
pleasures	1
than	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
a	1
shabby	1
equipage	1
or	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
uniform.	1
He	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
and	1
sought	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
only	1
those	1
above	1
him	1
in	1
position	1
and	1
who	1
could	1
therefore	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
liked	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
despised	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
childish	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
army.	1
To	1
be	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
considered	1
an	1
important	1
step	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
understood	1
his	1
role,	1
letting	1
his	1
hostess	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
whatever	1
interest	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
offer.	1
He	1
himself	1
carefully	1
scanned	1
each	1
face,	1
appraising	1
the	1
possibilities	1
of	1
establishing	1
intimacy	1
with	1
each	1
of	1
those	1
present,	1
and	1
the	1
advantages	1
that	1
might	1
accrue.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
seat	1
indicated	1
to	1
him	1
beside	1
the	1
fair	1
Helene	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
conversation.	1
	1
"Vienna	1
considers	1
the	1
bases	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
treaty	1
so	1
unattainable	1
that	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
continuity	1
of	1
most	1
brilliant	1
successes	1
would	1
secure	1
them,	1
and	1
she	1
doubts	1
the	1
means	1
we	1
have	1
of	1
gaining	1
them.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
actual	1
phrase	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
Vienna	1
cabinet,"	1
said	1
the	1
Danish	1
charge	1
d'affaires.	1
	1
"The	1
doubt	1
is	1
flattering,"	1
said	1
"the	1
man	1
of	1
profound	1
intellect,"	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile.	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
distinguish	1
between	1
the	1
Vienna	1
cabinet	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Austria,"	1
said	1
Mortemart.	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Austria	1
can	1
never	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
cabinet	1
that	1
says	1
it."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
vicomte,"	1
put	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"L'Urope"	1
(for	1
some	1
reason	1
she	1
called	1
it	1
Urope	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
a	1
specially	1
refined	1
French	1
pronunciation	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
allow	1
herself	1
when	1
conversing	1
with	1
a	1
Frenchman),	1
"L'Urope	1
ne	1
sera	1
jamais	1
notre	1
alliee	1
sincere."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Europe	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
our	1
sincere	1
ally."	1
	1
After	1
that	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
courage	1
and	1
firmness	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
draw	1
Boris	1
into	1
the	1
conversation.	1
	1
Boris	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
speakers,	1
awaiting	1
his	1
turn,	1
but	1
managed	1
meanwhile	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
repeatedly	1
at	1
his	1
neighbor,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene,	1
whose	1
eyes	1
several	1
times	1
met	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
handsome	1
young	1
aide-de-camp	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Speaking	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Prussia,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
very	1
naturally	1
asked	1
Boris	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
about	1
his	1
journey	1
to	1
Glogau	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
state	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army.	1
Boris,	1
speaking	1
with	1
deliberation,	1
told	1
them	1
in	1
pure,	1
correct	1
French	1
many	1
interesting	1
details	1
about	1
the	1
armies	1
and	1
the	1
court,	1
carefully	1
abstaining	1
from	1
expressing	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
about	1
the	1
facts	1
he	1
was	1
recounting.	1
For	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
engrossed	1
the	1
general	1
attention,	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
novelty	1
she	1
had	1
served	1
up	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
pleasure	1
by	1
all	1
her	1
visitors.	1
The	1
greatest	1
attention	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
Boris'	1
narrative	1
was	1
shown	1
by	1
Helene.	1
She	1
asked	1
him	1
several	1
questions	1
about	1
his	1
journey	1
and	1
seemed	1
greatly	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
smile.	1
	1
"You	1
absolutely	1
must	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
me,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
implied	1
that,	1
for	1
certain	1
considerations	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
of,	1
this	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary.	1
	1
"On	1
Tuesday	1
between	1
eight	1
and	1
nine.	1
It	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
great	1
pleasure."	1
	1
Boris	1
promised	1
to	1
fulfill	1
her	1
wish	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
her,	1
when	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
called	1
him	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
that	1
her	1
aunt	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
her	1
husband,	1
of	1
course?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
indicating	1
Helene	1
with	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
gesture.	1
"Ah,	1
she	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
charming	1
woman!	1
Don't	1
mention	1
him	1
before	1
her--please	1
don't!	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
painful	1
for	1
her!"	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
When	1
Boris	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
had	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
company.	1
	1
Bending	1
forward	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
he	1
said:	1
"Le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse!"	1
and	1
having	1
said	1
this	1
laughed.	1
Everyone	1
turned	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
"Le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse?"	1
Hippolyte	1
said	1
interrogatively,	1
again	1
laughing,	1
and	1
then	1
calmly	1
and	1
seriously	1
sat	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
on,	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
decided	1
to	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
how	1
at	1
Potsdam	1
the	1
impious	1
Bonaparte	1
had	1
stolen	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Frederick	1
the	1
Great.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Frederick	1
the	1
Great	1
which	1
I..."	1
she	1
began,	1
but	1
Hippolyte	1
interrupted	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse..."	1
and	1
again,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
all	1
turned	1
toward	1
him,	1
excused	1
himself	1
and	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
frowned.	1
Mortemart,	1
Hippolyte's	1
friend,	1
addressed	1
him	1
firmly.	1
	1
"Come	1
now,	1
what	1
about	1
your	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse?"	1
	1
Hippolyte	1
laughed	1
as	1
if	1
ashamed	1
of	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
nothing.	1
I	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
say..."	1
(he	1
wanted	1
to	1
repeat	1
a	1
joke	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
Vienna	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
trying	1
all	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
get	1
in)	1
"I	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
wrong	1
to	1
fight	1
pour	1
le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse!"	1
	1
Boris	1
smiled	1
circumspectly,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
as	1
ironical	1
or	1
appreciative	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
joke	1
was	1
received.	1
Everybody	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Your	1
joke	1
is	1
too	1
bad,	1
it's	1
witty	1
but	1
unjust,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
shaking	1
her	1
little	1
shriveled	1
finger	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
not	1
fighting	1
pour	1
le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse,	1
but	1
for	1
right	1
principles.	1
Oh,	1
that	1
wicked	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte!"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
did	1
not	1
flag	1
all	1
evening	1
and	1
turned	1
chiefly	1
on	1
the	1
political	1
news.	1
It	1
became	1
particularly	1
animated	1
toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
the	1
rewards	1
bestowed	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
were	1
mentioned.	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
N--	1
N--	1
received	1
a	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
the	1
portrait	1
last	1
year?"	1
said	1
"the	1
man	1
of	1
profound	1
intellect."	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
S--	1
S--	1
get	1
the	1
same	1
distinction?"	1
	1
"Pardon	1
me!	1
A	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
portrait	1
is	1
a	1
reward	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
distinction,"	1
said	1
the	1
diplomatist--"a	1
gift,	1
rather."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
precedents,	1
I	1
may	1
mention	1
Schwarzenberg."	1
	1
"It's	1
impossible,"	1
replied	1
another.	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
bet?	1
The	1
ribbon	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
is	1
a	1
different	1
matter...."	1
	1
When	1
everybody	1
rose	1
to	1
go,	1
Helene	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
very	1
little	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
again	1
turned	1
to	1
Boris,	1
asking	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
caressing	1
significant	1
command	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
on	1
Tuesday.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
me,"	1
she	1
said,	1
turning	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
toward	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sad	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
her	1
exalted	1
patroness,	1
supported	1
Helene's	1
wish.	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
some	1
words	1
Boris	1
had	1
spoken	1
that	1
evening	1
about	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army,	1
Helene	1
had	1
suddenly	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
promise	1
to	1
explain	1
that	1
necessity	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
on	1
Tuesday.	1
	1
But	1
on	1
Tuesday	1
evening,	1
having	1
come	1
to	1
Helene's	1
splendid	1
salon,	1
Boris	1
received	1
no	1
clear	1
explanation	1
of	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come.	1
There	1
were	1
other	1
guests	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
talked	1
little	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
only	1
as	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
taking	1
leave	1
said	1
unexpectedly	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
with	1
a	1
strangely	1
unsmiling	1
face:	1
"Come	1
to	1
dinner	1
tomorrow...	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
You	1
must	1
come....	1
Come!"	1
	1
During	1
that	1
stay	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
Boris	1
became	1
an	1
intimate	1
in	1
the	1
countess'	1
house.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
war	1
was	1
flaming	1
up	1
and	1
nearing	1
the	1
Russian	1
frontier.	1
Everywhere	1
one	1
heard	1
curses	1
on	1
Bonaparte,	1
"the	1
enemy	1
of	1
mankind."	1
Militiamen	1
and	1
recruits	1
were	1
being	1
enrolled	1
in	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
war	1
came	1
contradictory	1
news,	1
false	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
therefore	1
variously	1
interpreted.	1
The	1
life	1
of	1
old	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
greatly	1
changed	1
since	1
1805.	1
	1
In	1
1806	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
made	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
eight	1
commanders	1
in	1
chief	1
then	1
appointed	1
to	1
supervise	1
the	1
enrollment	1
decreed	1
throughout	1
Russia.	1
Despite	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
age,	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
particularly	1
noticeable	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
refuse	1
a	1
duty	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself,	1
and	1
this	1
fresh	1
opportunity	1
for	1
action	1
gave	1
him	1
new	1
energy	1
and	1
strength.	1
He	1
was	1
continually	1
traveling	1
through	1
the	1
three	1
provinces	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
was	1
pedantic	1
in	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
his	1
duties,	1
severe	1
to	1
cruel	1
with	1
his	1
subordinates,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
everything	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
himself.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
ceased	1
taking	1
lessons	1
in	1
mathematics	1
from	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
with	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
and	1
little	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
(as	1
his	1
grandfather	1
called	1
him).	1
The	1
baby	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
lived	1
with	1
his	1
wet	1
nurse	1
and	1
nurse	1
Savishna	1
in	1
the	1
late	1
princess'	1
rooms	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
nursery,	1
taking	1
a	1
mother's	1
place	1
to	1
her	1
little	1
nephew	1
as	1
best	1
she	1
could.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
too,	1
seemed	1
passionately	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
boy,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
often	1
deprived	1
herself	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
friend	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
dandling	1
the	1
little	1
angel--as	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
nephew--and	1
playing	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
Near	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
chapel	1
over	1
the	1
tomb	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
chapel	1
was	1
a	1
marble	1
monument	1
brought	1
from	1
Italy,	1
representing	1
an	1
angel	1
with	1
outspread	1
wings	1
ready	1
to	1
fly	1
upwards.	1
The	1
angel's	1
upper	1
lip	1
was	1
slightly	1
raised	1
as	1
though	1
about	1
to	1
smile,	1
and	1
once	1
on	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chapel	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
admitted	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
that	1
the	1
angel's	1
face	1
reminded	1
them	1
strangely	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
But	1
what	1
was	1
still	1
stranger,	1
though	1
of	1
this	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
the	1
sculptor	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
angel's	1
face,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
read	1
the	1
same	1
mild	1
reproach	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
dead	1
wife:	1
"Ah,	1
why	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
this	1
to	1
me?"	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
return	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
made	1
over	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
large	1
estate,	1
Bogucharovo,	1
about	1
twenty-five	1
miles	1
from	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
Partly	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
depressing	1
memories	1
associated	1
with	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
partly	1
because	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
feel	1
equal	1
to	1
bearing	1
with	1
his	1
father's	1
peculiarities,	1
and	1
partly	1
because	1
he	1
needed	1
solitude,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
Bogucharovo,	1
began	1
building	1
and	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
there.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
Austerlitz	1
campaign	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
continue	1
his	1
military	1
service,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
war	1
recommenced	1
and	1
everybody	1
had	1
to	1
serve,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
post	1
under	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
recruitment	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
avoid	1
active	1
service.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
changed	1
roles	1
since	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1805.	1
The	1
old	1
man,	1
roused	1
by	1
activity,	1
expected	1
the	1
best	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
new	1
campaign,	1
while	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
taking	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
secretly	1
regretting	1
this,	1
saw	1
only	1
the	1
dark	1
side.	1
	1
On	1
February	1
26,	1
1807,	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
set	1
off	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
circuits.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
remained	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
as	1
usual	1
during	1
his	1
father's	1
absence.	1
Little	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
unwell	1
for	1
four	1
days.	1
The	1
coachman	1
who	1
had	1
driven	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
town	1
returned	1
bringing	1
papers	1
and	1
letters	1
for	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Not	1
finding	1
the	1
young	1
prince	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
the	1
valet	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
letters	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
apartments,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
there.	1
He	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
please,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
Petrusha	1
has	1
brought	1
some	1
papers,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
nursemaids	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
child's	1
little	1
chair	1
while,	1
frowning	1
and	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands,	1
he	1
poured	1
drops	1
from	1
a	1
medicine	1
bottle	1
into	1
a	1
wineglass	1
half	1
full	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
said	1
crossly,	1
and,	1
his	1
hand	1
shaking	1
unintentionally,	1
he	1
poured	1
too	1
many	1
drops	1
into	1
the	1
glass.	1
He	1
threw	1
the	1
mixture	1
onto	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
more	1
water.	1
The	1
maid	1
brought	1
it.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
child's	1
cot,	1
two	1
boxes,	1
two	1
armchairs,	1
a	1
table,	1
a	1
child's	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
sitting.	1
The	1
curtains	1
were	1
drawn,	1
and	1
a	1
single	1
candle	1
was	1
burning	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
screened	1
by	1
a	1
bound	1
music	1
book	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
cot.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
addressing	1
her	1
brother	1
from	1
beside	1
the	1
cot	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
standing,	1
"better	1
wait	1
a	1
bit...	1
later..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
leave	1
off,	1
you	1
always	1
talk	1
nonsense	1
and	1
keep	1
putting	1
things	1
off--	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
it!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
an	1
exasperated	1
whisper,	1
evidently	1
meaning	1
to	1
wound	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,	1
really...	1
it's	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
wake	1
him...	1
he's	1
asleep,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
entreaty.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
bed,	1
wineglass	1
in	1
hand.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
we'd	1
really	1
better	1
not	1
wake	1
him,"	1
he	1
said	1
hesitating.	1
	1
"As	1
you	1
please...	1
really...	1
I	1
think	1
so...	1
but	1
as	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
evidently	1
intimidated	1
and	1
confused	1
that	1
her	1
opinion	1
had	1
prevailed.	1
She	1
drew	1
her	1
brother's	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
was	1
calling	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
night	1
that	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
slept,	1
watching	1
the	1
boy	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
fever.	1
These	1
last	1
days,	1
mistrusting	1
their	1
household	1
doctor	1
and	1
expecting	1
another	1
for	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
town,	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
trying	1
first	1
one	1
remedy	1
and	1
then	1
another.	1
Worn	1
out	1
by	1
sleeplessness	1
and	1
anxiety	1
they	1
threw	1
their	1
burden	1
of	1
sorrow	1
on	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
reproached	1
and	1
disputed	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
	1
"Petrusha	1
has	1
come	1
with	1
papers	1
from	1
your	1
father,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
maid.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
"Devil	1
take	1
them!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
and	1
after	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
verbal	1
instructions	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
sent	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
correspondence	1
and	1
his	1
father's	1
letter,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
"Well?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Still	1
the	1
same.	1
Wait,	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake.	1
Karl	1
Ivanich	1
always	1
says	1
that	1
sleep	1
is	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
anything,"	1
whispered	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
felt	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
burning	1
hot.	1
	1
"Confound	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
Karl	1
Ivanich!"	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
glass	1
with	1
the	1
drops	1
and	1
again	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cot.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
don't!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
scowled	1
at	1
her	1
angrily	1
though	1
also	1
with	1
suffering	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
stooped	1
glass	1
in	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
infant.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
wish	1
it,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
beg	1
you--give	1
it	1
him!"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
shrugged	1
her	1
shoulders	1
but	1
took	1
the	1
glass	1
submissively	1
and	1
calling	1
the	1
nurse	1
began	1
giving	1
the	1
medicine.	1
The	1
child	1
screamed	1
hoarsely.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
winced	1
and,	1
clutching	1
his	1
head,	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
	1
He	1
still	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
letters	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
Opening	1
them	1
mechanically	1
he	1
began	1
reading.	1
The	1
old	1
prince,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
using	1
abbreviations,	1
wrote	1
in	1
his	1
large	1
elongated	1
hand	1
on	1
blue	1
paper	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
Have	1
just	1
this	1
moment	1
received	1
by	1
special	1
messenger	1
very	1
joyful	1
news--if	1
it's	1
not	1
false.	1
Bennigsen	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
obtained	1
a	1
complete	1
victory	1
over	1
Buonaparte	1
at	1
Eylau.	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
everyone	1
is	1
rejoicing,	1
and	1
the	1
rewards	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
are	1
innumerable.	1
Though	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
German--I	1
congratulate	1
him!	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
commander	1
at	1
Korchevo--a	1
certain	1
Khandrikov--is	1
up	1
to;	1
till	1
now	1
the	1
additional	1
men	1
and	1
provisions	1
have	1
not	1
arrived.	1
Gallop	1
off	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
say	1
I'll	1
have	1
his	1
head	1
off	1
if	1
everything	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
week.	1
Have	1
received	1
another	1
letter	1
about	1
the	1
Preussisch-Eylau	1
battle	1
from	1
Petenka--he	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
it--and	1
it's	1
all	1
true.	1
When	1
mischief-makers	1
don't	1
meddle	1
even	1
a	1
German	1
beats	1
Buonaparte.	1
He	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
fleeing	1
in	1
great	1
disorder.	1
Mind	1
you	1
gallop	1
off	1
to	1
Korchevo	1
without	1
delay	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
instructions!	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sighed	1
and	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
another	1
envelope.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
closely	1
written	1
letter	1
of	1
two	1
sheets	1
from	1
Bilibin.	1
He	1
folded	1
it	1
up	1
without	1
reading	1
it	1
and	1
reread	1
his	1
father's	1
letter,	1
ending	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Gallop	1
off	1
to	1
Korchevo	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
instructions!"	1
	1
"No,	1
pardon	1
me,	1
I	1
won't	1
go	1
now	1
till	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
better,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
still	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
cot,	1
gently	1
rocking	1
the	1
baby.	1
	1
"Ah	1
yes,	1
and	1
what	1
else	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
that's	1
unpleasant?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
recalling	1
his	1
father's	1
letter.	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
have	1
gained	1
a	1
victory	1
over	1
Bonaparte,	1
just	1
when	1
I'm	1
not	1
serving.	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
he's	1
always	1
poking	1
fun	1
at	1
me....	1
Ah,	1
well!	1
Let	1
him!"	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
reading	1
Bilibin's	1
letter	1
which	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
French.	1
He	1
read	1
without	1
understanding	1
half	1
of	1
it,	1
read	1
only	1
to	1
forget,	1
if	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
too	1
long	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
so	1
painfully	1
to	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
all	1
else.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Bilibin	1
was	1
now	1
at	1
army	1
headquarters	1
in	1
a	1
diplomatic	1
capacity,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
wrote	1
in	1
French	1
and	1
used	1
French	1
jests	1
and	1
French	1
idioms,	1
he	1
described	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
with	1
a	1
fearless	1
self-censure	1
and	1
self-	1
derision	1
genuinely	1
Russian.	1
Bilibin	1
wrote	1
that	1
the	1
obligation	1
of	1
diplomatic	1
discretion	1
tormented	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
a	1
reliable	1
correspondent	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
bile	1
he	1
had	1
accumulated	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
army.	1
The	1
letter	1
was	1
old,	1
having	1
been	1
written	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
at	1
Preussisch-	1
Eylau.	1
	1
"Since	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
brilliant	1
success	1
at	1
Austerlitz,"	1
wrote	1
Bilibin,	1
"as	1
you	1
know,	1
my	1
dear	1
prince,	1
I	1
never	1
leave	1
headquarters.	1
I	1
have	1
certainly	1
acquired	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
war,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
me;	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
during	1
these	1
last	1
three	1
months	1
is	1
incredible.	1
	1
"I	1
begin	1
ab	1
ovo.	1
'The	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race,'	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
attacks	1
the	1
Prussians.	1
The	1
Prussians	1
are	1
our	1
faithful	1
allies	1
who	1
have	1
only	1
betrayed	1
us	1
three	1
times	1
in	1
three	1
years.	1
We	1
take	1
up	1
their	1
cause,	1
but	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
that	1
'the	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race'	1
pays	1
no	1
heed	1
to	1
our	1
fine	1
speeches	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
rude	1
and	1
savage	1
way	1
throws	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
Prussians	1
without	1
giving	1
them	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
parade	1
they	1
had	1
begun,	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
twists	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
he	1
breaks	1
them	1
to	1
smithereens	1
and	1
installs	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
at	1
Potsdam.	1
	1
"'I	1
most	1
ardently	1
desire,'	1
writes	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
to	1
Bonaparte,	1
'that	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
should	1
be	1
received	1
and	1
treated	1
in	1
my	1
palace	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
agreeable	1
to	1
yourself,	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
circumstances	1
allowed,	1
I	1
have	1
hastened	1
to	1
take	1
all	1
steps	1
to	1
that	1
end.	1
May	1
I	1
have	1
succeeded!'	1
The	1
Prussian	1
generals	1
pride	1
themselves	1
on	1
being	1
polite	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
their	1
arms	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
demand.	1
	1
"The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
garrison	1
at	1
Glogau,	1
with	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men,	1
asks	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
summoned	1
to	1
surrender....	1
All	1
this	1
is	1
absolutely	1
true.	1
	1
"In	1
short,	1
hoping	1
to	1
settle	1
matters	1
by	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
warlike	1
attitude,	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
landed	1
ourselves	1
in	1
war,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
in	1
war	1
on	1
our	1
own	1
frontiers,	1
with	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia.	1
We	1
have	1
everything	1
in	1
perfect	1
order,	1
only	1
one	1
little	1
thing	1
is	1
lacking,	1
namely,	1
a	1
commander	1
in	1
chief.	1
As	1
it	1
was	1
considered	1
that	1
the	1
Austerlitz	1
success	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
decisive	1
had	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
young,	1
all	1
our	1
octogenarians	1
were	1
reviewed,	1
and	1
of	1
Prozorovski	1
and	1
Kamenski	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
preferred.	1
The	1
general	1
comes	1
to	1
us,	1
Suvorov-	1
like,	1
in	1
a	1
kibitka,	1
and	1
is	1
received	1
with	1
acclamations	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
triumph.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
4th,	1
the	1
first	1
courier	1
arrives	1
from	1
Petersburg.	1
The	1
mails	1
are	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
room,	1
for	1
he	1
likes	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
himself.	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
to	1
help	1
sort	1
the	1
letters	1
and	1
take	1
those	1
meant	1
for	1
us.	1
The	1
field	1
marshal	1
looks	1
on	1
and	1
waits	1
for	1
letters	1
addressed	1
to	1
him.	1
We	1
search,	1
but	1
none	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
The	1
field	1
marshal	1
grows	1
impatient	1
and	1
sets	1
to	1
work	1
himself	1
and	1
finds	1
letters	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
Count	1
T.,	1
Prince	1
V.,	1
and	1
others.	1
Then	1
he	1
bursts	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
wild	1
furies	1
and	1
rages	1
at	1
everyone	1
and	1
everything,	1
seizes	1
the	1
letters,	1
opens	1
them,	1
and	1
reads	1
those	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor	1
addressed	1
to	1
others.	1
'Ah!	1
So	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
treat	1
me!	1
No	1
confidence	1
in	1
me!	1
Ah,	1
ordered	1
to	1
keep	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
me!	1
Very	1
well	1
then!	1
Get	1
along	1
with	1
you!'	1
So	1
he	1
writes	1
the	1
famous	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
to	1
General	1
Bennigsen:	1
	1
'I	1
am	1
wounded	1
and	1
cannot	1
ride	1
and	1
consequently	1
cannot	1
command	1
the	1
army.	1
You	1
have	1
brought	1
your	1
army	1
corps	1
to	1
Pultusk,	1
routed:	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
exposed,	1
and	1
without	1
fuel	1
or	1
forage,	1
so	1
something	1
must	1
be	1
done,	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
yourself	1
reported	1
to	1
Count	1
Buxhowden	1
yesterday,	1
you	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
retreating	1
to	1
our	1
frontier--which	1
do	1
today.'	1
	1
"'From	1
all	1
my	1
riding,'	1
he	1
writes	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
'I	1
have	1
got	1
a	1
saddle	1
sore	1
which,	1
coming	1
after	1
all	1
my	1
previous	1
journeys,	1
quite	1
prevents	1
my	1
riding	1
and	1
commanding	1
so	1
vast	1
an	1
army,	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
passed	1
on	1
the	1
command	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
next	1
in	1
seniority,	1
Count	1
Buxhowden,	1
having	1
sent	1
him	1
my	1
whole	1
staff	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
belongs	1
to	1
it,	1
advising	1
him	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
bread,	1
to	1
move	1
farther	1
into	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
Prussia,	1
for	1
only	1
one	1
day's	1
ration	1
of	1
bread	1
remains,	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
regiments	1
none	1
at	1
all,	1
as	1
reported	1
by	1
the	1
division	1
commanders,	1
Ostermann	1
and	1
Sedmoretzki,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
has	1
been	1
eaten	1
up.	1
I	1
myself	1
will	1
remain	1
in	1
hospital	1
at	1
Ostrolenka	1
till	1
I	1
recover.	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
humbly	1
submit	1
my	1
report,	1
with	1
the	1
information	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
army	1
remains	1
in	1
its	1
present	1
bivouac	1
another	1
fortnight	1
there	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
healthy	1
man	1
left	1
in	1
it	1
by	1
spring.	1
	1
"'Grant	1
leave	1
to	1
retire	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
seat	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
already	1

the	1
great	1

which	1

I	1
shall	1
await	1
your	1
most	1
gracious	1
permission	1
here	1
in	1
hospital,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
secretary	1
rather	1
than	1
commander	1
in	1
the	1
army.	1
My	1
removal	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
does	1
not	1
produce	1
the	1
slightest	1
stir--a	1
blind	1
man	1
has	1
left	1
it.	1
There	1
are	1
thousands	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
in	1
Russia.'	1
	1
"The	1
field	1
marshal	1
is	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
he	1
punishes	1
us	1
all,	1
isn't	1
it	1
logical?	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
act.	1
Those	1
that	1
follow	1
are	1
naturally	1
increasingly	1
interesting	1
and	1
entertaining.	1
After	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
departure	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
must	1
give	1
battle.	1
Buxhowden	1
is	1
commander-in-chief	1
by	1
seniority,	1
but	1
General	1
Bennigsen	1
does	1
not	1
quite	1
see	1
it;	1
more	1
particularly	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
corps	1
who	1
are	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
he	1
wishes	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
battle	1
'on	1
his	1
own	1
hand'	1
as	1
the	1
Germans	1
say.	1
He	1
does	1
so.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Pultusk,	1
which	1
is	1
considered	1
a	1
great	1
victory	1
but	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
was	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
We	1
civilians,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
way	1
of	1
deciding	1
whether	1
a	1
battle	1
was	1
won	1
or	1
lost.	1
Those	1
who	1
retreat	1
after	1
a	1
battle	1
have	1
lost	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
say;	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
who	1
lost	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Pultusk.	1
In	1
short,	1
we	1
retreat	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
but	1
send	1
a	1
courier	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
with	1
news	1
of	1
a	1
victory,	1
and	1
General	1
Bennigsen,	1
hoping	1
to	1
receive	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
as	1
a	1
reward	1
for	1
his	1
victory,	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
General	1
Buxhowden.	1
During	1
this	1
interregnum	1
we	1
begin	1
a	1
very	1
original	1
and	1
interesting	1
series	1
of	1
maneuvers.	1
Our	1
aim	1
is	1
no	1
longer,	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be,	1
to	1
avoid	1
or	1
attack	1
the	1
enemy,	1
but	1
solely	1
to	1
avoid	1
General	1
Buxhowden	1
who	1
by	1
right	1
of	1
seniority	1
should	1
be	1
our	1
chief.	1
So	1
energetically	1
do	1
we	1
pursue	1
this	1
aim	1
that	1
after	1
crossing	1
an	1
unfordable	1
river	1
we	1
burn	1
the	1
bridges	1
to	1
separate	1
ourselves	1
from	1
our	1
enemy,	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
is	1
not	1
Bonaparte	1
but	1
Buxhowden.	1
General	1
Buxhowden	1
was	1
all	1
but	1
attacked	1
and	1
captured	1
by	1
a	1
superior	1
enemy	1
force	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
maneuvers	1
that	1
enabled	1
us	1
to	1
escape	1
him.	1
Buxhowden	1
pursues	1
us--we	1
scuttle.	1
He	1
hardly	1
crosses	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
our	1
side	1
before	1
we	1
recross	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
At	1
last	1
our	1
enemy,	1
Buxhowden,	1
catches	1
us	1
and	1
attacks.	1
Both	1
generals	1
are	1
angry,	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
is	1
a	1
challenge	1
on	1
Buxhowden's	1
part	1
and	1
an	1
epileptic	1
fit	1
on	1
Bennigsen's.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
critical	1
moment	1
the	1
courier	1
who	1
carried	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
our	1
victory	1
at	1
Pultusk	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
returns	1
bringing	1
our	1
appointment	1
as	1
commander-in-chief,	1
and	1
our	1
first	1
foe,	1
Buxhowden,	1
is	1
vanquished;	1
we	1
can	1
now	1
turn	1
our	1
thoughts	1
to	1
the	1
second,	1
Bonaparte.	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
turns	1
out,	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
third	1
enemy	1
rises	1
before	1
us--namely	1
the	1
Orthodox	1
Russian	1
soldiers,	1
loudly	1
demanding	1
bread,	1
meat,	1
biscuits,	1
fodder,	1
and	1
whatnot!	1
The	1
stores	1
are	1
empty,	1
the	1
roads	1
impassable.	1
The	1
Orthodox	1
begin	1
looting,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
which	1
our	1
last	1
campaign	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
idea.	1
Half	1
the	1
regiments	1
form	1
bands	1
and	1
scour	1
the	1
countryside	1
and	1
put	1
everything	1
to	1
fire	1
and	1
sword.	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
are	1
totally	1
ruined,	1
the	1
hospitals	1
overflow	1
with	1
sick,	1
and	1
famine	1
is	1
everywhere.	1
Twice	1
the	1
marauders	1
even	1
attack	1
our	1
headquarters,	1
and	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
has	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
battalion	1
to	1
disperse	1
them.	1
During	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
attacks	1
they	1
carried	1
off	1
my	1
empty	1
portmanteau	1
and	1
my	1
dressing	1
gown.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
proposes	1
to	1
give	1
all	1
commanders	1
of	1
divisions	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
shoot	1
marauders,	1
but	1
I	1
much	1
fear	1
this	1
will	1
oblige	1
one	1
half	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
shoot	1
the	1
other."	1
	1
At	1
first	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
read	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
only,	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
(although	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
was	1
safe	1
to	1
trust	1
Bilibin),	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
began	1
to	1
interest	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
thus	1
far,	1
he	1
crumpled	1
the	1
letter	1
up	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
away.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
that	1
vexed	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
out	1
there	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
no	1
part	1
could	1
perturb	1
him.	1
He	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes,	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
all	1
interest	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
read,	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
nursery.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
strange	1
noise	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
alarm	1
lest	1
something	1
should	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
child	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
the	1
letter.	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
door	1
and	1
opened	1
it.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
nurse	1
was	1
hiding	1
something	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
look	1
and	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
by	1
the	1
cot.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
he	1
heard	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
her	1
despairing	1
whisper	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
As	1
often	1
happens	1
after	1
long	1
sleeplessness	1
and	1
long	1
anxiety,	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
an	1
unreasoning	1
panic--it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
dead.	1
All	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
seemed	1
to	1
confirm	1
this	1
terror.	1
	1
"All	1
is	1
over,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
a	1
cold	1
sweat	1
broke	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
forehead.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
cot	1
in	1
confusion,	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
it	1
empty	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
nurse	1
had	1
been	1
hiding	1
the	1
dead	1
baby.	1
He	1
drew	1
the	1
curtain	1
aside	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
his	1
frightened,	1
restless	1
eyes	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
baby.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
saw	1
him:	1
the	1
rosy	1
boy	1
had	1
tossed	1
about	1
till	1
he	1
lay	1
across	1
the	1
bed	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
pillow,	1
and	1
was	1
smacking	1
his	1
lips	1
in	1
his	1
sleep	1
and	1
breathing	1
evenly.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
as	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
boy	1
like	1
that,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
lost	1
him.	1
He	1
bent	1
over	1
him	1
and,	1
as	1
his	1
sister	1
had	1
taught	1
him,	1
tried	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
whether	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
still	1
feverish.	1
The	1
soft	1
forehead	1
was	1
moist.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
touched	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
hand;	1
even	1
the	1
hair	1
was	1
wet,	1
so	1
profusely	1
had	1
the	1
child	1
perspired.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
evidently	1
the	1
crisis	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
convalescent.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
longed	1
to	1
snatch	1
up,	1
to	1
squeeze,	1
to	1
hold	1
to	1
his	1
heart,	1
this	1
helpless	1
little	1
creature,	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
He	1
stood	1
over	1
him,	1
gazing	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
which	1
showed	1
under	1
the	1
blanket.	1
He	1
heard	1
a	1
rustle	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
shadow	1
appeared	1
under	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
the	1
cot.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round,	1
but	1
still	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
infant's	1
face	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
regular	1
breathing.	1
The	1
dark	1
shadow	1
was	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cot	1
with	1
noiseless	1
steps,	1
lifted	1
the	1
curtain,	1
and	1
dropped	1
it	1
again	1
behind	1
her.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
recognized	1
her	1
without	1
looking	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
pressed	1
it.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
perspired,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
so."	1
	1
The	1
child	1
moved	1
slightly	1
in	1
his	1
sleep,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
against	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
sister.	1
In	1
the	1
dim	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
curtain	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
shone	1
more	1
brightly	1
than	1
usual	1
from	1
the	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
them.	1
She	1
leaned	1
over	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
slightly	1
catching	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
the	1
cot.	1
Each	1
made	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
warning	1
gesture	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
beneath	1
the	1
curtain	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
leave	1
that	1
seclusion	1
where	1
they	1
three	1
were	1
shut	1
off	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
world.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
move	1
away,	1
ruffling	1
his	1
hair	1
against	1
the	1
muslin	1
of	1
the	1
curtain.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
left	1
me	1
now,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
his	1
admission	1
to	1
the	1
masonic	1
Brotherhood,	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Kiev	1
province,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
greatest	1
number	1
of	1
serfs,	1
taking	1
with	1
him	1
full	1
directions	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
down	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
guidance	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
on	1
his	1
estates.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
Kiev	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
stewards	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
office	1
and	1
explained	1
to	1
them	1
his	1
intentions	1
and	1
wishes.	1
He	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
steps	1
would	1
be	1
taken	1
immediately	1
to	1
free	1
his	1
serfs--and	1
that	1
till	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overburdened	1
with	1
labor,	1
women	1
while	1
nursing	1
their	1
babies	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
work,	1
assistance	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
serfs,	1
punishments	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
admonitory	1
and	1
not	1
corporal,	1
and	1
hospitals,	1
asylums,	1
and	1
schools	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
established	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
estates.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
stewards	1
(there	1
were	1
semiliterate	1
foremen	1
among	1
them)	1
listened	1
with	1
alarm,	1
supposing	1
these	1
words	1
to	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
count	1
was	1
displeased	1
with	1
their	1
management	1
and	1
embezzlement	1
of	1
money,	1
some	1
after	1
their	1
first	1
fright	1
were	1
amused	1
by	1
Pierre's	1
lisp	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
words	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
before,	1
others	1
simply	1
enjoyed	1
hearing	1
how	1
the	1
master	1
talked,	1
while	1
the	1
cleverest	1
among	1
them,	1
including	1
the	1
chief	1
steward,	1
understood	1
from	1
this	1
speech	1
how	1
they	1
could	1
best	1
handle	1
the	1
master	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
ends.	1
	1
The	1
chief	1
steward	1
expressed	1
great	1
sympathy	1
with	1
Pierre's	1
intentions,	1
but	1
remarked	1
that	1
besides	1
these	1
changes	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
general	1
state	1
of	1
affairs	1
which	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
satisfactory.	1
	1
Despite	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
enormous	1
wealth,	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
an	1
income	1
which	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
amount	1
to	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
himself	1
far	1
poorer	1
than	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
an	1
allowance	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
rubles.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
dim	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
budget:	1
	1
About	1
80,000	1
went	1
in	1
payments	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
estates	1
to	1
the	1
Land	1
Bank,	1
about	1
30,000	1
went	1
for	1
the	1
upkeep	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
town	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
allowance	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
princesses;	1
about	1
15,000	1
was	1
given	1
in	1
pensions	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
amount	1
for	1
asylums;	1
150,000	1
alimony	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
countess;	1
about	1
70,000	1
went	1
for	1
interest	1
on	1
debts.	1
The	1
building	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
church,	1
previously	1
begun,	1
had	1
cost	1
about	1
10,000	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
years,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
the	1
rest,	1
about	1
100,000	1
rubles,	1
was	1
spent,	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
year	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
borrow.	1
Besides	1
this	1
the	1
chief	1
steward	1
wrote	1
every	1
year	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
fires	1
and	1
bad	1
harvests,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
rebuilding	1
factories	1
and	1
workshops.	1
So	1
the	1
first	1
task	1
Pierre	1
had	1
to	1
face	1
was	1
one	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
aptitude	1
or	1
inclination--practical	1
business.	1
	1
He	1
discussed	1
estate	1
affairs	1
every	1
day	1
with	1
his	1
chief	1
steward.	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
forward	1
matters	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
these	1
consultations	1
were	1
detached	1
from	1
real	1
affairs	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
link	1
up	1
with	1
them	1
or	1
make	1
them	1
move.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
the	1
chief	1
steward	1
put	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
worst	1
light,	1
pointing	1
out	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
paying	1
off	1
the	1
debts	1
and	1
undertaking	1
new	1
activities	1
with	1
serf	1
labor,	1
to	1
which	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
agree.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
Pierre	1
demanded	1
that	1
steps	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
liberate	1
the	1
serfs,	1
which	1
the	1
steward	1
met	1
by	1
showing	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
first	1
paying	1
off	1
the	1
loans	1
from	1
the	1
Land	1
Bank,	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
impossibility	1
of	1
a	1
speedy	1
emancipation.	1
	1
The	1
steward	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
impossible,	1
but	1
suggested	1
selling	1
the	1
forests	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Kostroma,	1
the	1
land	1
lower	1
down	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
Crimean	1
estate,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
possible:	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
operations	1
according	1
to	1
him	1
were	1
connected	1
with	1
such	1
complicated	1
measures--the	1
removal	1
of	1
injunctions,	1
petitions,	1
permits,	1
and	1
so	1
on--	1
that	1
Pierre	1
became	1
quite	1
bewildered	1
and	1
only	1
replied:	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
practical	1
persistence	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
himself	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
disliked	1
it	1
and	1
only	1
tried	1
to	1
pretend	1
to	1
the	1
steward	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
attending	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
steward	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
tried	1
to	1
pretend	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
these	1
consultations	1
very	1
valuable	1
for	1
the	1
proprietor	1
and	1
troublesome	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
In	1
Kiev	1
Pierre	1
found	1
some	1
people	1
he	1
knew,	1
and	1
strangers	1
hastened	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
joyfully	1
welcomed	1
the	1
rich	1
newcomer,	1
the	1
largest	1
landowner	1
of	1
the	1
province.	1
Temptations	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
greatest	1
weakness--	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
confessed	1
when	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
Lodge--were	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
them.	1
Again	1
whole	1
days,	1
weeks,	1
and	1
months	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
passed	1
in	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
rush	1
and	1
were	1
as	1
much	1
occupied	1
with	1
evening	1
parties,	1
dinners,	1
lunches,	1
and	1
balls,	1
giving	1
him	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
reflection,	1
as	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
Instead	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
lead	1
he	1
still	1
lived	1
the	1
old	1
life,	1
only	1
in	1
new	1
surroundings.	1
	1
Of	1
the	1
three	1
precepts	1
of	1
Freemasonry	1
Pierre	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
fulfill	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
enjoined	1
every	1
Mason	1
to	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
moral	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
virtues	1
he	1
lacked	1
two--morality	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
death.	1
He	1
consoled	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
fulfilled	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
precepts--that	1
of	1
reforming	1
the	1
human	1
race--and	1
had	1
other	1
virtues--love	1
of	1
his	1
neighbor,	1
and	1
especially	1
generosity.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
1807	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
visit	1
all	1
his	1
estates	1
and	1
see	1
for	1
himself	1
how	1
far	1
his	1
orders	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
out	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
state	1
were	1
the	1
serfs	1
whom	1
God	1
had	1
entrusted	1
to	1
his	1
care	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
benefit.	1
	1
The	1
chief	1
steward,	1
who	1
considered	1
the	1
young	1
count's	1
attempts	1
almost	1
insane--unprofitable	1
to	1
himself,	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
serfs--made	1
some	1
concessions.	1
Continuing	1
to	1
represent	1
the	1
liberation	1
of	1
the	1
serfs	1
as	1
impracticable,	1
he	1
arranged	1
for	1
the	1
erection	1
of	1
large	1
buildings--schools,	1
hospitals,	1
and	1
asylums--on	1
all	1
the	1
estates	1
before	1
the	1
master	1
arrived.	1
Everywhere	1
preparations	1
were	1
made	1
not	1
for	1
ceremonious	1
welcomes	1
(which	1
he	1
knew	1
Pierre	1
would	1
not	1
like),	1
but	1
for	1
just	1
such	1
gratefully	1
religious	1
ones,	1
with	1
offerings	1
of	1
icons	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
salt	1
of	1
hospitality,	1
as,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
understanding	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
would	1
touch	1
and	1
delude	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
southern	1
spring,	1
the	1
comfortable	1
rapid	1
traveling	1
in	1
a	1
Vienna	1
carriage,	1
and	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
all	1
had	1
a	1
gladdening	1
effect	1
on	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
estates	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
before	1
visited	1
were	1
each	1
more	1
picturesque	1
than	1
the	1
other;	1
the	1
serfs	1
everywhere	1
seemed	1
thriving	1
and	1
touchingly	1
grateful	1
for	1
the	1
benefits	1
conferred	1
on	1
them.	1
Everywhere	1
were	1
receptions,	1
which	1
though	1
they	1
embarrassed	1
Pierre	1
awakened	1
a	1
joyful	1
feeling	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
In	1
one	1
place	1
the	1
peasants	1
presented	1
him	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
salt	1
and	1
an	1
icon	1
of	1
Saint	1
Peter	1
and	1
Saint	1
Paul,	1
asking	1
permission,	1
as	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
their	1
gratitude	1
for	1
the	1
benefits	1
he	1
had	1
conferred	1
on	1
them,	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
new	1
chantry	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
expense	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
Peter	1
and	1
Paul,	1
his	1
patron	1
saints.	1
In	1
another	1
place	1
the	1
women	1
with	1
infants	1
in	1
arms	1
met	1
him	1
to	1
thank	1
him	1
for	1
releasing	1
them	1
from	1
hard	1
work.	1
On	1
a	1
third	1
estate	1
the	1
priest,	1
bearing	1
a	1
cross,	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
surrounded	1
by	1
children	1
whom,	1
by	1
the	1
count's	1
generosity,	1
he	1
was	1
instructing	1
in	1
reading,	1
writing,	1
and	1
religion.	1
On	1
all	1
his	1
estates	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
eyes	1
brick	1
buildings	1
erected	1
or	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
erection,	1
all	1
on	1
one	1
plan,	1
for	1
hospitals,	1
schools,	1
and	1
almshouses,	1
which	1
were	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
opened.	1
Everywhere	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
stewards'	1
accounts,	1
according	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
serfs'	1
manorial	1
labor	1
had	1
been	1
diminished,	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
touching	1
thanks	1
of	1
deputations	1
of	1
serfs	1
in	1
their	1
full-skirted	1
blue	1
coats.	1
	1
What	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
presented	1
him	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
salt	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
chantry	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
Peter	1
and	1
Paul	1
was	1
a	1
market	1
village	1
where	1
a	1
fair	1
was	1
held	1
on	1
St.	1
Peter's	1
day,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
richest	1
peasants	1
(who	1
formed	1
the	1
deputation)	1
had	1
begun	1
the	1
chantry	1
long	1
before,	1
but	1
that	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
in	1
that	1
villages	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
poverty.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
the	1
nursing	1
mothers	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
sent	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
land,	1
they	1
did	1
still	1
harder	1
work	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
land.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
priest	1
who	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
cross	1
oppressed	1
the	1
peasants	1
by	1
his	1
exactions,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
pupils'	1
parents	1
wept	1
at	1
having	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
secured	1
their	1
release	1
by	1
heavy	1
payments.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
brick	1
buildings,	1
built	1
to	1
plan,	1
were	1
being	1
built	1
by	1
serfs	1
whose	1
manorial	1
labor	1
was	1
thus	1
increased,	1
though	1
lessened	1
on	1
paper.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
where	1
the	1
steward	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
accounts	1
that	1
the	1
serfs'	1
payments	1
had	1
been	1
diminished	1
by	1
a	1
third,	1
their	1
obligatory	1
manorial	1
work	1
had	1
been	1
increased	1
by	1
a	1
half.	1
And	1
so	1
Pierre	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
his	1
estates	1
and	1
quite	1
recovered	1
the	1
philanthropic	1
mood	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
wrote	1
enthusiastic	1
letters	1
to	1
his	1
"brother-instructor"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master.	1
	1
"How	1
easy	1
it	1
is,	1
how	1
little	1
effort	1
it	1
needs,	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
good,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"and	1
how	1
little	1
attention	1
we	1
pay	1
to	1
it!"	1
	1
He	1
was	1
pleased	1
at	1
the	1
gratitude	1
he	1
received,	1
but	1
felt	1
abashed	1
at	1
receiving	1
it.	1
This	1
gratitude	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
he	1
might	1
do	1
for	1
these	1
simple,	1
kindly	1
people.	1
	1
The	1
chief	1
steward,	1
a	1
very	1
stupid	1
but	1
cunning	1
man	1
who	1
saw	1
perfectly	1
through	1
the	1
naive	1
and	1
intelligent	1
count	1
and	1
played	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
toy,	1
seeing	1
the	1
effect	1
these	1
prearranged	1
receptions	1
had	1
on	1
Pierre,	1
pressed	1
him	1
still	1
harder	1
with	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
impossibility	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
uselessness	1
of	1
freeing	1
the	1
serfs,	1
who	1
were	1
quite	1
happy	1
as	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
Pierre	1
in	1
his	1
secret	1
soul	1
agreed	1
with	1
the	1
steward	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
imagine	1
happier	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
God	1
only	1
knew	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
free,	1
but	1
he	1
insisted,	1
though	1
reluctantly,	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
right.	1
The	1
steward	1
promised	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
count's	1
wishes,	1
seeing	1
clearly	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
would	1
the	1
count	1
never	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
all	1
measures	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
forests	1
and	1
to	1
release	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
Land	1
Bank,	1
but	1
would	1
probably	1
never	1
even	1
inquire	1
and	1
would	1
never	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
newly	1
erected	1
buildings	1
were	1
standing	1
empty	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
serfs	1
continued	1
to	1
give	1
in	1
money	1
and	1
work	1
all	1
that	1
other	1
people's	1
serfs	1
gave--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
them.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Returning	1
from	1
his	1
journey	1
through	1
South	1
Russia	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
Pierre	1
carried	1
out	1
an	1
intention	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
had	1
of	1
visiting	1
his	1
friend	1
Bolkonski,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
two	1
years.	1
	1
Bogucharovo	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
flat	1
uninteresting	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
among	1
fields	1
and	1
forests	1
of	1
fir	1
and	1
birch,	1
which	1
were	1
partly	1
cut	1
down.	1
The	1
house	1
lay	1
behind	1
a	1
newly	1
dug	1
pond	1
filled	1
with	1
water	1
to	1
the	1
brink	1
and	1
with	1
banks	1
still	1
bare	1
of	1
grass.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
that	1
stretched	1
along	1
the	1
highroad	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
copse	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
a	1
few	1
fir	1
trees.	1
	1
The	1
homestead	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
threshing	1
floor,	1
outhouses,	1
stables,	1
a	1
bathhouse,	1
a	1
lodge,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
brick	1
house	1
with	1
semicircular	1
facade	1
still	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
construction.	1
Round	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
a	1
garden	1
newly	1
laid	1
out.	1
The	1
fences	1
and	1
gates	1
were	1
new	1
and	1
solid;	1
two	1
fire	1
pumps	1
and	1
a	1
water	1
cart,	1
painted	1
green,	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
shed;	1
the	1
paths	1
were	1
straight,	1
the	1
bridges	1
were	1
strong	1
and	1
had	1
handrails.	1
Everything	1
bore	1
an	1
impress	1
of	1
tidiness	1
and	1
good	1
management.	1
Some	1
domestic	1
serfs	1
Pierre	1
met,	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
prince	1
lived,	1
pointed	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
newly	1
built	1
lodge	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
pond.	1
Anton,	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
looked	1
after	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
his	1
boyhood,	1
helped	1
Pierre	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
carriage,	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
clean	1
little	1
anteroom.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
modesty	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
though	1
clean	1
house	1
after	1
the	1
brilliant	1
surroundings	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
last	1
met	1
his	1
friend	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
He	1
quickly	1
entered	1
the	1
small	1
reception	1
room	1
with	1
its	1
still-unplastered	1
wooden	1
walls	1
redolent	1
of	1
pine,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
farther,	1
but	1
Anton	1
ran	1
ahead	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
knocked	1
at	1
a	1
door.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
is	1
it?"	1
came	1
a	1
sharp,	1
unpleasant	1
voice.	1
	1
"A	1
visitor,"	1
answered	1
Anton.	1
	1
"Ask	1
him	1
to	1
wait,"	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
was	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
being	1
pushed	1
back.	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
suddenly	1
came	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
frowning	1
and	1
looking	1
old.	1
Pierre	1
embraced	1
him	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
spectacles	1
kissed	1
his	1
friend	1
on	1
the	1
cheek	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
closely.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Pierre	1
said	1
nothing;	1
he	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
with	1
surprise.	1
He	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
him.	1
His	1
words	1
were	1
kindly	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
face,	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
dull	1
and	1
lifeless	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
evident	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
joyous	1
and	1
glad	1
sparkle.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
grown	1
thinner,	1
paler,	1
and	1
more	1
manly-	1
looking,	1
but	1
what	1
amazed	1
and	1
estranged	1
Pierre	1
till	1
he	1
got	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
were	1
his	1
inertia	1
and	1
a	1
wrinkle	1
on	1
his	1
brow	1
indicating	1
prolonged	1
concentration	1
on	1
some	1
one	1
thought.	1
	1
As	1
is	1
usually	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
people	1
meeting	1
after	1
a	1
prolonged	1
separation,	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
before	1
their	1
conversation	1
could	1
settle	1
on	1
anything.	1
They	1
put	1
questions	1
and	1
gave	1
brief	1
replies	1
about	1
things	1
they	1
knew	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
talked	1
over	1
at	1
length.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
conversation	1
gradually	1
settled	1
on	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
topics	1
at	1
first	1
lightly	1
touched	1
on:	1
their	1
past	1
life,	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
Pierre's	1
journeys	1
and	1
occupations,	1
the	1
war,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
The	1
preoccupation	1
and	1
despondency	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
noticed	1
in	1
his	1
friend's	1
look	1
was	1
now	1
still	1
more	1
clearly	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
joyful	1
animation	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
or	1
the	1
future.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
sympathize	1
with	1
what	1
Pierre	1
was	1
saying,	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
The	1
latter	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
bad	1
taste	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
enthusiasms,	1
dreams,	1
and	1
hopes	1
of	1
happiness	1
or	1
goodness,	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
presence.	1
He	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
new	1
masonic	1
views,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
particularly	1
revived	1
and	1
strengthened	1
by	1
his	1
late	1
tour.	1
He	1
checked	1
himself,	1
fearing	1
to	1
seem	1
naive,	1
yet	1
he	1
felt	1
an	1
irresistible	1
desire	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
friend	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
quite	1
different,	1
and	1
better,	1
Pierre	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
through	1
since	1
then.	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
myself	1
again."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
have	1
altered	1
much,	1
very	1
much,	1
since	1
then,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
you?	1
What	1
are	1
your	1
plans?"	1
	1
"Plans!"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
ironically.	1
"My	1
plans?"	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
word.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
I'm	1
building.	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
settle	1
here	1
altogether	1
next	1
year...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
silently	1
and	1
searchingly	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face,	1
which	1
had	1
grown	1
much	1
older.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
ask..."	1
Pierre	1
began,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
talk	1
of	1
me?...	1
Talk	1
to	1
me,	1
yes,	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
your	1
travels	1
and	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
doing	1
on	1
your	1
estates."	1
	1
Pierre	1
began	1
describing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
on	1
his	1
estates,	1
trying	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
own	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
improvements	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
made.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
several	1
times	1
prompted	1
Pierre's	1
story	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
doing,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
an	1
old-time	1
story,	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
not	1
only	1
without	1
interest	1
but	1
even	1
as	1
if	1
ashamed	1
of	1
what	1
Pierre	1
was	1
telling	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
even	1
depressed	1
in	1
his	1
friend's	1
company	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
became	1
silent.	1
	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
evidently	1
also	1
felt	1
depressed	1
and	1
constrained	1
with	1
his	1
visitor,	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
bivouacking	1
here	1
and	1
have	1
just	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
round.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
sister	1
today.	1
I	1
will	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
her.	1
But	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
know	1
her	1
already,"	1
he	1
said,	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
entertain	1
a	1
visitor	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
found	1
nothing	1
in	1
common.	1
"We	1
will	1
go	1
after	1
dinner.	1
And	1
would	1
you	1
now	1
like	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
my	1
place?"	1
	1
They	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
till	1
dinnertime,	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
political	1
news	1
and	1
common	1
acquaintances	1
like	1
people	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
each	1
other	1
intimately.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
spoke	1
with	1
some	1
animation	1
and	1
interest	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
homestead	1
he	1
was	1
constructing	1
and	1
its	1
buildings,	1
but	1
even	1
here,	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
scaffolding,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
talk	1
explaining	1
the	1
future	1
arrangements	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
interrupted	1
himself:	1
	1
"However,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
interesting.	1
Let	1
us	1
have	1
dinner,	1
and	1
then	1
we'll	1
set	1
off."	1
	1
At	1
dinner,	1
conversation	1
turned	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
marriage.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Pierre	1
blushed,	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
said	1
hurriedly:	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
some	1
time	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
happened.	1
But	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over,	1
and	1
forever."	1
	1
"Forever?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Nothing's	1
forever."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
ended,	1
don't	1
you?	1
You	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
duel?"	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
you	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
that	1
too!"	1
	1
"One	1
thing	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
for	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
kill	1
that	1
man,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Why	1
so?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"To	1
kill	1
a	1
vicious	1
dog	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing	1
really."	1
	1
"No,	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
bad--wrong."	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
wrong?"	1
urged	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
man	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
wrong.	1
Men	1
always	1
did	1
and	1
always	1
will	1
err,	1
and	1
in	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
consider	1
right	1
and	1
wrong."	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
harm	1
to	1
another	1
is	1
wrong,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
feeling	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
his	1
arrival	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
roused,	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
talk,	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
express	1
what	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
present	1
state.	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
has	1
told	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
bad	1
for	1
another	1
man?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Bad!	1
Bad!"	1
exclaimed	1
Pierre.	1
"We	1
all	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
bad	1
for	1
ourselves."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
know	1
that,	1
but	1
the	1
harm	1
I	1
am	1
conscious	1
of	1
in	1
myself	1
is	1
something	1
I	1
cannot	1
inflict	1
on	1
others,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
new	1
outlook	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
French.	1
"I	1
only	1
know	1
two	1
very	1
real	1
evils	1
in	1
life:	1
remorse	1
and	1
illness.	1
The	1
only	1
good	1
is	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
those	1
evils.	1
To	1
live	1
for	1
myself	1
avoiding	1
those	1
two	1
evils	1
is	1
my	1
whole	1
philosophy	1
now."	1
	1
"And	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
neighbor,	1
and	1
self-sacrifice?"	1
began	1
Pierre.	1
"No,	1
I	1
can't	1
agree	1
with	1
you!	1
To	1
live	1
only	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
repent	1
is	1
not	1
enough.	1
I	1
lived	1
like	1
that,	1
I	1
lived	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
ruined	1
my	1
life.	1
And	1
only	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
living,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
trying"	1
(Pierre's	1
modesty	1
made	1
him	1
correct	1
himself)	1
"to	1
live	1
for	1
others,	1
only	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
life.	1
No,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
really	1
believe	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying."	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
silently	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
an	1
ironic	1
smile.	1
	1
"When	1
you	1
see	1
my	1
sister,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
you'll	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
her,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Perhaps	1
you	1
are	1
right	1
for	1
yourself,"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
"but	1
everyone	1
lives	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
You	1
lived	1
for	1
yourself	1
and	1
say	1
you	1
nearly	1
ruined	1
your	1
life	1
and	1
only	1
found	1
happiness	1
when	1
you	1
began	1
living	1
for	1
others.	1
I	1
experienced	1
just	1
the	1
reverse.	1
I	1
lived	1
for	1
glory.--	1
And	1
after	1
all	1
what	1
is	1
glory?	1
The	1
same	1
love	1
of	1
others,	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
them,	1
a	1
desire	1
for	1
their	1
approval.--So	1
I	1
lived	1
for	1
others,	1
and	1
not	1
almost,	1
but	1
quite,	1
ruined	1
my	1
life.	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
become	1
calmer	1
since	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
live	1
only	1
for	1
myself."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
living	1
only	1
for	1
yourself?"	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
growing	1
excited.	1
"What	1
about	1
your	1
son,	1
your	1
sister,	1
and	1
your	1
father?"	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
myself--they	1
are	1
not	1
others,"	1
explained	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"The	1
others,	1
one's	1
neighbors,	1
le	1
prochain,	1
as	1
you	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
call	1
it,	1
are	1
the	1
chief	1
source	1
of	1
all	1
error	1
and	1
evil.	1
Le	1
prochain--your	1
Kiev	1
peasants	1
to	1
whom	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
good."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
mocking,	1
challenging	1
expression.	1
He	1
evidently	1
wished	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
on.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
joking,"	1
replied	1
Pierre,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
excited.	1
"What	1
error	1
or	1
evil	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
wishing	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
and	1
even	1
doing	1
a	1
little--though	1
I	1
did	1
very	1
little	1
and	1
did	1
it	1
very	1
badly?	1
What	1
evil	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
it	1
if	1
unfortunate	1
people,	1
our	1
serfs,	1
people	1
like	1
ourselves,	1
were	1
growing	1
up	1
and	1
dying	1
with	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
truth	1
beyond	1
ceremonies	1
and	1
meaningless	1
prayers	1
and	1
are	1
now	1
instructed	1
in	1
a	1
comforting	1
belief	1
in	1
future	1
life,	1
retribution,	1
recompense,	1
and	1
consolation?	1
What	1
evil	1
and	1
error	1
are	1
there	1
in	1
it,	1
if	1
people	1
were	1
dying	1
of	1
disease	1
without	1
help	1
while	1
material	1
assistance	1
could	1
so	1
easily	1
be	1
rendered,	1
and	1
I	1
supplied	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
doctor,	1
a	1
hospital,	1
and	1
an	1
asylum	1
for	1
the	1
aged?	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
palpable,	1
unquestionable	1
good	1
if	1
a	1
peasant,	1
or	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
baby,	1
has	1
no	1
rest	1
day	1
or	1
night	1
and	1
I	1
give	1
them	1
rest	1
and	1
leisure?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
hurrying	1
and	1
lisping.	1
"And	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
though	1
badly	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
extent;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
something	1
toward	1
it	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
persuade	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
action,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
that,	1
you	1
can't	1
make	1
me	1
believe	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
so	1
yourself.	1
And	1
the	1
main	1
thing	1
is,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"that	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
know	1
for	1
certain,	1
that	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
doing	1
this	1
good	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
sure	1
happiness	1
in	1
life."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
if	1
you	1
put	1
it	1
like	1
that	1
it's	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
matter,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"I	1
build	1
a	1
house	1
and	1
lay	1
out	1
a	1
garden,	1
and	1
you	1
build	1
hospitals.	1
The	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
pastime.	1
But	1
what's	1
right	1
and	1
what's	1
good	1
must	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
one	1
who	1
knows	1
all,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
us.	1
Well,	1
you	1
want	1
an	1
argument,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"come	1
on	1
then."	1
	1
They	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
entrance	1
porch	1
which	1
served	1
as	1
a	1
veranda.	1
	1
"Come,	1
let's	1
argue	1
then,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"You	1
talk	1
of	1
schools,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
crooking	1
a	1
finger,	1
"education	1
and	1
so	1
forth;	1
that	1
is,	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
raise	1
him"	1
(pointing	1
to	1
a	1
peasant	1
who	1
passed	1
by	1
them	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cap)	1
"from	1
his	1
animal	1
condition	1
and	1
awaken	1
in	1
him	1
spiritual	1
needs,	1
while	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
animal	1
happiness	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
happiness	1
possible,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
deprive	1
him	1
of.	1
I	1
envy	1
him,	1
but	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
what	1
I	1
am,	1
without	1
giving	1
him	1
my	1
means.	1
Then	1
you	1
say,	1
'lighten	1
his	1
toil.'	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
it,	1
physical	1
labor	1
is	1
as	1
essential	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
condition	1
of	1
his	1
existence,	1
as	1
mental	1
activity	1
is	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
me.	1
You	1
can't	1
help	1
thinking.	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
after	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
thoughts	1
come	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
sleep	1
but	1
toss	1
about	1
till	1
dawn,	1
because	1
I	1
think	1
and	1
can't	1
help	1
thinking,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
can't	1
help	1
plowing	1
and	1
mowing;	1
if	1
he	1
didn't,	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
drink	1
shop	1
or	1
fall	1
ill.	1
Just	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
his	1
terrible	1
physical	1
labor	1
but	1
should	1
die	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
week,	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
my	1
physical	1
idleness,	1
but	1
would	1
grow	1
fat	1
and	1
die.	1
The	1
third	1
thing--what	1
else	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
talked	1
about?"	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
crooked	1
a	1
third	1
finger.	1
"Ah,	1
yes,	1
hospitals,	1
medicine.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
fit,	1
he	1
is	1
dying,	1
and	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
bleed	1
him	1
and	1
patch	1
him	1
up.	1
He	1
will	1
drag	1
about	1
as	1
a	1
cripple,	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
everybody,	1
for	1
another	1
ten	1
years.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
far	1
easier	1
and	1
simpler	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
die.	1
Others	1
are	1
being	1
born	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
plenty	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
it	1
is.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
different	1
if	1
you	1
grudged	1
losing	1
a	1
laborer--that's	1
how	1
I	1
regard	1
him--but	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
cure	1
him	1
from	1
love	1
of	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
that.	1
And	1
besides,	1
what	1
a	1
notion	1
that	1
medicine	1
ever	1
cured	1
anyone!	1
Killed	1
them,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
he,	1
frowning	1
angrily	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
expressed	1
his	1
ideas	1
so	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
he	1
had	1
reflected	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
readily	1
and	1
rapidly	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
talked	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
His	1
glance	1
became	1
more	1
animated	1
as	1
his	1
conclusions	1
became	1
more	1
hopeless.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
is	1
dreadful,	1
dreadful!"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
how	1
one	1
can	1
live	1
with	1
such	1
ideas.	1
I	1
had	1
such	1
moments	1
myself	1
not	1
long	1
ago,	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
when	1
traveling,	1
but	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
I	1
collapsed	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
live	1
at	1
all--everything	1
seems	1
hateful	1
to	1
me...	1
myself	1
most	1
of	1
all.	1
Then	1
I	1
don't	1
eat,	1
don't	1
wash...	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
with	1
you?..."	1
	1
"Why	1
not	1
wash?	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
cleanly,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew;	1
"on	1
the	1
contrary	1
one	1
must	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
one's	1
life	1
as	1
pleasant	1
as	1
possible.	1
I'm	1
alive,	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
fault,	1
so	1
I	1
must	1
live	1
out	1
my	1
life	1
as	1
best	1
I	1
can	1
without	1
hurting	1
others."	1
	1
"But	1
with	1
such	1
ideas	1
what	1
motive	1
have	1
you	1
for	1
living?	1
One	1
would	1
sit	1
without	1
moving,	1
undertaking	1
nothing...."	1
	1
"Life	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
leaves	1
one	1
no	1
peace.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
thankful	1
to	1
do	1
nothing,	1
but	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
local	1
nobility	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
choose	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
marshal;	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
necessary	1
qualifications	1
for	1
it--the	1
kind	1
of	1
good-natured,	1
fussy	1
shallowness	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
position.	1
Then	1
there's	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
built	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
nook	1
of	1
one's	1
own	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
be	1
quiet.	1
And	1
now	1
there's	1
this	1
recruiting."	1
	1
"Why	1
aren't	1
you	1
serving	1
in	1
the	1
army?"	1
	1
"After	1
Austerlitz!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gloomily.	1
"No,	1
thank	1
you	1
very	1
much!	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
myself	1
not	1
to	1
serve	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
active	1
Russian	1
army.	1
And	1
I	1
won't--not	1
even	1
if	1
Bonaparte	1
were	1
here	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
threatening	1
Bald	1
Hills--even	1
then	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
serve	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
army!	1
Well,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
saying,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
recovering	1
his	1
composure,	1
"now	1
there's	1
this	1
recruiting.	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
chief	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
Third	1
District,	1
and	1
my	1
only	1
way	1
of	1
avoiding	1
active	1
service	1
is	1
to	1
serve	1
under	1
him."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
are	1
serving?"	1
	1
"I	1
am."	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
a	1
little	1
while.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
serve?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
for	1
this	1
reason!	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
time.	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
growing	1
old,	1
and	1
though	1
not	1
exactly	1
cruel	1
he	1
has	1
too	1
energetic	1
a	1
character.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
accustomed	1
to	1
unlimited	1
power	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
terrible,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
has	1
this	1
authority	1
of	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
of	1
the	1
recruiting,	1
granted	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
two	1
hours	1
late	1
a	1
fortnight	1
ago	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
paymaster's	1
clerk	1
at	1
Yukhnovna	1
hanged,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"So	1
I	1
am	1
serving	1
because	1
I	1
alone	1
have	1
any	1
influence	1
with	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
can	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
actions	1
which	1
would	1
torment	1
him	1
afterwards."	1
	1
"Well,	1
there	1
you	1
see!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
imagine,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
continued.	1
"I	1
did	1
not,	1
and	1
do	1
not,	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
care	1
about	1
that	1
scoundrel	1
of	1
a	1
clerk	1
who	1
had	1
stolen	1
some	1
boots	1
from	1
the	1
recruits;	1
I	1
should	1
even	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
hanged,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
my	1
father--that	1
again	1
is	1
for	1
myself."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated.	1
His	1
eyes	1
glittered	1
feverishly	1
while	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
actions	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
his	1
neighbor.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
liberate	1
your	1
serfs,"	1
he	1
continued;	1
"that	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
you--I	1
don't	1
suppose	1
you	1
ever	1
had	1
anyone	1
flogged	1
or	1
sent	1
to	1
Siberia--and	1
still	1
less	1
for	1
your	1
serfs.	1
If	1
they	1
are	1
beaten,	1
flogged,	1
or	1
sent	1
to	1
Siberia,	1
I	1
don't	1
suppose	1
they	1
are	1
any	1
the	1
worse	1
off.	1
In	1
Siberia	1
they	1
lead	1
the	1
same	1
animal	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
stripes	1
on	1
their	1
bodies	1
heal,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
happy	1
as	1
before.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
proprietors	1
who	1
perish	1
morally,	1
bring	1
remorse	1
upon	1
themselves,	1
stifle	1
this	1
remorse	1
and	1
grow	1
callous,	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
inflict	1
punishments	1
justly	1
and	1
unjustly.	1
It	1
is	1
those	1
people	1
I	1
pity,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
sake	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
liberate	1
the	1
serfs.	1
You	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
seen,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
how	1
good	1
men	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
those	1
traditions	1
of	1
unlimited	1
power,	1
in	1
time	1
when	1
they	1
grow	1
more	1
irritable,	1
become	1
cruel	1
and	1
harsh,	1
are	1
conscious	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
cannot	1
restrain	1
themselves	1
and	1
grow	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
miserable."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
spoke	1
so	1
earnestly	1
that	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
thinking	1
that	1
these	1
thoughts	1
had	1
been	1
suggested	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
by	1
his	1
father's	1
case.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"So	1
that's	1
what	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
for--human	1
dignity,	1
peace	1
of	1
mind,	1
purity,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
serfs'	1
backs	1
and	1
foreheads,	1
which,	1
beat	1
and	1
shave	1
as	1
you	1
may,	1
always	1
remain	1
the	1
same	1
backs	1
and	1
foreheads."	1
	1
"No,	1
no!	1
A	1
thousand	1
times	1
no!	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
agree	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Pierre	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
carriage	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
broke	1
the	1
silence	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
remarks	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper.	1
	1
Pointing	1
to	1
the	1
fields,	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
improvements	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
in	1
his	1
husbandry.	1
	1
Pierre	1
remained	1
gloomily	1
silent,	1
answering	1
in	1
monosyllables	1
and	1
apparently	1
immersed	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
thinking	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
unhappy,	1
had	1
gone	1
astray,	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
true	1
light,	1
and	1
that	1
he,	1
Pierre,	1
ought	1
to	1
aid,	1
enlighten,	1
and	1
raise	1
him.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
say,	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
one	1
word,	1
one	1
argument,	1
would	1
upset	1
all	1
his	1
teaching,	1
and	1
he	1
shrank	1
from	1
beginning,	1
afraid	1
of	1
exposing	1
to	1
possible	1
ridicule	1
what	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
precious	1
and	1
sacred.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so?"	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
began,	1
lowering	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
looking	1
like	1
a	1
bull	1
about	1
to	1
charge,	1
"why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so?	1
You	1
should	1
not	1
think	1
so."	1
	1
"Think?	1
What	1
about?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
surprise.	1
	1
"About	1
life,	1
about	1
man's	1
destiny.	1
It	1
can't	1
be	1
so.	1
I	1
myself	1
thought	1
like	1
that,	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
saved	1
me?	1
Freemasonry!	1
No,	1
don't	1
smile.	1
Freemasonry	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
religious	1
ceremonial	1
sect,	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was:	1
Freemasonry	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
best,	1
the	1
eternal,	1
aspects	1
of	1
humanity."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
Freemasonry	1
as	1
he	1
understood	1
it	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
Freemasonry	1
is	1
the	1
teaching	1
of	1
Christianity	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
State	1
and	1
Church,	1
a	1
teaching	1
of	1
equality,	1
brotherhood,	1
and	1
love.	1
	1
"Only	1
our	1
holy	1
brotherhood	1
has	1
the	1
real	1
meaning	1
of	1
life,	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
is	1
a	1
dream,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Understand,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
that	1
outside	1
this	1
union	1
all	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
deceit	1
and	1
falsehood	1
and	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
nothing	1
is	1
left	1
for	1
an	1
intelligent	1
and	1
good	1
man	1
but	1
to	1
live	1
out	1
his	1
life,	1
like	1
you,	1
merely	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
harm	1
others.	1
But	1
make	1
our	1
fundamental	1
convictions	1
your	1
own,	1
join	1
our	1
brotherhood,	1
give	1
yourself	1
up	1
to	1
us,	1
let	1
yourself	1
be	1
guided,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
feel	1
yourself,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
myself,	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
vast	1
invisible	1
chain	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
hidden	1
in	1
heaven,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
looking	1
straight	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
words.	1
More	1
than	1
once,	1
when	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
prevented	1
his	1
catching	1
what	1
Pierre	1
said,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
repeat	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
peculiar	1
glow	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
eyes	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
silence,	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
vain	1
and	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
would	1
not	1
interrupt	1
him	1
or	1
laugh	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
They	1
reached	1
a	1
river	1
that	1
had	1
overflowed	1
its	1
banks	1
and	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
cross	1
by	1
ferry.	1
While	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
horses	1
were	1
being	1
placed	1
on	1
it,	1
they	1
also	1
stepped	1
on	1
the	1
raft.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
leaning	1
his	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
raft	1
railing,	1
gazed	1
silently	1
at	1
the	1
flooding	1
waters	1
glittering	1
in	1
the	1
setting	1
sun.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it?"	1
Pierre	1
asked.	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
silent?"	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
I	1
think	1
about	1
it?	1
I	1
am	1
listening	1
to	1
you.	1
It's	1
all	1
very	1
well....	1
You	1
say:	1
join	1
our	1
brotherhood	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
life,	1
the	1
destiny	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
laws	1
which	1
govern	1
the	1
world.	1
But	1
who	1
are	1
we?	1
Men.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
everything?	1
Why	1
do	1
I	1
alone	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
you	1
see?	1
You	1
see	1
a	1
reign	1
of	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth	1
on	1
earth,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
it."	1
	1
Pierre	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
a	1
future	1
life?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"A	1
future	1
life?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
repeated,	1
but	1
Pierre,	1
giving	1
him	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
reply,	1
took	1
the	1
repetition	1
for	1
a	1
denial,	1
the	1
more	1
readily	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
former	1
atheistic	1
convictions.	1
	1
"You	1
say	1
you	1
can't	1
see	1
a	1
reign	1
of	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth	1
on	1
earth.	1
Nor	1
could	1
I,	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
seen	1
if	1
one	1
looks	1
on	1
our	1
life	1
here	1
as	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
everything.	1
On	1
earth,	1
here	1
on	1
this	1
earth"	1
(Pierre	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
fields),	1
"there	1
is	1
no	1
truth,	1
all	1
is	1
false	1
and	1
evil;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
universe,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
kingdom	1
of	1
truth,	1
and	1
we	1
who	1
are	1
now	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
earth	1
are--eternally--children	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
universe.	1
Don't	1
I	1
feel	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
vast	1
harmonious	1
whole?	1
Don't	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
form	1
one	1
link,	1
one	1
step,	1
between	1
the	1
lower	1
and	1
higher	1
beings,	1
in	1
this	1
vast	1
harmonious	1
multitude	1
of	1
beings	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
Deity--the	1
Supreme	1
Power	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
the	1
term--is	1
manifest?	1
If	1
I	1
see,	1
clearly	1
see,	1
that	1
ladder	1
leading	1
from	1
plant	1
to	1
man,	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
breaks	1
off	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
go	1
farther	1
and	1
farther?	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
vanish,	1
since	1
nothing	1
vanishes	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
exist	1
and	1
always	1
have	1
existed.	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
beyond	1
me	1
and	1
above	1
me	1
there	1
are	1
spirits,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
there	1
is	1
truth."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
Herder's	1
theory,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
can	1
convince	1
me,	1
dear	1
friend--life	1
and	1
death	1
are	1
what	1
convince.	1
What	1
convinces	1
is	1
when	1
one	1
sees	1
a	1
being	1
dear	1
to	1
one,	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
one's	1
own	1
life,	1
before	1
whom	1
one	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
right"	1
(Prince	1
Andrew's	1
voice	1
trembled	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
away),	1
"and	1
suddenly	1
that	1
being	1
is	1
seized	1
with	1
pain,	1
suffers,	1
and	1
ceases	1
to	1
exist....	1
Why?	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
answer.	1
And	1
I	1
believe	1
there	1
is....	1
That's	1
what	1
convinces,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
has	1
convinced	1
me,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
"isn't	1
that	1
what	1
I'm	1
saying?"	1
	1
"No.	1
All	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
argument	1
that	1
convinces	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
future	1
life,	1
but	1
this:	1
when	1
you	1
go	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
with	1
someone	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
person	1
vanishes	1
there,	1
into	1
nowhere,	1
and	1
you	1
yourself	1
are	1
left	1
facing	1
that	1
abyss,	1
and	1
look	1
in.	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
looked	1
in...."	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
it	1
then!	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
there	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Someone?	1
There	1
is	1
the	1
future	1
life.	1
The	1
Someone	1
is--God."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
The	1
carriage	1
and	1
horses	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
been	1
taken	1
off,	1
onto	1
the	1
farther	1
bank,	1
and	1
reharnessed.	1
The	1
sun	1
had	1
sunk	1
half	1
below	1
the	1
horizon	1
and	1
an	1
evening	1
frost	1
was	1
starring	1
the	1
puddles	1
near	1
the	1
ferry,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Andrew,	1
to	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
footmen,	1
coachmen,	1
and	1
ferrymen,	1
still	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
raft	1
and	1
talked.	1
	1
"If	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
and	1
future	1
life,	1
there	1
is	1
truth	1
and	1
good,	1
and	1
man's	1
highest	1
happiness	1
consists	1
in	1
striving	1
to	1
attain	1
them.	1
We	1
must	1
live,	1
we	1
must	1
love,	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
live	1
not	1
only	1
today	1
on	1
this	1
scrap	1
of	1
earth,	1
but	1
have	1
lived	1
and	1
shall	1
live	1
forever,	1
there,	1
in	1
the	1
Whole,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
sky.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stood	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
railing	1
of	1
the	1
raft	1
listening	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
he	1
gazed	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
red	1
reflection	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
gleaming	1
on	1
the	1
blue	1
waters.	1
There	1
was	1
perfect	1
stillness.	1
Pierre	1
became	1
silent.	1
The	1
raft	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
stopped	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
current	1
beat	1
softly	1
against	1
it	1
below.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
refrain	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
words,	1
whispering:	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
true,	1
believe	1
it."	1
	1
He	1
sighed,	1
and	1
glanced	1
with	1
a	1
radiant,	1
childlike,	1
tender	1
look	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
face,	1
flushed	1
and	1
rapturous,	1
but	1
yet	1
shy	1
before	1
his	1
superior	1
friend.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
if	1
it	1
only	1
were	1
so!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"However,	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
on,"	1
he	1
added,	1
and,	1
stepping	1
off	1
the	1
raft,	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
to	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
pointed,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
Austerlitz	1
saw	1
that	1
high,	1
everlasting	1
sky	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
while	1
lying	1
on	1
that	1
battlefield;	1
and	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
slumbering,	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
best	1
within	1
him,	1
suddenly	1
awoke,	1
joyful	1
and	1
youthful,	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
It	1
vanished	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
customary	1
conditions	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
feeling	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
develop	1
existed	1
within	1
him.	1
His	1
meeting	1
with	1
Pierre	1
formed	1
an	1
epoch	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
life.	1
Though	1
outwardly	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
way,	1
inwardly	1
he	1
began	1
a	1
new	1
life.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
It	1
was	1
getting	1
dusk	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Pierre	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
As	1
they	1
approached	1
the	1
house,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
drew	1
Pierre's	1
attention	1
to	1
a	1
commotion	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
porch.	1
A	1
woman,	1
bent	1
with	1
age,	1
with	1
a	1
wallet	1
on	1
her	1
back,	1
and	1
a	1
short,	1
long-haired,	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
garment	1
had	1
rushed	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
carriage	1
driving	1
up.	1
Two	1
women	1
ran	1
out	1
after	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
four,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
carriage,	1
ran	1
in	1
dismay	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
back	1
porch.	1
	1
"Those	1
are	1
Mary's	1
'God's	1
folk,'"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"They	1
have	1
mistaken	1
us	1
for	1
my	1
father.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
matter	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
disobeys	1
him.	1
He	1
orders	1
these	1
pilgrims	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
away,	1
but	1
she	1
receives	1
them."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
are	1
'God's	1
folk'?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
answer.	1
The	1
servants	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
where	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
expected	1
back	1
soon.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
was	1
expected	1
back	1
any	1
minute.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
led	1
Pierre	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
apartments,	1
which	1
were	1
always	1
kept	1
in	1
perfect	1
order	1
and	1
readiness	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
house;	1
he	1
himself	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
sister,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre	1
when	1
he	1
returned.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
her	1
yet,	1
she	1
is	1
hiding	1
now,	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
'God's	1
folk.'	1
It	1
will	1
serve	1
her	1
right,	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
confused,	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
her	1
'God's	1
folk.'	1
It's	1
really	1
very	1
curious."	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
'God's	1
folk'?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Come,	1
and	1
you'll	1
see	1
for	1
yourself."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
really	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
red	1
patches	1
came	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
in.	1
In	1
her	1
snug	1
room,	1
with	1
lamps	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
icon	1
stand,	1
a	1
young	1
lad	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
nose	1
and	1
long	1
hair,	1
wearing	1
a	1
monk's	1
cassock,	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
beside	1
her,	1
behind	1
a	1
samovar.	1
Near	1
them,	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
sat	1
a	1
thin,	1
shriveled,	1
old	1
woman,	1
with	1
a	1
meek	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
childlike	1
face.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
warn	1
me?"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
with	1
mild	1
reproach,	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
before	1
her	1
pilgrims	1
like	1
a	1
hen	1
before	1
her	1
chickens.	1
	1
"Charmee	1
de	1
vous	1
voir.	1
Je	1
suis	1
tres	1
contente	1
de	1
vous	1
voir,"	1
*	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
She	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
now	1
his	1
friendship	1
with	1
Andrew,	1
his	1
misfortune	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
his	1
kindly,	1
simple	1
face	1
disposed	1
her	1
favorably	1
toward	1
him.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"I	1
like	1
you	1
very	1
much,	1
but	1
please	1
don't	1
laugh	1
at	1
my	1
people."	1
After	1
exchanging	1
the	1
first	1
greetings,	1
they	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Delighted	1
to	1
see	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
and	1
Ivanushka	1
is	1
here	1
too!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
glancing	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
pilgrim.	1
	1
"Andrew!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
imploringly.	1
"Il	1
faut	1
que	1
vous	1
sachiez	1
que	1
c'est	1
une	1
femme,"	1
*	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
au	1
nom	1
de	1
Dieu!"	1
*(2)	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
repeated.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
woman."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"For	1
heaven's	1
sake."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
ironical	1
tone	1
toward	1
the	1
pilgrims	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
helpless	1
attempts	1
to	1
protect	1
them	1
were	1
their	1
customary	1
long-established	1
relations	1
on	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
"Mais,	1
ma	1
bonne	1
amie,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"vous	1
devriez	1
au	1
contraire	1
m'être	1
reconnaissante	1
de	1
ce	1
que	1
j'explique	1
a	1
Pierre	1
votre	1
intimité	1
avec	1
ce	1
jeune	1
homme."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
ought	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
be	1
grateful	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
explaining	1
to	1
Pierre	1
your	1
intimacy	1
with	1
this	1
young	1
man."	1
	1
"Really?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
gazing	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
with	1
curiosity	1
and	1
seriousness	1
(for	1
which	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
specially	1
grateful	1
to	1
him)	1
into	1
Ivanushka's	1
face,	1
who,	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
being	1
spoken	1
about,	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
them	1
all	1
with	1
crafty	1
eyes.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
embarrassment	1
on	1
her	1
people's	1
account	1
was	1
quite	1
unnecessary.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
abashed.	1
The	1
old	1
woman,	1
lowering	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
casting	1
side	1
glances	1
at	1
the	1
newcomers,	1
had	1
turned	1
her	1
cup	1
upside	1
down	1
and	1
placed	1
a	1
nibbled	1
bit	1
of	1
sugar	1
beside	1
it,	1
and	1
sat	1
quietly	1
in	1
her	1
armchair,	1
though	1
hoping	1
to	1
be	1
offered	1
another	1
cup	1
of	1
tea.	1
Ivanushka,	1
sipping	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
saucer,	1
looked	1
with	1
sly	1
womanish	1
eyes	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
men.	1
	1
"Where	1
have	1
you	1
been?	1
To	1
Kiev?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
woman.	1
	1
"I	1
have,	1
good	1
sir,"	1
she	1
answered	1
garrulously.	1
"Just	1
at	1
Christmastime	1
I	1
was	1
deemed	1
worthy	1
to	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
and	1
heavenly	1
sacrament	1
at	1
the	1
shrine	1
of	1
the	1
saint.	1
And	1
now	1
I'm	1
from	1
Kolyazin,	1
master,	1
where	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
wonderful	1
blessing	1
has	1
been	1
revealed."	1
	1
"And	1
was	1
Ivanushka	1
with	1
you?"	1
	1
"I	1
go	1
by	1
myself,	1
benefactor,"	1
said	1
Ivanushka,	1
trying	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
a	1
bass	1
voice.	1
"I	1
only	1
came	1
across	1
Pelageya	1
in	1
Yukhnovo..."	1
	1
Pelageya	1
interrupted	1
her	1
companion;	1
she	1
evidently	1
wished	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
"In	1
Kolyazin,	1
master,	1
a	1
wonderful	1
blessing	1
has	1
been	1
revealed."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
Some	1
new	1
relics?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
do	1
leave	1
off,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Don't	1
tell	1
him,	1
Pelageya."	1
	1
"No...	1
why	1
not,	1
my	1
dear,	1
why	1
shouldn't	1
I?	1
I	1
like	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
kind,	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
God's	1
chosen,	1
he's	1
a	1
benefactor,	1
he	1
once	1
gave	1
me	1
ten	1
rubles,	1
I	1
remember.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
Kiev,	1
Crazy	1
Cyril	1
says	1
to	1
me	1
(he's	1
one	1
of	1
God's	1
own	1
and	1
goes	1
barefoot	1
summer	1
and	1
winter),	1
he	1
says,	1
'Why	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
place?	1
Go	1
to	1
Kolyazin	1
where	1
a	1
wonder-working	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Mother	1
of	1
God	1
has	1
been	1
revealed.'	1
On	1
hearing	1
those	1
words	1
I	1
said	1
good-by	1
to	1
the	1
holy	1
folk	1
and	1
went."	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent,	1
only	1
the	1
pilgrim	1
woman	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
measured	1
tones,	1
drawing	1
in	1
her	1
breath.	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
come,	1
master,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
say	1
to	1
me:	1
'A	1
great	1
blessing	1
has	1
been	1
revealed,	1
holy	1
oil	1
trickles	1
from	1
the	1
cheeks	1
of	1
our	1
blessed	1
Mother,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Virgin	1
Mother	1
of	1
God'...."	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,	1
you	1
can	1
tell	1
us	1
afterwards,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
flushing.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
ask	1
her,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
it	1
yourselves?"	1
he	1
inquired.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
master,	1
I	1
was	1
found	1
worthy.	1
Such	1
a	1
brightness	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
like	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
blessed	1
Mother's	1
cheek	1
it	1
drops	1
and	1
drops...."	1
	1
"But,	1
dear	1
me,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
fraud!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
naively,	1
who	1
had	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
the	1
pilgrim.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
master,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
saying?"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
horrified	1
Pelageya,	1
turning	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
for	1
support.	1
	1
"They	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
people,"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
	1
"Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
pilgrim	1
woman,	1
crossing	1
herself.	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
speak	1
so,	1
master!	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
believe,	1
and	1
said,	1
'The	1
monks	1
cheat,'	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he'd	1
said	1
it	1
he	1
went	1
blind.	1
And	1
he	1
dreamed	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Virgin	1
Mother	1
of	1
the	1
Kiev	1
catacombs	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
'Believe	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
whole.'	1
So	1
he	1
begged:	1
'Take	1
me	1
to	1
her,	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
her.'	1
It's	1
the	1
real	1
truth	1
I'm	1
telling	1
you,	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
myself.	1
So	1
he	1
was	1
brought,	1
quite	1
blind,	1
straight	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
goes	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
falls	1
down	1
and	1
says,	1
'Make	1
me	1
whole,'	1
says	1
he,	1
'and	1
I'll	1
give	1
thee	1
what	1
the	1
Tsar	1
bestowed	1
on	1
me.'	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
myself,	1
master,	1
the	1
star	1
is	1
fixed	1
into	1
the	1
icon.	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
He	1
received	1
his	1
sight!	1
It's	1
a	1
sin	1
to	1
speak	1
so.	1
God	1
will	1
punish	1
you,"	1
she	1
said	1
admonishingly,	1
turning	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
the	1
star	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
icon?"	1
Pierre	1
asked.	1
	1
"And	1
was	1
the	1
Holy	1
Mother	1
promoted	1
to	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
general?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Pelageya	1
suddenly	1
grew	1
quite	1
pale	1
and	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
master,	1
master,	1
what	1
a	1
sin!	1
And	1
you	1
who	1
have	1
a	1
son!"	1
she	1
began,	1
her	1
pallor	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
a	1
vivid	1
red.	1
"Master,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
said?	1
God	1
forgive	1
you!"	1
And	1
she	1
crossed	1
herself.	1
"Lord	1
forgive	1
him!	1
My	1
dear,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean?..."	1
she	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and,	1
almost	1
crying,	1
began	1
to	1
arrange	1
her	1
wallet.	1
She	1
evidently	1
felt	1
frightened	1
and	1
ashamed	1
to	1
have	1
accepted	1
charity	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
such	1
things	1
could	1
be	1
said,	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
sorry	1
to	1
have	1
now	1
to	1
forgo	1
the	1
charity	1
of	1
this	1
house.	1
	1
"Now,	1
why	1
need	1
you	1
do	1
it?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
me?..."	1
	1
"Come,	1
Pelageya,	1
I	1
was	1
joking,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Princesse,	1
ma	1
parole,	1
je	1
n'ai	1
pas	1
voulu	1
l'offenser.	1
*	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
anything,	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
joking,"	1
he	1
said,	1
smiling	1
shyly	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
efface	1
his	1
offense.	1
"It	1
was	1
all	1
my	1
fault,	1
and	1
Andrew	1
was	1
only	1
joking."	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Princess,	1
on	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
offend	1
her."	1
	1
Pelageya	1
stopped	1
doubtfully,	1
but	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
sincere	1
penitence,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
glanced	1
so	1
meekly	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
gradually	1
reassured.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
The	1
pilgrim	1
woman	1
was	1
appeased	1
and,	1
being	1
encouraged	1
to	1
talk,	1
gave	1
a	1
long	1
account	1
of	1
Father	1
Amphilochus,	1
who	1
led	1
so	1
holy	1
a	1
life	1
that	1
his	1
hands	1
smelled	1
of	1
incense,	1
and	1
how	1
on	1
her	1
last	1
visit	1
to	1
Kiev	1
some	1
monks	1
she	1
knew	1
let	1
her	1
have	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
catacombs,	1
and	1
how	1
she,	1
taking	1
some	1
dried	1
bread	1
with	1
her,	1
had	1
spent	1
two	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
catacombs	1
with	1
the	1
saints.	1
"I'd	1
pray	1
awhile	1
to	1
one,	1
ponder	1
awhile,	1
then	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
another.	1
I'd	1
sleep	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
go	1
and	1
kiss	1
the	1
relics,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
peace	1
all	1
around,	1
such	1
blessedness,	1
that	1
one	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
out,	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
heaven	1
again."	1
	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
attentively	1
and	1
seriously.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
then,	1
leaving	1
"God's	1
folk"	1
to	1
finish	1
their	1
tea,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
took	1
Pierre	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
kind,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
really	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
hurt	1
her	1
feelings.	1
I	1
understand	1
them	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
greatest	1
respect	1
for	1
them."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
silently	1
and	1
smiled	1
affectionately.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
you	1
see,	1
and	1
am	1
as	1
fond	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
brother,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
find	1
Andrew?"	1
she	1
added	1
hurriedly,	1
not	1
giving	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
her	1
affectionate	1
words.	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
anxious	1
about	1
him.	1
His	1
health	1
was	1
better	1
in	1
the	1
winter,	1
but	1
last	1
spring	1
his	1
wound	1
reopened	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
for	1
a	1
cure.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
very	1
much	1
afraid	1
for	1
him	1
spiritually.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
character	1
like	1
us	1
women	1
who,	1
when	1
we	1
suffer,	1
can	1
weep	1
away	1
our	1
sorrows.	1
He	1
keeps	1
it	1
all	1
within	1
him.	1
Today	1
he	1
is	1
cheerful	1
and	1
in	1
good	1
spirits,	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
your	1
visit--he	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
like	1
that.	1
If	1
you	1
could	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
abroad.	1
He	1
needs	1
activity,	1
and	1
this	1
quiet	1
regular	1
life	1
is	1
very	1
bad	1
for	1
him.	1
Others	1
don't	1
notice	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
it."	1
	1
Toward	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
the	1
men	1
servants	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
door,	1
hearing	1
the	1
bells	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
carriage	1
approaching.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Pierre	1
also	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
"Who's	1
that?"	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
noticing	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
Very	1
glad!	1
Kiss	1
me,"	1
he	1
said,	1
having	1
learned	1
who	1
the	1
young	1
stranger	1
was.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper	1
and	1
very	1
gracious	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Before	1
supper,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
study,	1
found	1
him	1
disputing	1
hotly	1
with	1
his	1
visitor.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
maintaining	1
that	1
a	1
time	1
would	1
come	1
when	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
wars.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
disputed	1
it	1
chaffingly,	1
but	1
without	1
getting	1
angry.	1
	1
"Drain	1
the	1
blood	1
from	1
men's	1
veins	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
water	1
instead,	1
then	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
war!	1
Old	1
women's	1
nonsense--old	1
women's	1
nonsense!"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
patted	1
Pierre	1
affectionately	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
evidently	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
conversation,	1
was	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
papers	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
town.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
business.	1
	1
"The	1
marshal,	1
a	1
Count	1
Rostov,	1
hasn't	1
sent	1
half	1
his	1
contingent.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
town	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
invite	1
me	1
to	1
dinner--I	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
pretty	1
dinner!...	1
And	1
there,	1
look	1
at	1
this....	1
Well,	1
my	1
boy,"	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
went	1
on,	1
addressing	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
patting	1
Pierre	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
"A	1
fine	1
fellow--your	1
friend--I	1
like	1
him!	1
He	1
stirs	1
me	1
up.	1
Another	1
says	1
clever	1
things	1
and	1
one	1
doesn't	1
care	1
to	1
listen,	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
talks	1
rubbish	1
yet	1
stirs	1
an	1
old	1
fellow	1
up.	1
Well,	1
go!	1
Get	1
along!	1
Perhaps	1
I'll	1
come	1
and	1
sit	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
supper.	1
We'll	1
have	1
another	1
dispute.	1
Make	1
friends	1
with	1
my	1
little	1
fool,	1
Princess	1
Mary,"	1
he	1
shouted	1
after	1
Pierre,	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Only	1
now,	1
on	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
did	1
Pierre	1
fully	1
realize	1
the	1
strength	1
and	1
charm	1
of	1
his	1
friendship	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
That	1
charm	1
was	1
not	1
expressed	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
household.	1
With	1
the	1
stern	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
the	1
gentle,	1
timid	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
scarcely	1
known	1
them,	1
Pierre	1
at	1
once	1
felt	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
friend.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
fond	1
of	1
him	1
already.	1
Not	1
only	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
won	1
by	1
his	1
gentleness	1
with	1
the	1
pilgrims,	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
most	1
radiant	1
looks,	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
one-year-old	1
"Prince	1
Nicholas"	1
(as	1
his	1
grandfather	1
called	1
him)	1
smiled	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
pleasant	1
smiles	1
when	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
supper;	1
this	1
was	1
evidently	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
account.	1
And	1
during	1
the	1
two	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
visit	1
he	1
was	1
extremely	1
kind	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
visit	1
them	1
again.	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
met	1
together,	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
opinions	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
people	1
always	1
do	1
after	1
a	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
has	1
left,	1
but	1
as	1
seldom	1
happens,	1
no	1
one	1
said	1
anything	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
When	1
returning	1
from	1
his	1
leave,	1
Rostov	1
felt,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
how	1
close	1
was	1
the	1
bond	1
that	1
united	1
him	1
to	1
Denisov	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment.	1
	1
On	1
approaching	1
it,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
approaching	1
his	1
home	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
first	1
hussar	1
with	1
the	1
unbuttoned	1
uniform	1
of	1
his	1
regiment,	1
when	1
he	1
recognized	1
red-haired	1
Dementyev	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
picket	1
ropes	1
of	1
the	1
roan	1
horses,	1
when	1
Lavrushka	1
gleefully	1
shouted	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
"The	1
count	1
has	1
come!"	1
and	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
asleep	1
on	1
his	1
bed,	1
ran	1
all	1
disheveled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mud	1
hut	1
to	1
embrace	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
collected	1
round	1
to	1
greet	1
the	1
new	1
arrival,	1
Rostov	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
as	1
when	1
his	1
mother,	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
had	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
choked	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak.	1
The	1
regiment	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
home,	1
and	1
as	1
unalterably	1
dear	1
and	1
precious	1
as	1
his	1
parents'	1
house.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
reported	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
reassigned	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
squadron,	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
duty	1
and	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
foraging,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
again	1
entered	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
felt	1
himself	1
deprived	1
of	1
liberty	1
and	1
bound	1
in	1
one	1
narrow,	1
unchanging	1
frame,	1
he	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
sense	1
of	1
peace,	1
of	1
moral	1
support,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
sense	1
of	1
being	1
at	1
home	1
here	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
place,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
under	1
the	1
parental	1
roof.	1
But	1
here	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
turmoil	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
at	1
large,	1
where	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
his	1
right	1
place	1
and	1
took	1
mistaken	1
decisions;	1
here	1
was	1
no	1
Sonya	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
ought,	1
or	1
ought	1
not,	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
explanation;	1
here	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
going	1
there	1
or	1
not	1
going	1
there;	1
here	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
twenty-four	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
ways;	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
innumerable	1
crowd	1
of	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
not	1
one	1
was	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
farther	1
from	1
him	1
than	1
another;	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
uncertain	1
and	1
undefined	1
money	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
recall	1
that	1
terrible	1
loss	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
Here,	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
all	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
simple.	1
The	1
whole	1
world	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
unequal	1
parts:	1
one,	1
our	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment;	1
the	1
other,	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
was	1
no	1
concern	1
of	1
his.	1
In	1
the	1
regiment,	1
everything	1
was	1
definite:	1
who	1
was	1
lieutenant,	1
who	1
captain,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
fellow,	1
who	1
a	1
bad	1
one,	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
comrade.	1
The	1
canteenkeeper	1
gave	1
one	1
credit,	1
one's	1
pay	1
came	1
every	1
four	1
months,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
think	1
out	1
or	1
decide,	1
you	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
that	1
was	1
considered	1
bad	1
in	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment	1
and,	1
when	1
given	1
an	1
order,	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
clearly,	1
distinctly,	1
and	1
definitely	1
ordered--and	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well.	1
	1
Having	1
once	1
more	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
definite	1
conditions	1
of	1
this	1
regimental	1
life,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
the	1
joy	1
and	1
relief	1
a	1
tired	1
man	1
feels	1
on	1
lying	1
down	1
to	1
rest.	1
Life	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
during	1
this	1
campaign,	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
pleasanter	1
for	1
him,	1
because,	1
after	1
his	1
loss	1
to	1
Dolokhov	1
(for	1
which,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
family's	1
efforts	1
to	1
console	1
him,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
forgive	1
himself),	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
his	1
fault	1
by	1
serving,	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
before,	1
but	1
really	1
well,	1
and	1
by	1
being	1
a	1
perfectly	1
first-rate	1
comrade	1
and	1
officer--in	1
a	1
word,	1
a	1
splendid	1
man	1
altogether,	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
seemed	1
so	1
difficult	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
so	1
possible	1
in	1
the	1
regiment.	1
	1
After	1
his	1
losses,	1
he	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
pay	1
back	1
his	1
debt	1
to	1
his	1
parents	1
in	1
five	1
years.	1
He	1
received	1
ten	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year,	1
but	1
now	1
resolved	1
to	1
take	1
only	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
rest	1
to	1
repay	1
the	1
debt	1
to	1
his	1
parents.	1
	1
Our	1
army,	1
after	1
repeated	1
retreats	1
and	1
advances	1
and	1
battles	1
at	1
Pultusk	1
and	1
Preussisch-Eylau,	1
was	1
concentrated	1
near	1
Bartenstein.	1
It	1
was	1
awaiting	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
arrival	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
campaign.	1
	1
The	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment,	1
belonging	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
had	1
served	1
in	1
the	1
1805	1
campaign,	1
had	1
been	1
recruiting	1
up	1
to	1
strength	1
in	1
Russia,	1
and	1
arrived	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
actions	1
of	1
the	1
campaign.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
neither	1
at	1
Pultusk	1
nor	1
at	1
Preussisch-Eylau	1
and,	1
when	1
it	1
joined	1
the	1
army	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
was	1
attached	1
to	1
Platov's	1
division.	1
	1
Platov's	1
division	1
was	1
acting	1
independently	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
army.	1
Several	1
times	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment	1
had	1
exchanged	1
shots	1
with	1
the	1
enemy,	1
had	1
taken	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
once	1
had	1
even	1
captured	1
Marshal	1
Oudinot's	1
carriages.	1
In	1
April	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
were	1
stationed	1
immovably	1
for	1
some	1
weeks	1
near	1
a	1
totally	1
ruined	1
and	1
deserted	1
German	1
village.	1
	1
A	1
thaw	1
had	1
set	1
in,	1
it	1
was	1
muddy	1
and	1
cold,	1
the	1
ice	1
on	1
the	1
river	1
broke,	1
and	1
the	1
roads	1
became	1
impassable.	1
For	1
days	1
neither	1
provisions	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
nor	1
fodder	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
had	1
been	1
issued.	1
As	1
no	1
transports	1
could	1
arrive,	1
the	1
men	1
dispersed	1
about	1
the	1
abandoned	1
and	1
deserted	1
villages,	1
searching	1
for	1
potatoes,	1
but	1
found	1
few	1
even	1
of	1
these.	1
	1
Everything	1
had	1
been	1
eaten	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
had	1
all	1
fled--if	1
any	1
remained,	1
they	1
were	1
worse	1
than	1
beggars	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
could	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
them;	1
even	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
usually	1
pitiless	1
enough,	1
instead	1
of	1
taking	1
anything	1
from	1
them,	1
often	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
their	1
rations.	1
	1
The	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment	1
had	1
had	1
only	1
two	1
men	1
wounded	1
in	1
action,	1
but	1
had	1
lost	1
nearly	1
half	1
its	1
men	1
from	1
hunger	1
and	1
sickness.	1
In	1
the	1
hospitals,	1
death	1
was	1
so	1
certain	1
that	1
soldiers	1
suffering	1
from	1
fever,	1
or	1
the	1
swelling	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
bad	1
food,	1
preferred	1
to	1
remain	1
on	1
duty,	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
drag	1
their	1
legs	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
hospitals.	1
When	1
spring	1
came	1
on,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
found	1
a	1
plant	1
just	1
showing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
asparagus,	1
which,	1
for	1
some	1
reason,	1
they	1
called	1
"Mashka's	1
sweet	1
root."	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
bitter,	1
but	1
they	1
wandered	1
about	1
the	1
fields	1
seeking	1
it	1
and	1
dug	1
it	1
out	1
with	1
their	1
sabers	1
and	1
ate	1
it,	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
ordered	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
noxious	1
plant.	1
That	1
spring	1
a	1
new	1
disease	1
broke	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
a	1
swelling	1
of	1
the	1
arms,	1
legs,	1
and	1
face,	1
which	1
the	1
doctors	1
attributed	1
to	1
eating	1
this	1
root.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
squadron	1
fed	1
chiefly	1
on	1
"Mashka's	1
sweet	1
root,"	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
week	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
biscuits	1
were	1
being	1
doled	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
pound	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
potatoes	1
received	1
had	1
sprouted	1
and	1
frozen.	1
	1
The	1
horses	1
also	1
had	1
been	1
fed	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
on	1
straw	1
from	1
the	1
thatched	1
roofs	1
and	1
had	1
become	1
terribly	1
thin,	1
though	1
still	1
covered	1
with	1
tufts	1
of	1
felty	1
winter	1
hair.	1
	1
Despite	1
this	1
destitution,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
went	1
on	1
living	1
just	1
as	1
usual.	1
Despite	1
their	1
pale	1
swollen	1
faces	1
and	1
tattered	1
uniforms,	1
the	1
hussars	1
formed	1
line	1
for	1
roll	1
call,	1
kept	1
things	1
in	1
order,	1
groomed	1
their	1
horses,	1
polished	1
their	1
arms,	1
brought	1
in	1
straw	1
from	1
the	1
thatched	1
roofs	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
fodder,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
dine	1
round	1
the	1
caldrons	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
hungry,	1
joking	1
about	1
their	1
nasty	1
food	1
and	1
their	1
hunger.	1
As	1
usual,	1
in	1
their	1
spare	1
time,	1
they	1
lit	1
bonfires,	1
steamed	1
themselves	1
before	1
them	1
naked;	1
smoked,	1
picked	1
out	1
and	1
baked	1
sprouting	1
rotten	1
potatoes,	1
told	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
stories	1
of	1
Potemkin's	1
and	1
Suvorov's	1
campaigns,	1
or	1
to	1
legends	1
of	1
Alesha	1
the	1
Sly,	1
or	1
the	1
priest's	1
laborer	1
Mikolka.	1
	1
The	1
officers,	1
as	1
usual,	1
lived	1
in	1
twos	1
and	1
threes	1
in	1
the	1
roofless,	1
half-	1
ruined	1
houses.	1
The	1
seniors	1
tried	1
to	1
collect	1
straw	1
and	1
potatoes	1
and,	1
in	1
general,	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
men.	1
The	1
younger	1
ones	1
occupied	1
themselves	1
as	1
before,	1
some	1
playing	1
cards	1
(there	1
was	1
plenty	1
of	1
money,	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
food),	1
some	1
with	1
more	1
innocent	1
games,	1
such	1
as	1
quoits	1
and	1
skittles.	1
The	1
general	1
trend	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
was	1
rarely	1
spoken	1
of,	1
partly	1
because	1
nothing	1
certain	1
was	1
known	1
about	1
it,	1
partly	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
vague	1
feeling	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
main	1
it	1
was	1
going	1
badly.	1
	1
Rostov	1
lived,	1
as	1
before,	1
with	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
since	1
their	1
furlough	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
more	1
friendly	1
than	1
ever.	1
Denisov	1
never	1
spoke	1
of	1
Rostov's	1
family,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
tender	1
friendship	1
his	1
commander	1
showed	1
him,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
elder	1
hussar's	1
luckless	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha	1
played	1
a	1
part	1
in	1
strengthening	1
their	1
friendship.	1
Denisov	1
evidently	1
tried	1
to	1
expose	1
Rostov	1
to	1
danger	1
as	1
seldom	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
action	1
greeted	1
his	1
safe	1
return	1
with	1
evident	1
joy.	1
On	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
foraging	1
expeditions,	1
in	1
a	1
deserted	1
and	1
ruined	1
village	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
provisions,	1
Rostov	1
found	1
a	1
family	1
consisting	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
Pole	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
with	1
an	1
infant	1
in	1
arms.	1
They	1
were	1
half	1
clad,	1
hungry,	1
too	1
weak	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
obtaining	1
a	1
conveyance.	1
Rostov	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
quarters,	1
placed	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
lodging,	1
and	1
kept	1
them	1
for	1
some	1
weeks	1
while	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
recovering.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
comrades,	1
talking	1
of	1
women,	1
began	1
chaffing	1
Rostov,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
wily	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
thing	1
if	1
he	1
introduced	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
pretty	1
Polish	1
girl	1
he	1
had	1
saved.	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
joke	1
as	1
an	1
insult,	1
flared	1
up,	1
and	1
said	1
such	1
unpleasant	1
things	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
Denisov	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
prevent	1
a	1
duel.	1
When	1
the	1
officer	1
had	1
gone	1
away,	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know	1
what	1
Rostov's	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
Polish	1
girl	1
might	1
be,	1
began	1
to	1
upbraid	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
quickness	1
of	1
temper,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
replied:	1
	1
"Say	1
what	1
you	1
like....	1
She	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
sister	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
it	1
offended	1
me...	1
because...	1
well,	1
for	1
that	1
reason...."	1
	1
Denisov	1
patted	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
began	1
rapidly	1
pacing	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
way	1
at	1
moments	1
of	1
deep	1
feeling.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
what	1
a	1
mad	1
bweed	1
you	1
Wostovs	1
are!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
noticed	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
In	1
April	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
enlivened	1
by	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
arrival,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
had	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
review	1
he	1
held	1
at	1
Bartenstein,	1
as	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
outposts	1
far	1
beyond	1
that	1
place.	1
	1
They	1
were	1
bivouacking.	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Rostov	1
were	1
living	1
in	1
an	1
earth	1
hut,	1
dug	1
out	1
for	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
roofed	1
with	1
branches	1
and	1
turf.	1
The	1
hut	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
manner,	1
which	1
had	1
then	1
come	1
into	1
vogue.	1
A	1
trench	1
was	1
dug	1
three	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
feet	1
wide,	1
four	1
feet	1
eight	1
inches	1
deep,	1
and	1
eight	1
feet	1
long.	1
At	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
trench,	1
steps	1
were	1
cut	1
out	1
and	1
these	1
formed	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
vestibule.	1
The	1
trench	1
itself	1
was	1
the	1
room,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
lucky	1
ones,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
had	1
a	1
board,	1
lying	1
on	1
piles	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
opposite	1
the	1
entrance,	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
table.	1
On	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
trench,	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
cut	1
out	1
to	1
a	1
breadth	1
of	1
about	1
two	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
feet,	1
and	1
this	1
did	1
duty	1
for	1
bedsteads	1
and	1
couches.	1
The	1
roof	1
was	1
so	1
constructed	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
trench	1
and	1
could	1
even	1
sit	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
beds	1
if	1
one	1
drew	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
was	1
living	1
luxuriously	1
because	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
his	1
squadron	1
liked	1
him,	1
had	1
also	1
a	1
board	1
in	1
the	1
roof	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
end,	1
with	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
(broken	1
but	1
mended)	1
glass	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
window.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
cold,	1
embers	1
from	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
campfire	1
were	1
placed	1
on	1
a	1
bent	1
sheet	1
of	1
iron	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
"reception	1
room"--as	1
Denisov	1
called	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hut--and	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
so	1
warm	1
that	1
the	1
officers,	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
always	1
some	1
with	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
sat	1
in	1
their	1
shirt	1
sleeves.	1
	1
In	1
April,	1
Rostov	1
was	1
on	1
orderly	1
duty.	1
One	1
morning,	1
between	1
seven	1
and	1
eight,	1
returning	1
after	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night,	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
embers,	1
changed	1
his	1
rain-soaked	1
underclothes,	1
said	1
his	1
prayers,	1
drank	1
tea,	1
got	1
warm,	1
then	1
tidied	1
up	1
the	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
corner,	1
and,	1
his	1
face	1
glowing	1
from	1
exposure	1
to	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
with	1
nothing	1
on	1
but	1
his	1
shirt,	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
putting	1
his	1
arms	1
under	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
was	1
pleasantly	1
considering	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
being	1
promoted	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
for	1
his	1
last	1
reconnoitering	1
expedition,	1
and	1
was	1
awaiting	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
somewhere	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
wanted	1
a	1
talk.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
Denisov	1
shouting	1
in	1
a	1
vibrating	1
voice	1
behind	1
the	1
hut,	1
evidently	1
much	1
excited.	1
Rostov	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
see	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
to,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
quartermaster,	1
Topcheenko.	1
	1
"I	1
ordered	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
eat	1
that	1
Mashka	1
woot	1
stuff!"	1
Denisov	1
was	1
shouting.	1
"And	1
I	1
saw	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
how	1
Lazarchuk	1
bwought	1
some	1
fwom	1
the	1
fields."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
order	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
your	1
honor,	1
but	1
they	1
don't	1
obey,"	1
answered	1
the	1
quartermaster.	1
	1
Rostov	1
lay	1
down	1
again	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
and	1
thought	1
complacently:	1
"Let	1
him	1
fuss	1
and	1
bustle	1
now,	1
my	1
job's	1
done	1
and	1
I'm	1
lying	1
down--capitally!"	1
He	1
could	1
hear	1
that	1
Lavrushka--that	1
sly,	1
bold	1
orderly	1
of	1
Denisov's--was	1
talking,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
quartermaster.	1
Lavrushka	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
about	1
loaded	1
wagons,	1
biscuits,	1
and	1
oxen	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
for	1
provisions.	1
	1
Then	1
Denisov's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
shouting	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
away.	1
"Saddle!	1
Second	1
platoon!"	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
they	1
off	1
to	1
now?"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later,	1
Denisov	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
hut,	1
climbed	1
with	1
muddy	1
boots	1
on	1
the	1
bed,	1
lit	1
his	1
pipe,	1
furiously	1
scattered	1
his	1
things	1
about,	1
took	1
his	1
leaded	1
whip,	1
buckled	1
on	1
his	1
saber,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
again.	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
inquiry	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
he	1
answered	1
vaguely	1
and	1
crossly	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
business.	1
	1
"Let	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
gweat	1
monarch	1
judge	1
me	1
afterwards!"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
going	1
out,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
heard	1
the	1
hoofs	1
of	1
several	1
horses	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
trouble	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
Denisov	1
had	1
gone.	1
Having	1
got	1
warm	1
in	1
his	1
corner,	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
hut	1
till	1
toward	1
evening.	1
Denisov	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
returned.	1
The	1
weather	1
had	1
cleared	1
up,	1
and	1
near	1
the	1
next	1
hut	1
two	1
officers	1
and	1
a	1
cadet	1
were	1
playing	1
svayka,	1
laughing	1
as	1
they	1
threw	1
their	1
missiles	1
which	1
buried	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
soft	1
mud.	1
Rostov	1
joined	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
game,	1
the	1
officers	1
saw	1
some	1
wagons	1
approaching	1
with	1
fifteen	1
hussars	1
on	1
their	1
skinny	1
horses	1
behind	1
them.	1
The	1
wagons	1
escorted	1
by	1
the	1
hussars	1
drew	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
picket	1
ropes	1
and	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
hussars	1
surrounded	1
them.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
Denisov	1
has	1
been	1
worrying,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
"and	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
provisions."	1
	1
"So	1
they	1
are!"	1
said	1
the	1
officers.	1
"Won't	1
the	1
soldiers	1
be	1
glad!"	1
	1
A	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
hussars	1
came	1
Denisov,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
two	1
infantry	1
officers	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
talking.	1
	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
	1
"I	1
warn	1
you,	1
Captain,"	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
a	1
short	1
thin	1
man,	1
evidently	1
very	1
angry,	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"Haven't	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
won't	1
give	1
them	1
up?"	1
replied	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
Captain.	1
It	1
is	1
mutiny--seizing	1
the	1
transport	1
of	1
one's	1
own	1
army.	1
Our	1
men	1
have	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat	1
for	1
two	1
days."	1
	1
"And	1
mine	1
have	1
had	1
nothing	1
for	1
two	1
weeks,"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
robbery!	1
You'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
sir!"	1
said	1
the	1
infantry	1
officer,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"Now,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
pestewing	1
me	1
for?"	1
cried	1
Denisov,	1
suddenly	1
losing	1
his	1
temper.	1
"I	1
shall	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
not	1
you,	1
and	1
you'd	1
better	1
not	1
buzz	1
about	1
here	1
till	1
you	1
get	1
hurt.	1
Be	1
off!	1
Go!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
at	1
the	1
officers.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
then!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
little	1
officer,	1
undaunted	1
and	1
not	1
riding	1
away.	1
"If	1
you	1
are	1
determined	1
to	1
rob,	1
I'll..."	1
	1
"Go	1
to	1
the	1
devil!	1
quick	1
ma'ch,	1
while	1
you're	1
safe	1
and	1
sound!"	1
and	1
Denisov	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
on	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
very	1
well!"	1
muttered	1
the	1
officer,	1
threateningly,	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
trotted	1
away,	1
jolting	1
in	1
his	1
saddle.	1
	1
"A	1
dog	1
astwide	1
a	1
fence!	1
A	1
weal	1
dog	1
astwide	1
a	1
fence!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov	1
after	1
him	1
(the	1
most	1
insulting	1
expression	1
a	1
cavalryman	1
can	1
address	1
to	1
a	1
mounted	1
infantryman)	1
and	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
he	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
	1
"I've	1
taken	1
twansports	1
from	1
the	1
infantwy	1
by	1
force!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"After	1
all,	1
can't	1
let	1
our	1
men	1
starve."	1
	1
The	1
wagons	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
hussars	1
had	1
been	1
consigned	1
to	1
an	1
infantry	1
regiment,	1
but	1
learning	1
from	1
Lavrushka	1
that	1
the	1
transport	1
was	1
unescorted,	1
Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
hussars	1
had	1
seized	1
it	1
by	1
force.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
had	1
biscuits	1
dealt	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
freely,	1
and	1
they	1
even	1
shared	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
squadrons.	1
	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
sent	1
for	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
holding	1
his	1
fingers	1
spread	1
out	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
said:	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
affair:	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
won't	1
begin	1
proceedings,	1
but	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
ride	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
staff	1
and	1
settle	1
the	1
business	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
commissariat	1
department	1
and	1
if	1
possible	1
sign	1
a	1
receipt	1
for	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
stores	1
received.	1
If	1
not,	1
as	1
the	1
demand	1
was	1
booked	1
against	1
an	1
infantry	1
regiment,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
row	1
and	1
the	1
affair	1
may	1
end	1
badly."	1
	1
From	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander's,	1
Denisov	1
rode	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
staff	1
with	1
a	1
sincere	1
desire	1
to	1
act	1
on	1
this	1
advice.	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
dugout	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
such	1
as	1
Rostov	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
seen	1
him	1
in.	1
Denisov	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
and	1
gasped	1
for	1
breath.	1
When	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter,	1
he	1
only	1
uttered	1
some	1
incoherent	1
oaths	1
and	1
threats	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse,	1
feeble	1
voice.	1
	1
Alarmed	1
at	1
Denisov's	1
condition,	1
Rostov	1
suggested	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
undress,	1
drink	1
some	1
water,	1
and	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
"Twy	1
me	1
for	1
wobbewy...	1
oh!	1
Some	1
more	1
water...	1
Let	1
them	1
twy	1
me,	1
but	1
I'll	1
always	1
thwash	1
scoundwels...	1
and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
the	1
Empewo'...	1
Ice..."	1
he	1
muttered.	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
doctor,	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
bleed	1
Denisov.	1
A	1
deep	1
saucer	1
of	1
black	1
blood	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
his	1
hairy	1
arm	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
was	1
he	1
able	1
to	1
relate	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
get	1
there,"	1
began	1
Denisov.	1
"'Now	1
then,	1
where's	1
your	1
chief's	1
quarters?'	1
They	1
were	1
pointed	1
out.	1
'Please	1
to	1
wait.'	1
'I've	1
widden	1
twenty	1
miles	1
and	1
have	1
duties	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
and	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
wait.	1
Announce	1
me.'	1
Vewy	1
well,	1
so	1
out	1
comes	1
their	1
head	1
chief--also	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
lecture	1
me:	1
'It's	1
wobbewy!'--'Wobbewy,'	1
I	1
say,	1
'is	1
not	1
done	1
by	1
man	1
who	1
seizes	1
pwovisions	1
to	1
feed	1
his	1
soldiers,	1
but	1
by	1
him	1
who	1
takes	1
them	1
to	1
fill	1
his	1
own	1
pockets!'	1
'Will	1
you	1
please	1
be	1
silent?'	1
'Vewy	1
good!'	1
Then	1
he	1
says:	1
'Go	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
weceipt	1
to	1
the	1
commissioner,	1
but	1
your	1
affair	1
will	1
be	1
passed	1
on	1
to	1
headquarters.'	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
commissioner.	1
I	1
enter,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
table...	1
who	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
No,	1
but	1
wait	1
a	1
bit!...	1
Who	1
is	1
it	1
that's	1
starving	1
us?"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
hitting	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
fist	1
of	1
his	1
newly	1
bled	1
arm	1
so	1
violently	1
that	1
the	1
table	1
nearly	1
broke	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
tumblers	1
on	1
it	1
jumped	1
about.	1
"Telyanin!	1
'What?	1
So	1
it's	1
you	1
who's	1
starving	1
us	1
to	1
death!	1
Is	1
it?	1
Take	1
this	1
and	1
this!'	1
and	1
I	1
hit	1
him	1
so	1
pat,	1
stwaight	1
on	1
his	1
snout...	1
'Ah,	1
what	1
a...	1
what	1
a...!'	1
and	1
I	1
sta'ted	1
fwashing	1
him...	1
Well,	1
I've	1
had	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
fun	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you!"	1
cried	1
Denisov,	1
gleeful	1
and	1
yet	1
angry,	1
his	1
white	1
teeth	1
showing	1
under	1
his	1
black	1
mustache.	1
"I'd	1
have	1
killed	1
him	1
if	1
they	1
hadn't	1
taken	1
him	1
away!"	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
shouting	1
for?	1
Calm	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"You've	1
set	1
your	1
arm	1
bleeding	1
afresh.	1
Wait,	1
we	1
must	1
tie	1
it	1
up	1
again."	1
	1
Denisov	1
was	1
bandaged	1
up	1
again	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
bed.	1
Next	1
day	1
he	1
woke	1
calm	1
and	1
cheerful.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
noon	1
the	1
adjutant	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
came	1
into	1
Rostov's	1
and	1
Denisov's	1
dugout	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
and	1
serious	1
face	1
and	1
regretfully	1
showed	1
them	1
a	1
paper	1
addressed	1
to	1
Major	1
Denisov	1
from	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
in	1
which	1
inquiries	1
were	1
made	1
about	1
yesterday's	1
occurrence.	1
The	1
adjutant	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
turn:	1
that	1
a	1
court-martial	1
had	1
been	1
appointed,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
severity	1
with	1
which	1
marauding	1
and	1
insubordination	1
were	1
now	1
regarded,	1
degradation	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
hoped	1
for.	1
	1
The	1
case,	1
as	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
offended	1
parties,	1
was	1
that,	1
after	1
seizing	1
the	1
transports,	1
Major	1
Denisov,	1
being	1
drunk,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
quartermaster	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
provocation	1
called	1
him	1
a	1
thief,	1
threatened	1
to	1
strike	1
him,	1
and	1
on	1
being	1
led	1
out	1
had	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
office	1
and	1
given	1
two	1
officials	1
a	1
thrashing,	1
and	1
dislocated	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
renewed	1
questions,	1
Denisov	1
said,	1
laughing,	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
some	1
other	1
fellow	1
had	1
got	1
mixed	1
up	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
nonsense	1
and	1
rubbish,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
fear	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
trial,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
those	1
scoundrels	1
dared	1
attack	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
an	1
answer	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
easily	1
forget.	1
	1
Denisov	1
spoke	1
contemptuously	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
matter,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
knew	1
him	1
too	1
well	1
not	1
to	1
detect	1
that	1
(while	1
hiding	1
it	1
from	1
others)	1
at	1
heart	1
he	1
feared	1
a	1
court-martial	1
and	1
was	1
worried	1
over	1
the	1
affair,	1
which	1
was	1
evidently	1
taking	1
a	1
bad	1
turn.	1
Every	1
day,	1
letters	1
of	1
inquiry	1
and	1
notices	1
from	1
the	1
court	1
arrived,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
May,	1
Denisov	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
hand	1
the	1
squadron	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
in	1
seniority	1
and	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
his	1
division	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
violence	1
at	1
the	1
commissariat	1
office.	1
On	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
Platov	1
reconnoitered	1
with	1
two	1
Cossack	1
regiments	1
and	1
two	1
squadrons	1
of	1
hussars.	1
Denisov,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
wont,	1
rode	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
outposts,	1
parading	1
his	1
courage.	1
A	1
bullet	1
fired	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
sharpshooter	1
hit	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
fleshy	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
leg.	1
Perhaps	1
at	1
another	1
time	1
Denisov	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
regiment	1
for	1
so	1
slight	1
a	1
wound,	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
excuse	1
himself	1
from	1
appearing	1
at	1
the	1
staff	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
hospital.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
In	1
June	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Friedland	1
was	1
fought,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
part,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
an	1
armistice	1
was	1
proclaimed.	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
felt	1
his	1
friend's	1
absence	1
very	1
much,	1
having	1
no	1
news	1
of	1
him	1
since	1
he	1
left	1
and	1
feeling	1
very	1
anxious	1
about	1
his	1
wound	1
and	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
his	1
affairs,	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
armistice	1
to	1
get	1
leave	1
to	1
visit	1
Denisov	1
in	1
hospital.	1
	1
The	1
hospital	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
Prussian	1
town	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
twice	1
devastated	1
by	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
troops.	1
Because	1
it	1
was	1
summer,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
beautiful	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
the	1
little	1
town	1
presented	1
a	1
particularly	1
dismal	1
appearance	1
with	1
its	1
broken	1
roofs	1
and	1
fences,	1
its	1
foul	1
streets,	1
tattered	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
drunken	1
soldiers	1
wandering	1
about.	1
	1
The	1
hospital	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
brick	1
building	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
frames	1
and	1
panes	1
broken	1
and	1
a	1
courtyard	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
wooden	1
fence	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
pulled	1
to	1
pieces.	1
Several	1
bandaged	1
soldiers,	1
with	1
pale	1
swollen	1
faces,	1
were	1
sitting	1
or	1
walking	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
in	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
Directly	1
Rostov	1
entered	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
was	1
enveloped	1
by	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
putrefaction	1
and	1
hospital	1
air.	1
On	1
the	1
stairs	1
he	1
met	1
a	1
Russian	1
army	1
doctor	1
smoking	1
a	1
cigar.	1
The	1
doctor	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
Russian	1
assistant.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
tear	1
myself	1
to	1
pieces,"	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
saying.	1
"Come	1
to	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
there."	1
	1
The	1
assistant	1
asked	1
some	1
further	1
questions.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
do	1
the	1
best	1
you	1
can!	1
Isn't	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
same?"	1
The	1
doctor	1
noticed	1
Rostov	1
coming	1
upstairs.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
sir?"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want?	1
The	1
bullets	1
having	1
spared	1
you,	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
try	1
typhus?	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
pesthouse,	1
sir."	1
	1
"How	1
so?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Typhus,	1
sir.	1
It's	1
death	1
to	1
go	1
in.	1
Only	1
we	1
two,	1
Makeev	1
and	1
I"	1
(he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
assistant),	1
"keep	1
on	1
here.	1
Some	1
five	1
of	1
us	1
doctors	1
have	1
died	1
in	1
this	1
place....	1
When	1
a	1
new	1
one	1
comes	1
he	1
is	1
done	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
week,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
with	1
evident	1
satisfaction.	1
"Prussian	1
doctors	1
have	1
been	1
invited	1
here,	1
but	1
our	1
allies	1
don't	1
like	1
it	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
Rostov	1
explained	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
Major	1
Denisov	1
of	1
the	1
hussars,	1
who	1
was	1
wounded.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know.	1
I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you,	1
sir.	1
Only	1
think!	1
I	1
am	1
alone	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
three	1
hospitals	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
hundred	1
patients!	1
It's	1
well	1
that	1
the	1
charitable	1
Prussian	1
ladies	1
send	1
us	1
two	1
pounds	1
of	1
coffee	1
and	1
some	1
lint	1
each	1
month	1
or	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
lost!"	1
he	1
laughed.	1
"Four	1
hundred,	1
sir,	1
and	1
they're	1
always	1
sending	1
me	1
fresh	1
ones.	1
There	1
are	1
four	1
hundred?	1
Eh?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
assistant.	1
	1
The	1
assistant	1
looked	1
fagged	1
out.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
vexed	1
and	1
impatient	1
for	1
the	1
talkative	1
doctor	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
"Major	1
Denisov,"	1
Rostov	1
said	1
again.	1
"He	1
was	1
wounded	1
at	1
Molliten."	1
	1
"Dead,	1
I	1
fancy.	1
Eh,	1
Makeev?"	1
queried	1
the	1
doctor,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
indifference.	1
	1
The	1
assistant,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
confirm	1
the	1
doctor's	1
words.	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
tall	1
and	1
with	1
reddish	1
hair?"	1
asked	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
Rostov	1
described	1
Denisov's	1
appearance.	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
one	1
like	1
that,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
as	1
if	1
pleased.	1
"That	1
one	1
is	1
dead,	1
I	1
fancy.	1
However,	1
I'll	1
look	1
up	1
our	1
list.	1
We	1
had	1
a	1
list.	1
Have	1
you	1
got	1
it,	1
Makeev?"	1
	1
"Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
has	1
the	1
list,"	1
answered	1
the	1
assistant.	1
"But	1
if	1
you'll	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
officers'	1
wards	1
you'll	1
see	1
for	1
yourself,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you'd	1
better	1
not	1
go,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
"or	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
stay	1
here	1
yourself."	1
	1
But	1
Rostov	1
bowed	1
himself	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
assistant	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
"Only	1
don't	1
blame	1
me!"	1
the	1
doctor	1
shouted	1
up	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
Rostov	1
and	1
the	1
assistant	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
corridor.	1
The	1
smell	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
there	1
that	1
Rostov	1
held	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
pause	1
and	1
collect	1
his	1
strength	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
go	1
on.	1
A	1
door	1
opened	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
and	1
an	1
emaciated	1
sallow	1
man	1
on	1
crutches,	1
barefoot	1
and	1
in	1
underclothing,	1
limped	1
out	1
and,	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
doorpost,	1
looked	1
with	1
glittering	1
envious	1
eyes	1
at	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
passing.	1
Glancing	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded	1
were	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
on	1
straw	1
and	1
overcoats.	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
look?"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
see?"	1
said	1
the	1
assistant.	1
	1
But,	1
just	1
because	1
the	1
assistant	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
in,	1
Rostov	1
entered	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
ward.	1
The	1
foul	1
air,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
get	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
corridor,	1
was	1
still	1
stronger	1
here.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
different,	1
more	1
pungent,	1
and	1
one	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
where	1
it	1
originated.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
long	1
room,	1
brightly	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
through	1
the	1
large	1
windows,	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded	1
lay	1
in	1
two	1
rows	1
with	1
their	1
heads	1
to	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
leaving	1
a	1
passage	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
Most	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
unconscious	1
and	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
newcomers.	1
Those	1
who	1
were	1
conscious	1
raised	1
themselves	1
or	1
lifted	1
their	1
thin	1
yellow	1
faces,	1
and	1
all	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
Rostov	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
hope,	1
of	1
relief,	1
reproach,	1
and	1
envy	1
of	1
another's	1
health.	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
looking	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
doors	1
into	1
the	1
two	1
adjoining	1
rooms	1
saw	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
there.	1
He	1
stood	1
still,	1
looking	1
silently	1
around.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
expected	1
such	1
a	1
sight.	1
Just	1
before	1
him,	1
almost	1
across	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
floor,	1
lay	1
a	1
sick	1
man,	1
probably	1
a	1
Cossack	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
cut	1
of	1
his	1
hair.	1
The	1
man	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
his	1
huge	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
outstretched.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
purple,	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
rolled	1
back	1
so	1
that	1
only	1
the	1
whites	1
were	1
seen,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
bare	1
legs	1
and	1
arms	1
which	1
were	1
still	1
red,	1
the	1
veins	1
stood	1
out	1
like	1
cords.	1
He	1
was	1
knocking	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
floor,	1
hoarsely	1
uttering	1
some	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
kept	1
repeating.	1
Rostov	1
listened	1
and	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
word.	1
It	1
was	1
"drink,	1
drink,	1
a	1
drink!"	1
Rostov	1
glanced	1
round,	1
looking	1
for	1
someone	1
who	1
would	1
put	1
this	1
man	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
water.	1
	1
"Who	1
looks	1
after	1
the	1
sick	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
assistant.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
a	1
commissariat	1
soldier,	1
a	1
hospital	1
orderly,	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room,	1
marching	1
stiffly,	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Good	1
day,	1
your	1
honor!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
rolling	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
Rostov	1
and	1
evidently	1
mistaking	1
him	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hospital	1
authorities.	1
	1
"Get	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
water,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
honor,"	1
the	1
soldier	1
replied	1
complacently,	1
and	1
rolling	1
his	1
eyes	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
still	1
straighter,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
impossible	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
here,"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
out,	1
but	1
became	1
aware	1
of	1
an	1
intense	1
look	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
right,	1
and	1
he	1
turned.	1
Close	1
to	1
the	1
corner,	1
on	1
an	1
overcoat,	1
sat	1
an	1
old,	1
unshaven,	1
gray-bearded	1
soldier	1
as	1
thin	1
as	1
a	1
skeleton,	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
sallow	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
intently	1
fixed	1
on	1
Rostov.	1
The	1
man's	1
neighbor	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
whispered	1
something	1
to	1
him,	1
pointing	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
drew	1
nearer	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
leg	1
bent	1
under	1
him,	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
been	1
amputated	1
above	1
the	1
knee.	1
His	1
neighbor	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
who	1
lay	1
motionless	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
thrown	1
back,	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
snub	1
nose.	1
His	1
pale	1
waxen	1
face	1
was	1
still	1
freckled	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
rolled	1
back.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
soldier	1
and	1
a	1
cold	1
chill	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
back.	1
	1
"Why,	1
this	1
one	1
seems..."	1
he	1
began,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
assistant.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
we've	1
been	1
begging,	1
your	1
honor,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
soldier,	1
his	1
jaw	1
quivering.	1
"He's	1
been	1
dead	1
since	1
morning.	1
After	1
all	1
we're	1
men,	1
not	1
dogs."	1
	1
"I'll	1
send	1
someone	1
at	1
once.	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away--taken	1
away	1
at	1
once,"	1
said	1
the	1
assistant	1
hurriedly.	1
"Let	1
us	1
go,	1
your	1
honor."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
let	1
us	1
go,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
hastily,	1
and	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
shrinking,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
pass	1
unnoticed	1
between	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
reproachful	1
envious	1
eyes	1
that	1
were	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Going	1
along	1
the	1
corridor,	1
the	1
assistant	1
led	1
Rostov	1
to	1
the	1
officers'	1
wards,	1
consisting	1
of	1
three	1
rooms,	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
which	1
stood	1
open.	1
There	1
were	1
beds	1
in	1
these	1
rooms	1
and	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded	1
officers	1
were	1
lying	1
or	1
sitting	1
on	1
them.	1
Some	1
were	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
hospital	1
dressing	1
gowns.	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
Rostov	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
officers'	1
ward	1
was	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
one	1
arm,	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
first	1
room	1
in	1
a	1
nightcap	1
and	1
hospital	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
with	1
a	1
pipe	1
between	1
his	1
teeth.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
before.	1
	1
"See	1
where	1
we've	1
met	1
again!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
man.	1
"Tushin,	1
Tushin,	1
don't	1
you	1
remember,	1
who	1
gave	1
you	1
a	1
lift	1
at	1
Schon	1
Grabern?	1
And	1
I've	1
had	1
a	1
bit	1
cut	1
off,	1
you	1
see..."	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
empty	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown.	1
"Looking	1
for	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich	1
Denisov?	1
My	1
neighbor,"	1
he	1
added,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
who	1
Rostov	1
wanted.	1
"Here,	1
here,"	1
and	1
Tushin	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room,	1
from	1
whence	1
came	1
sounds	1
of	1
several	1
laughing	1
voices.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
they	1
laugh,	1
or	1
even	1
live	1
at	1
all	1
here?"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
still	1
aware	1
of	1
that	1
smell	1
of	1
decomposing	1
flesh	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
ward,	1
and	1
still	1
seeming	1
to	1
see	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
those	1
envious	1
looks	1
which	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
both	1
sides,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
soldier	1
with	1
eyes	1
rolled	1
back.	1
	1
Denisov	1
lay	1
asleep	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
under	1
the	1
blanket,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
nearly	1
noon.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Wostov?	1
How	1
are	1
you,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
he	1
called	1
out,	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
voice	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
noticed	1
sadly	1
that	1
under	1
this	1
habitual	1
ease	1
and	1
animation	1
some	1
new,	1
sinister,	1
hidden	1
feeling	1
showed	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
intonations	1
of	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
His	1
wound,	1
though	1
a	1
slight	1
one,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
healed	1
even	1
now,	1
six	1
weeks	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
hit.	1
His	1
face	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
swollen	1
pallor	1
as	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
hospital	1
patients,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
that	1
struck	1
Rostov.	1
What	1
struck	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
Denisov	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
smiled	1
at	1
him	1
unnaturally.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
about	1
the	1
regiment,	1
nor	1
about	1
the	1
general	1
state	1
of	1
affairs,	1
and	1
when	1
Rostov	1
spoke	1
of	1
these	1
matters	1
did	1
not	1
listen.	1
	1
Rostov	1
even	1
noticed	1
that	1
Denisov	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
reminded	1
of	1
the	1
regiment,	1
or	1
in	1
general	1
of	1
that	1
other	1
free	1
life	1
which	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
outside	1
the	1
hospital.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
forget	1
that	1
old	1
life	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
affair	1
with	1
the	1
commissariat	1
officers.	1
On	1
Rostov's	1
inquiry	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
stood,	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
produced	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
pillow	1
a	1
paper	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
commission	1
and	1
the	1
rough	1
draft	1
of	1
his	1
answer	1
to	1
it.	1
He	1
became	1
animated	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
reading	1
his	1
paper	1
and	1
specially	1
drew	1
Rostov's	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
stinging	1
rejoinders	1
he	1
made	1
to	1
his	1
enemies.	1
His	1
hospital	1
companions,	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
round	1
Rostov--a	1
fresh	1
arrival	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
outside--gradually	1
began	1
to	1
disperse	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Denisov	1
began	1
reading	1
his	1
answer.	1
Rostov	1
noticed	1
by	1
their	1
faces	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
gentlemen	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
that	1
story	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
and	1
were	1
tired	1
of	1
it.	1
Only	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
next	1
bed,	1
a	1
stout	1
Uhlan,	1
continued	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
his	1
bed,	1
gloomily	1
frowning	1
and	1
smoking	1
a	1
pipe,	1
and	1
little	1
one-armed	1
Tushin	1
still	1
listened,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
disapprovingly.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
reading,	1
the	1
Uhlan	1
interrupted	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
is,"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
"it	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
simply	1
to	1
petition	1
the	1
Emperor	1
for	1
pardon.	1
They	1
say	1
great	1
rewards	1
will	1
now	1
be	1
distributed,	1
and	1
surely	1
a	1
pardon	1
would	1
be	1
granted...."	1
	1
"Me	1
petition	1
the	1
Empewo'!"	1
exclaimed	1
Denisov,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
old	1
energy	1
and	1
fire,	1
but	1
which	1
sounded	1
like	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
irritable	1
impotence.	1
"What	1
for?	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
a	1
wobber	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
mercy,	1
but	1
I'm	1
being	1
court-martialed	1
for	1
bwinging	1
wobbers	1
to	1
book.	1
Let	1
them	1
twy	1
me,	1
I'm	1
not	1
afwaid	1
of	1
anyone.	1
I've	1
served	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
my	1
countwy	1
honowably	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
stolen!	1
And	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
be	1
degwaded?...	1
Listen,	1
I'm	1
w'iting	1
to	1
them	1
stwaight.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
say:	1
'If	1
I	1
had	1
wobbed	1
the	1
Tweasuwy...'"	1
	1
"It's	1
certainly	1
well	1
written,"	1
said	1
Tushin,	1
"but	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
point,	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich,"	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
turned	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
"One	1
has	1
to	1
submit,	1
and	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich	1
doesn't	1
want	1
to.	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
auditor	1
told	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
business."	1
	1
"Well,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
bad,"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"The	1
auditor	1
wrote	1
out	1
a	1
petition	1
for	1
you,"	1
continued	1
Tushin,	1
"and	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
sign	1
it	1
and	1
ask	1
this	1
gentleman	1
to	1
take	1
it.	1
No	1
doubt	1
he"	1
(indicating	1
Rostov)	1
"has	1
connections	1
on	1
the	1
staff.	1
You	1
won't	1
find	1
a	1
better	1
opportunity."	1
	1
"Haven't	1
I	1
said	1
I'm	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
gwovel?"	1
Denisov	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
his	1
paper.	1
	1
Rostov	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
persuade	1
Denisov,	1
though	1
he	1
instinctively	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
advised	1
by	1
Tushin	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
officers	1
was	1
the	1
safest,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
He	1
knew	1
his	1
stubborn	1
will	1
and	1
straightforward	1
hasty	1
temper.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
virulent	1
reply,	1
which	1
took	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
hour,	1
was	1
over,	1
Rostov	1
said	1
nothing,	1
and	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
dejected	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
amid	1
Denisov's	1
hospital	1
comrades,	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
round	1
him,	1
telling	1
them	1
what	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
their	1
stories.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
moodily	1
silent	1
all	1
the	1
evening.	1
	1
Late	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
when	1
Rostov	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
leave,	1
he	1
asked	1
Denisov	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
commission	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
wait	1
a	1
bit,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
glancing	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
papers	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
pillow	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
inkpot,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
write.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
it's	1
no	1
use	1
knocking	1
one's	1
head	1
against	1
a	1
wall!"	1
he	1
said,	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
giving	1
Rostov	1
a	1
large	1
envelope.	1
In	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
petition	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
drawn	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
auditor,	1
in	1
which	1
Denisov,	1
without	1
alluding	1
to	1
the	1
offenses	1
of	1
the	1
commissariat	1
officials,	1
simply	1
asked	1
for	1
pardon.	1
	1
"Hand	1
it	1
in.	1
It	1
seems..."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish,	1
but	1
gave	1
a	1
painfully	1
unnatural	1
smile.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
Having	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
commander	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
affairs,	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
to	1
Tilsit	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
of	1
June	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
Russian	1
Emperors	1
arrived	1
in	1
Tilsit.	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
important	1
personage	1
on	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
attendance,	1
to	1
include	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
suite	1
appointed	1
for	1
the	1
stay	1
at	1
Tilsit.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
man,"	1
he	1
said,	1
alluding	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
whom	1
hitherto	1
he,	1
like	1
everyone	1
else,	1
had	1
always	1
called	1
Buonaparte.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
Buonaparte?"	1
asked	1
the	1
general,	1
smiling.	1
	1
Boris	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
general	1
inquiringly	1
and	1
immediately	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
tested.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
speaking,	1
Prince,	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon,"	1
he	1
replied.	1
The	1
general	1
patted	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
go	1
far,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
Tilsit	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
Boris	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
few	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
Niemen	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
two	1
Emperors	1
met.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
raft,	1
decorated	1
with	1
monograms,	1
saw	1
Napoleon	1
pass	1
before	1
the	1
French	1
Guards	1
on	1
the	1
farther	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
saw	1
the	1
pensive	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
silence	1
in	1
a	1
tavern	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Niemen	1
awaiting	1
Napoleon's	1
arrival,	1
saw	1
both	1
Emperors	1
get	1
into	1
boats,	1
and	1
saw	1
how	1
Napoleon--reaching	1
the	1
raft	1
first--stepped	1
quickly	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
Alexander	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
both	1
retired	1
into	1
the	1
pavilion.	1
Since	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
move	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
circles	1
Boris	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
his	1
habit	1
to	1
watch	1
attentively	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
on	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
note	1
it	1
down.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
at	1
Tilsit	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
uniforms	1
they	1
wore,	1
and	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
words	1
spoken	1
by	1
important	1
personages.	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
Emperors	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
pavilion	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
again	1
when	1
Alexander	1
came	1
out.	1
The	1
interview	1
had	1
lasted	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
fifty-	1
three	1
minutes.	1
He	1
noted	1
this	1
down	1
that	1
same	1
evening,	1
among	1
other	1
facts	1
he	1
felt	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
historic	1
importance.	1
As	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
suite	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
one,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
importance,	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
valued	1
his	1
success	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Tilsit	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
this	1
interview	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
Emperors,	1
and	1
having	1
succeeded	1
in	1
this,	1
Boris	1
felt	1
that	1
henceforth	1
his	1
position	1
was	1
fully	1
assured.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
become	1
known,	1
but	1
people	1
had	1
grown	1
accustomed	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
accepted	1
him.	1
Twice	1
he	1
had	1
executed	1
commissions	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
knew	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
at	1
court,	1
far	1
from	1
cold-shouldering	1
him	1
as	1
at	1
first	1
when	1
they	1
considered	1
him	1
a	1
newcomer,	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
been	1
surprised	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
absent.	1
	1
Boris	1
lodged	1
with	1
another	1
adjutant,	1
the	1
Polish	1
Count	1
Zhilinski.	1
Zhilinski,	1
a	1
Pole	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
Paris,	1
was	1
rich,	1
and	1
passionately	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
stay	1
at	1
Tilsit,	1
French	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Guard	1
and	1
from	1
French	1
headquarters	1
were	1
dining	1
and	1
lunching	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
Boris.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-fourth	1
of	1
June,	1
Count	1
Zhilinski	1
arranged	1
a	1
supper	1
for	1
his	1
French	1
friends.	1
The	1
guest	1
of	1
honor	1
was	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
of	1
Napoleon's,	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
several	1
French	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Guard,	1
and	1
a	1
page	1
of	1
Napoleon's,	1
a	1
young	1
lad	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
aristocratic	1
French	1
family.	1
That	1
same	1
day,	1
Rostov,	1
profiting	1
by	1
the	1
darkness	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
recognized	1
in	1
civilian	1
dress,	1
came	1
to	1
Tilsit	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
lodging	1
occupied	1
by	1
Boris	1
and	1
Zhilinski.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
came,	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
experienced	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
feeling	1
toward	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
the	1
French-	1
-who	1
from	1
being	1
foes	1
had	1
suddenly	1
become	1
friends--that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
at	1
headquarters	1
and	1
in	1
Boris.	1
In	1
the	1
army,	1
Bonaparte	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
still	1
regarded	1
with	1
mingled	1
feelings	1
of	1
anger,	1
contempt,	1
and	1
fear.	1
Only	1
recently,	1
talking	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
Platov's	1
Cossack	1
officers,	1
Rostov	1
had	1
argued	1
that	1
if	1
Napoleon	1
were	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
treated	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
sovereign,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
criminal.	1
Quite	1
lately,	1
happening	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
wounded	1
French	1
colonel	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
Rostov	1
had	1
maintained	1
with	1
heat	1
that	1
peace	1
was	1
impossible	1
between	1
a	1
legitimate	1
sovereign	1
and	1
the	1
criminal	1
Bonaparte.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
therefore	1
unpleasantly	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
French	1
officers	1
in	1
Boris'	1
lodging,	1
dressed	1
in	1
uniforms	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
see	1
from	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
from	1
the	1
outposts	1
of	1
the	1
flank.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
French	1
officer,	1
who	1
thrust	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
that	1
warlike	1
feeling	1
of	1
hostility	1
which	1
he	1
always	1
experienced	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
suddenly	1
seized	1
him.	1
He	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
threshold	1
and	1
asked	1
in	1
Russian	1
whether	1
Drubetskoy	1
lived	1
there.	1
Boris,	1
hearing	1
a	1
strange	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
An	1
expression	1
of	1
annoyance	1
showed	1
itself	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
on	1
first	1
recognizing	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
it's	1
you?	1
Very	1
glad,	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
however,	1
coming	1
toward	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
But	1
Rostov	1
had	1
noticed	1
his	1
first	1
impulse.	1
	1
"I've	1
come	1
at	1
a	1
bad	1
time	1
I	1
think.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
come,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
business,"	1
he	1
said	1
coldly.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
only	1
wonder	1
how	1
you	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
your	1
regiment.	1
Dans	1
un	1
moment	1
je	1
suis	1
a	1
vous,"	1
*	1
he	1
said,	1
answering	1
someone	1
who	1
called	1
him.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"In	1
a	1
minute	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
your	1
disposal."	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
I'm	1
intruding,"	1
Rostov	1
repeated.	1
	1
The	1
look	1
of	1
annoyance	1
had	1
already	1
disappeared	1
from	1
Boris'	1
face:	1
having	1
evidently	1
reflected	1
and	1
decided	1
how	1
to	1
act,	1
he	1
very	1
quietly	1
took	1
both	1
Rostov's	1
hands	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
His	1
eyes,	1
looking	1
serenely	1
and	1
steadily	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
veiled	1
by	1
something,	1
as	1
if	1
screened	1
by	1
blue	1
spectacles	1
of	1
conventionality.	1
So	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
come	1
now!	1
As	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
come	1
at	1
a	1
wrong	1
time!"	1
said	1
Boris,	1
and	1
he	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
supper	1
table	1
was	1
laid	1
and	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
guests,	1
explaining	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
civilian,	1
but	1
an	1
hussar	1
officer,	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
his.	1
	1
"Count	1
Zhilinski--le	1
Comte	1
N.	1
N.--le	1
Capitaine	1
S.	1
S.,"	1
said	1
he,	1
naming	1
his	1
guests.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
frowningly	1
at	1
the	1
Frenchmen,	1
bowed	1
reluctantly,	1
and	1
remained	1
silent.	1
	1
Zhilinski	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
receive	1
this	1
new	1
Russian	1
person	1
very	1
willingly	1
into	1
his	1
circle	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
Boris	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
constraint	1
the	1
newcomer	1
produced	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
pleasant	1
composure	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
veiled	1
look	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
Rostov,	1
tried	1
to	1
enliven	1
the	1
conversation.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchmen,	1
with	1
the	1
politeness	1
characteristic	1
of	1
his	1
countrymen,	1
addressed	1
the	1
obstinately	1
taciturn	1
Rostov,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
probably	1
come	1
to	1
Tilsit	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
came	1
on	1
business,"	1
replied	1
Rostov,	1
briefly.	1
	1
Rostov	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
humor	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
noticed	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
on	1
Boris'	1
face,	1
and	1
as	1
always	1
happens	1
to	1
those	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
humor,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
everyone	1
regarded	1
him	1
with	1
aversion	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
everybody's	1
way.	1
He	1
really	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
way,	1
for	1
he	1
alone	1
took	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
which	1
again	1
became	1
general.	1
The	1
looks	1
the	1
visitors	1
cast	1
on	1
him	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"And	1
what	1
is	1
he	1
sitting	1
here	1
for?"	1
He	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Boris.	1
	1
"Anyhow,	1
I'm	1
in	1
your	1
way,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
tone.	1
"Come	1
and	1
talk	1
over	1
my	1
business	1
and	1
I'll	1
go	1
away."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
not	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Boris.	1
"But	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
tired,	1
come	1
and	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
rest."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
really..."	1
	1
They	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
room	1
where	1
Boris	1
slept.	1
Rostov,	1
without	1
sitting	1
down,	1
began	1
at	1
once,	1
irritably	1
(as	1
if	1
Boris	1
were	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
some	1
way)	1
telling	1
him	1
about	1
Denisov's	1
affair,	1
asking	1
him	1
whether,	1
through	1
his	1
general,	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
would	1
intercede	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
on	1
Denisov's	1
behalf	1
and	1
get	1
Denisov's	1
petition	1
handed	1
in.	1
When	1
he	1
and	1
Boris	1
were	1
alone,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
Boris	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
without	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
awkwardness.	1
Boris,	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
crossed	1
over	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
stroking	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
with	1
the	1
slender	1
fingers	1
of	1
his	1
right,	1
listened	1
to	1
Rostov	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
listens	1
to	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
a	1
subordinate,	1
now	1
looking	1
aside	1
and	1
now	1
gazing	1
straight	1
into	1
Rostov's	1
eyes	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
veiled	1
look.	1
Each	1
time	1
this	1
happened	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
cast	1
down	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
cases	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
His	1
Majesty	1
is	1
very	1
severe	1
in	1
such	1
affairs.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
not	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
but	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
corps....	1
But	1
in	1
general,	1
I	1
think..."	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
anything?	1
Well	1
then,	1
say	1
so!"	1
Rostov	1
almost	1
shouted,	1
not	1
looking	1
Boris	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
Boris	1
smiled.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
can.	1
Only	1
I	1
thought..."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Zhilinski's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
calling	1
Boris.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
go,	1
go,	1
go..."	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
refusing	1
supper	1
and	1
remaining	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
room,	1
he	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
hearing	1
the	1
lighthearted	1
French	1
conversation	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
Rostov	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Tilsit	1
the	1
day	1
least	1
suitable	1
for	1
a	1
petition	1
on	1
Denisov's	1
behalf.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
himself	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
in	1
attendance	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
mufti	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Tilsit	1
without	1
permission	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
Boris,	1
even	1
had	1
he	1
wished	1
to,	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
day.	1
On	1
that	1
day,	1
June	1
27,	1
the	1
preliminaries	1
of	1
peace	1
were	1
signed.	1
The	1
Emperors	1
exchanged	1
decorations:	1
Alexander	1
received	1
the	1
Cross	1
of	1
the	1
Legion	1
of	1
Honor	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
Andrew	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Degree,	1
and	1
a	1
dinner	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
for	1
the	1
evening,	1
given	1
by	1
a	1
battalion	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Guards	1
to	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
battalion.	1
The	1
Emperors	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
that	1
banquet.	1
	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
so	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
uncomfortable	1
with	1
Boris	1
that,	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
looked	1
in	1
after	1
supper,	1
he	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
asleep,	1
and	1
early	1
next	1
morning	1
went	1
away,	1
avoiding	1
Boris.	1
In	1
his	1
civilian	1
clothes	1
and	1
a	1
round	1
hat,	1
he	1
wandered	1
about	1
the	1
town,	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
their	1
uniforms	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
houses	1
where	1
the	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
Emperors	1
were	1
staying.	1
In	1
a	1
square	1
he	1
saw	1
tables	1
being	1
set	1
up	1
and	1
preparations	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
dinner;	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
colors	1
draped	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
streets,	1
with	1
huge	1
monograms	1
A	1
and	1
N.	1
In	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
also	1
flags	1
and	1
bunting	1
were	1
displayed.	1
	1
"Boris	1
doesn't	1
want	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
him.	1
That's	1
settled,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas.	1
"All	1
is	1
over	1
between	1
us,	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
leave	1
here	1
without	1
having	1
done	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
for	1
Denisov	1
and	1
certainly	1
not	1
without	1
getting	1
his	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
The	1
Emperor!...	1
He	1
is	1
here!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
Alexander	1
lodged.	1
	1
Saddled	1
horses	1
were	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
suite	1
were	1
assembling,	1
evidently	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
come	1
out.	1
	1
"I	1
may	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
any	1
moment,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
"If	1
only	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
hand	1
the	1
letter	1
direct	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
all...	1
could	1
they	1
really	1
arrest	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
civilian	1
clothes?	1
Surely	1
not!	1
He	1
would	1
understand	1
on	1
whose	1
side	1
justice	1
lies.	1
He	1
understands	1
everything,	1
knows	1
everything.	1
Who	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
just,	1
more	1
magnanimous	1
than	1
he?	1
And	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
arrest	1
me	1
for	1
being	1
here,	1
what	1
would	1
it	1
matter?"	1
thought	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
was	1
entering	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
Emperor	1
occupied.	1
"After	1
all,	1
people	1
do	1
go	1
in....	1
It's	1
all	1
nonsense!	1
I'll	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
hand	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
myself	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
Drubetskoy	1
who	1
drives	1
me	1
to	1
it!"	1
And	1
suddenly	1
with	1
a	1
determination	1
he	1
himself	1
did	1
not	1
expect,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
won't	1
miss	1
my	1
opportunity	1
now,	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
after	1
Austerlitz,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
expecting	1
every	1
moment	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
monarch,	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
at	1
the	1
thought.	1
"I	1
will	1
fall	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
beseech	1
him.	1
He	1
will	1
lift	1
me	1
up,	1
will	1
listen,	1
and	1
will	1
even	1
thank	1
me.	1
'I	1
am	1
happy	1
when	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
good,	1
but	1
to	1
remedy	1
injustice	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
happiness,'"	1
Rostov	1
fancied	1
the	1
sovereign	1
saying.	1
And	1
passing	1
people	1
who	1
looked	1
after	1
him	1
with	1
curiosity,	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
house.	1
	1
A	1
broad	1
staircase	1
led	1
straight	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
entry,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
closed	1
door.	1
Below,	1
under	1
the	1
staircase,	1
was	1
a	1
door	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
lower	1
floor.	1
	1
"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
someone	1
inquired.	1
	1
"To	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
letter,	1
a	1
petition,	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
with	1
a	1
tremor	1
in	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"A	1
petition?	1
This	1
way,	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
on	1
duty"	1
(he	1
was	1
shown	1
the	1
door	1
leading	1
downstairs),	1
"only	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
accepted."	1
	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
indifferent	1
voice,	1
Rostov	1
grew	1
frightened	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing;	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
meeting	1
the	1
Emperor	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
was	1
so	1
fascinating	1
and	1
consequently	1
so	1
alarming	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
run	1
away,	1
but	1
the	1
official	1
who	1
had	1
questioned	1
him	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
entered.	1
	1
A	1
short	1
stout	1
man	1
of	1
about	1
thirty,	1
in	1
white	1
breeches	1
and	1
high	1
boots	1
and	1
a	1
batiste	1
shirt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
only	1
just	1
put	1
on,	1
standing	1
in	1
that	1
room,	1
and	1
his	1
valet	1
was	1
buttoning	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
breeches	1
a	1
new	1
pair	1
of	1
handsome	1
silk-embroidered	1
braces	1
that,	1
for	1
some	1
reason,	1
attracted	1
Rostov's	1
attention.	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
someone	1
in	1
the	1
adjoining	1
room.	1
	1
"A	1
good	1
figure	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
first	1
bloom,"	1
he	1
was	1
saying,	1
but	1
on	1
seeing	1
Rostov,	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
and	1
frowned.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
A	1
petition?"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
the	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
room.	1
	1
"Another	1
petitioner,"	1
answered	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
braces.	1
	1
"Tell	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
later.	1
He'll	1
be	1
coming	1
out	1
directly,	1
we	1
must	1
go."	1
	1
"Later...	1
later!	1
Tomorrow.	1
It's	1
too	1
late..."	1
	1
Rostov	1
turned	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
braces	1
stopped	1
him.	1
	1
"Whom	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
from?	1
Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
	1
"I	1
come	1
from	1
Major	1
Denisov,"	1
answered	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
an	1
officer?"	1
	1
"Lieutenant	1
Count	1
Rostov."	1
	1
"What	1
audacity!	1
Hand	1
it	1
in	1
through	1
your	1
commander.	1
And	1
go	1
along	1
with	1
you...	1
go,"	1
and	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
uniform	1
the	1
valet	1
handed	1
him.	1
	1
Rostov	1
went	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
noticed	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
officers	1
and	1
generals	1
in	1
full	1
parade	1
uniform,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
Cursing	1
his	1
temerity,	1
his	1
heart	1
sinking	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
finding	1
himself	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
being	1
put	1
to	1
shame	1
and	1
arrested	1
in	1
his	1
presence,	1
fully	1
alive	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
his	1
conduct	1
and	1
repenting	1
of	1
it,	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes,	1
was	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
through	1
the	1
brilliant	1
suite	1
when	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
called	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
hand	1
detained	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
here,	1
sir,	1
in	1
civilian	1
dress?"	1
asked	1
a	1
deep	1
voice.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cavalry	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
obtained	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
special	1
favor	1
during	1
this	1
campaign,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
commanded	1
the	1
division	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
was	1
serving.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
in	1
dismay,	1
began	1
justifying	1
himself,	1
but	1
seeing	1
the	1
kindly,	1
jocular	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
general,	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
aside	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
excited	1
voice	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
affair,	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
intercede	1
for	1
Denisov,	1
whom	1
the	1
general	1
knew.	1
Having	1
heard	1
Rostov	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
general	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
gravely.	1
	1
"I'm	1
sorry,	1
sorry	1
for	1
that	1
fine	1
fellow.	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
letter."	1
	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Rostov	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
finished	1
explaining	1
Denisov's	1
case,	1
when	1
hasty	1
steps	1
and	1
the	1
jingling	1
of	1
spurs	1
were	1
heard	1
on	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
the	1
general,	1
leaving	1
him,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
suite	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
horses.	1
Hayne,	1
the	1
same	1
groom	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Austerlitz,	1
led	1
up	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
horse,	1
and	1
the	1
faint	1
creak	1
of	1
a	1
footstep	1
Rostov	1
knew	1
at	1
once	1
was	1
heard	1
on	1
the	1
stairs.	1
Forgetting	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
recognized,	1
Rostov	1
went	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
porch,	1
together	1
with	1
some	1
inquisitive	1
civilians,	1
and	1
again,	1
after	1
two	1
years,	1
saw	1
those	1
features	1
he	1
adored:	1
that	1
same	1
face	1
and	1
same	1
look	1
and	1
step,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
union	1
of	1
majesty	1
and	1
mildness....	1
And	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
enthusiasm	1
and	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
sovereign	1
rose	1
again	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
soul	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
old	1
force.	1
In	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
regiment--white	1
chamois-leather	1
breeches	1
and	1
high	1
boots--	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
star	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
(it	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Legion	1
d'honneur),	1
the	1
monarch	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch,	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
gloves	1
and	1
carrying	1
his	1
hat	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
He	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
him,	1
brightening	1
everything	1
around	1
by	1
his	1
glance.	1
He	1
spoke	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
generals,	1
and,	1
recognizing	1
the	1
former	1
commander	1
of	1
Rostov's	1
division,	1
smiled	1
and	1
beckoned	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
suite	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
general	1
talking	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
toward	1
his	1
horse.	1
Again	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
and	1
street	1
gazers	1
(among	1
whom	1
was	1
Rostov)	1
moved	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
Stopping	1
beside	1
his	1
horse,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
saddle,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
cavalry	1
general	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
by	1
all:	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
do	1
it,	1
General.	1
I	1
cannot,	1
because	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
stronger	1
than	1
I,"	1
and	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
stirrup.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
respectfully,	1
and	1
the	1
monarch	1
mounted	1
and	1
rode	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
at	1
a	1
gallop.	1
Beside	1
himself	1
with	1
enthusiasm,	1
Rostov	1
ran	1
after	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
square	1
where,	1
facing	1
one	1
another,	1
a	1
battalion	1
of	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
regiment	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
a	1
battalion	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Guards	1
in	1
their	1
bearskin	1
caps	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
As	1
the	1
Tsar	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
one	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
battalions,	1
which	1
presented	1
arms,	1
another	1
group	1
of	1
horsemen	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
flank,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
them	1
Rostov	1
recognized	1
Napoleon.	1
It	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
one	1
else.	1
He	1
came	1
at	1
a	1
gallop,	1
wearing	1
a	1
small	1
hat,	1
a	1
blue	1
uniform	1
open	1
over	1
a	1
white	1
vest,	1
and	1
the	1
St.	1
Andrew	1
ribbon	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
He	1
was	1
riding	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
thoroughbred	1
gray	1
Arab	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
crimson	1
gold-embroidered	1
saddlecloth.	1
On	1
approaching	1
Alexander	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
his	1
cavalryman's	1
eye,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
noticing	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
sit	1
well	1
or	1
firmly	1
in	1
the	1
saddle.	1
The	1
battalions	1
shouted	1
"Hurrah!"	1
and	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
Napoleon	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
Alexander,	1
and	1
both	1
Emperors	1
dismounted	1
and	1
took	1
each	1
other's	1
hands.	1
Napoleon's	1
face	1
wore	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
artificial	1
smile.	1
Alexander	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
affable	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
trampling	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
gendarmes'	1
horses,	1
which	1
were	1
pushing	1
back	1
the	1
crowd,	1
Rostov	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
Alexander	1
and	1
Bonaparte.	1
It	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
surprise	1
that	1
Alexander	1
treated	1
Bonaparte	1
as	1
an	1
equal	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
quite	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
the	1
Tsar,	1
as	1
if	1
such	1
relations	1
with	1
an	1
Emperor	1
were	1
an	1
everyday	1
matter	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Alexander	1
and	1
Napoleon,	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
train	1
of	1
their	1
suites,	1
approached	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
battalion	1
and	1
came	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
crowd	1
standing	1
there.	1
The	1
crowd	1
unexpectedly	1
found	1
itself	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
Emperors	1
that	1
Rostov,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
row,	1
was	1
afraid	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
recognized.	1
	1
"Sire,	1
I	1
ask	1
your	1
permission	1
to	1
present	1
the	1
Legion	1
of	1
Honor	1
to	1
the	1
bravest	1
of	1
your	1
soldiers,"	1
said	1
a	1
sharp,	1
precise	1
voice,	1
articulating	1
every	1
letter.	1
	1
This	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
the	1
undersized	1
Napoleon,	1
looking	1
up	1
straight	1
into	1
Alexander's	1
eyes.	1
Alexander	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
bending	1
his	1
head,	1
smiled	1
pleasantly.	1
	1
"To	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
borne	1
himself	1
most	1
bravely	1
in	1
this	1
last	1
war,"	1
added	1
Napoleon,	1
accentuating	1
each	1
syllable,	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
composure	1
and	1
assurance	1
exasperating	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
he	1
ran	1
his	1
eyes	1
over	1
the	1
Russian	1
ranks	1
drawn	1
up	1
before	1
him,	1
who	1
all	1
presented	1
arms	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
their	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"Will	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
consult	1
the	1
colonel?"	1
said	1
Alexander	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
few	1
hasty	1
steps	1
toward	1
Prince	1
Kozlovski,	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
battalion.	1
	1
Bonaparte	1
meanwhile	1
began	1
taking	1
the	1
glove	1
off	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hand,	1
tore	1
it	1
in	1
doing	1
so,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
away.	1
An	1
aide-de-camp	1
behind	1
him	1
rushed	1
forward	1
and	1
picked	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
"To	1
whom	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
given?"	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
asked	1
Koslovski,	1
in	1
Russian	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
	1
"To	1
whomever	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
commands."	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
knit	1
his	1
brows	1
with	1
dissatisfaction	1
and,	1
glancing	1
back,	1
remarked:	1
	1
"But	1
we	1
must	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
answer."	1
	1
Kozlovski	1
scanned	1
the	1
ranks	1
resolutely	1
and	1
included	1
Rostov	1
in	1
his	1
scrutiny.	1
	1
"Can	1
it	1
be	1
me?"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Lazarev!"	1
the	1
colonel	1
called,	1
with	1
a	1
frown,	1
and	1
Lazarev,	1
the	1
first	1
soldier	1
in	1
the	1
rank,	1
stepped	1
briskly	1
forward.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?	1
Stop	1
here!"	1
voices	1
whispered	1
to	1
Lazarev	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
go.	1
Lazarev	1
stopped,	1
casting	1
a	1
sidelong	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
colonel	1
in	1
alarm.	1
His	1
face	1
twitched,	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
to	1
soldiers	1
called	1
before	1
the	1
ranks.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
slightly	1
turned	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
plump	1
little	1
hand	1
out	1
behind	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
take	1
something.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
his	1
suite,	1
guessing	1
at	1
once	1
what	1
he	1
wanted,	1
moved	1
about	1
and	1
whispered	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
something	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
a	1
page--the	1
same	1
one	1
Rostov	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
at	1
Boris'--ran	1
forward	1
and,	1
bowing	1
respectfully	1
over	1
the	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
and	1
not	1
keeping	1
it	1
waiting	1
a	1
moment,	1
laid	1
in	1
it	1
an	1
Order	1
on	1
a	1
red	1
ribbon.	1
Napoleon,	1
without	1
looking,	1
pressed	1
two	1
fingers	1
together	1
and	1
the	1
badge	1
was	1
between	1
them.	1
Then	1
he	1
approached	1
Lazarev	1
(who	1
rolled	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
persistently	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
monarch),	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
to	1
imply	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
doing	1
was	1
done	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
ally,	1
and	1
the	1
small	1
white	1
hand	1
holding	1
the	1
Order	1
touched	1
one	1
of	1
Lazarev's	1
buttons.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
Napoleon	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
necessary	1
for	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
deign	1
to	1
touch	1
that	1
soldier's	1
breast	1
for	1
the	1
soldier	1
to	1
be	1
forever	1
happy,	1
rewarded,	1
and	1
distinguished	1
from	1
everyone	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Napoleon	1
merely	1
laid	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
Lazarev's	1
breast	1
and,	1
dropping	1
his	1
hand,	1
turned	1
toward	1
Alexander	1
as	1
though	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
cross	1
would	1
adhere	1
there.	1
And	1
it	1
really	1
did.	1
	1
Officious	1
hands,	1
Russian	1
and	1
French,	1
immediately	1
seized	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
fastened	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
uniform.	1
Lazarev	1
glanced	1
morosely	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
white	1
hands	1
who	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
still	1
standing	1
motionless	1
presenting	1
arms,	1
looked	1
again	1
straight	1
into	1
Alexander's	1
eyes,	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
should	1
stand	1
there,	1
or	1
go	1
away,	1
or	1
do	1
something	1
else.	1
But	1
receiving	1
no	1
orders,	1
he	1
remained	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
that	1
rigid	1
position.	1
	1
The	1
Emperors	1
remounted	1
and	1
rode	1
away.	1
The	1
Preobrazhensk	1
battalion,	1
breaking	1
rank,	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
Guards	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
tables	1
prepared	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
Lazarev	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
honor.	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
officers	1
embraced	1
him,	1
congratulated	1
him,	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
hands.	1
Crowds	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
civilians	1
drew	1
near	1
merely	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
A	1
rumble	1
of	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
voices	1
and	1
laughter	1
filled	1
the	1
air	1
round	1
the	1
tables	1
in	1
the	1
square.	1
Two	1
officers	1
with	1
flushed	1
faces,	1
looking	1
cheerful	1
and	1
happy,	1
passed	1
by	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"What	1
d'you	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
treat?	1
All	1
on	1
silver	1
plate,"	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
saying.	1
"Have	1
you	1
seen	1
Lazarev?"	1
	1
"I	1
have."	1
	1
"Tomorrow,	1
I	1
hear,	1
the	1
Preobrazhenskis	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
dinner."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
what	1
luck	1
for	1
Lazarev!	1
Twelve	1
hundred	1
francs'	1
pension	1
for	1
life."	1
	1
"Here's	1
a	1
cap,	1
lads!"	1
shouted	1
a	1
Preobrazhensk	1
soldier,	1
donning	1
a	1
shaggy	1
French	1
cap.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
fine	1
thing!	1
First-rate!"	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
heard	1
the	1
password?"	1
asked	1
one	1
Guards'	1
officer	1
of	1
another.	1
"The	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
it	1
was	1
'Napoleon,	1
France,	1
bravoure';	1
yesterday,	1
'Alexandre,	1
Russie,	1
grandeur.'	1
One	1
day	1
our	1
Emperor	1
gives	1
it	1
and	1
next	1
day	1
Napoleon.	1
Tomorrow	1
our	1
Emperor	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
St.	1
George's	1
Cross	1
to	1
the	1
bravest	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Guards.	1
It	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
He	1
must	1
respond	1
in	1
kind."	1
	1
Boris,	1
too,	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
Zhilinski,	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
banquet.	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
back,	1
he	1
noticed	1
Rostov	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
house.	1
	1
"Rostov!	1
How	1
d'you	1
do?	1
We	1
missed	1
one	1
another,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
asking	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter,	1
so	1
strangely	1
dismal	1
and	1
troubled	1
was	1
Rostov's	1
face.	1
	1
"Nothing,	1
nothing,"	1
replied	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"You'll	1
call	1
round?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
will."	1
	1
Rostov	1
stood	1
at	1
that	1
corner	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
watching	1
the	1
feast	1
from	1
a	1
distance.	1
In	1
his	1
mind,	1
a	1
painful	1
process	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion.	1
Terrible	1
doubts	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
Now	1
he	1
remembered	1
Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
changed	1
expression,	1
his	1
submission,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
hospital,	1
with	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
torn	1
off	1
and	1
its	1
dirt	1
and	1
disease.	1
So	1
vividly	1
did	1
he	1
recall	1
that	1
hospital	1
stench	1
of	1
dead	1
flesh	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
where	1
the	1
smell	1
came	1
from.	1
Next	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
self-	1
satisfied	1
Bonaparte,	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hand,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
an	1
Emperor,	1
liked	1
and	1
respected	1
by	1
Alexander.	1
Then	1
why	1
those	1
severed	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
and	1
those	1
dead	1
men?...	1
Then	1
again	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
Lazarev	1
rewarded	1
and	1
Denisov	1
punished	1
and	1
unpardoned.	1
He	1
caught	1
himself	1
harboring	1
such	1
strange	1
thoughts	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
frightened.	1
	1
The	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
food	1
the	1
Preobrazhenskis	1
were	1
eating	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
hunger	1
recalled	1
him	1
from	1
these	1
reflections;	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
before	1
going	1
away.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
hotel	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
morning.	1
There	1
he	1
found	1
so	1
many	1
people,	1
among	1
them	1
officers	1
who,	1
like	1
himself,	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
civilian	1
clothes,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
difficulty	1
in	1
getting	1
a	1
dinner.	1
Two	1
officers	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
division	1
joined	1
him.	1
The	1
conversation	1
naturally	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
peace.	1
The	1
officers,	1
his	1
comrades,	1
like	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
were	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
peace	1
concluded	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Friedland.	1
They	1
said	1
that	1
had	1
we	1
held	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
Napoleon	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
for,	1
as	1
his	1
troops	1
had	1
neither	1
provisions	1
nor	1
ammunition.	1
Nicholas	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1
(chiefly	1
the	1
latter)	1
in	1
silence.	1
He	1
finished	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine	1
by	1
himself.	1
The	1
process	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
went	1
on	1
tormenting	1
him	1
without	1
reaching	1
a	1
conclusion.	1
He	1
feared	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
yet	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
them.	1
Suddenly,	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers'	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
humiliating	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
French,	1
Rostov	1
began	1
shouting	1
with	1
uncalled-for	1
wrath,	1
and	1
therefore	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
surprise	1
of	1
the	1
officers:	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
judge	1
what's	1
best?"	1
he	1
cried,	1
the	1
blood	1
suddenly	1
rushing	1
to	1
his	1
face.	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
judge	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
actions?	1
What	1
right	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
argue?	1
We	1
cannot	1
comprehend	1
either	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
aims	1
or	1
his	1
actions!"	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
the	1
Emperor!"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
justifying	1
himself,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
Rostov's	1
outburst,	1
except	1
on	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
drunk.	1
	1
But	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
not	1
diplomatic	1
officials,	1
we	1
are	1
soldiers	1
and	1
nothing	1
more,"	1
he	1
went	1
on.	1
"If	1
we	1
are	1
ordered	1
to	1
die,	1
we	1
must	1
die.	1
If	1
we're	1
punished,	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
deserved	1
it,	1
it's	1
not	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
judge.	1
If	1
the	1
Emperor	1
pleases	1
to	1
recognize	1
Bonaparte	1
as	1
Emperor	1
and	1
to	1
conclude	1
an	1
alliance	1
with	1
him,	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
to	1
do.	1
If	1
once	1
we	1
begin	1
judging	1
and	1
arguing	1
about	1
everything,	1
nothing	1
sacred	1
will	1
be	1
left!	1
That	1
way	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saying	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God--nothing!"	1
shouted	1
Nicholas,	1
banging	1
the	1
table--very	1
little	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
his	1
listeners,	1
but	1
quite	1
relevantly	1
to	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts.	1
	1
"Our	1
business	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
our	1
duty,	1
to	1
fight	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
think!	1
That's	1
all...."	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"And	1
to	1
drink,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
quarrel.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
to	1
drink,"	1
assented	1
Nicholas.	1
"Hullo	1
there!	1
Another	1
bottle!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
In	1
1808	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
went	1
to	1
Erfurt	1
for	1
a	1
fresh	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
circles	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
this	1
important	1
meeting.	1

	1
In	1
1809	1
the	1
intimacy	1
between	1
"the	1
world's	1
two	1
arbiters,"	1
as	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
Alexander	1
were	1
called,	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
when	1
Napoleon	1
declared	1
war	1
on	1
Austria	1
a	1
Russian	1
corps	1
crossed	1
the	1
frontier	1
to	1
co-operate	1
with	1
our	1
old	1
enemy	1
Bonaparte	1
against	1
our	1
old	1
ally	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Austria,	1
and	1
in	1

circles	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
marriage	1
between	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
Alexander's	1
sisters	1
was	1
spoken	1
of.	1
But	1
besides	1
considerations	1
of	1
foreign	1
policy,	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
Russian	1
society	1
was	1
at	1
that	1

keenly	1
directed	1
on	1
the	1

with	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
spent	1
two	1
years	1
continuously	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
plans	1
Pierre	1
had	1
attempted	1
on	1
his	1
estates--and	1
constantly	1
changing	1
from	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
another	1
had	1
never	1
accomplished--were	1
carried	1
out	1
by	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
without	1
display	1
and	1
without	1
perceptible	1
difficulty.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
a	1
practical	1
tenacity	1
which	1
Pierre	1
lacked,	1
and	1
without	1
fuss	1
or	1
strain	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
this	1
set	1
things	1
going.	1
	1
On	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
estates	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
serfs	1
were	1
liberated	1
and	1
became	1
free	1
agricultural	1
laborers--this	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
examples	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
in	1
Russia.	1
On	1
other	1
estates	1
the	1
serfs'	1
compulsory	1
labor	1
was	1
commuted	1
for	1
a	1
quitrent.	1
A	1
trained	1
midwife	1
was	1
engaged	1
for	1
Bogucharovo	1
at	1
his	1
expense,	1
and	1
a	1
priest	1
was	1
paid	1
to	1
teach	1
reading	1
and	1
writing	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
household	1
serfs.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
spent	1
half	1
his	1
time	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
nurses.	1
The	1
other	1
half	1
he	1
spent	1
in	1
"Bogucharovo	1
Cloister,"	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
called	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
estate.	1
Despite	1
the	1
indifference	1
to	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
had	1
expressed	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
he	1
diligently	1
followed	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
on,	1
received	1
many	1
books,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
noticed	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
or	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
visitors	1
from	1
Petersburg,	1
the	1
very	1
vortex	1
of	1
life,	1
these	1
people	1
lagged	1
behind	1
himself-	1
-who	1
never	1
left	1
the	1
country--in	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
home	1
and	1
foreign	1
affairs.	1
	1
Besides	1
being	1
occupied	1
with	1
his	1
estates	1
and	1
reading	1
a	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
books,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
busy	1
with	1
a	1
critical	1
survey	1
of	1
our	1
last	1
two	1
unfortunate	1
campaigns,	1
and	1
with	1
drawing	1
up	1
a	1
proposal	1
for	1
a	1
reform	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
rules	1
and	1
regulations.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
1809	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
estates	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
inherited	1
by	1
his	1
son,	1
whose	1
guardian	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
Warmed	1
by	1
the	1
spring	1
sunshine	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
caleche	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
grass,	1
the	1
first	1
leaves	1
on	1
the	1
birches,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
puffs	1
of	1
white	1
spring	1
clouds	1
floating	1
across	1
the	1
clear	1
blue	1
sky.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
anything,	1
but	1
looked	1
absent-mindedly	1
and	1
cheerfully	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side.	1
	1
They	1
crossed	1
the	1
ferry	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
with	1
Pierre	1
the	1
year	1
before.	1
They	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
muddy	1
village,	1
past	1
threshing	1
floors	1
and	1
green	1
fields	1
of	1
winter	1
rye,	1
downhill	1
where	1
snow	1
still	1
lodged	1
near	1
the	1
bridge,	1
uphill	1
where	1
the	1
clay	1
had	1
been	1
liquefied	1
by	1
the	1
rain,	1
past	1
strips	1
of	1
stubble	1
land	1
and	1
bushes	1
touched	1
with	1
green	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
and	1
into	1
a	1
birch	1
forest	1
growing	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
In	1
the	1
forest	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
hot,	1
no	1
wind	1
could	1
be	1
felt.	1
The	1
birches	1
with	1
their	1
sticky	1
green	1
leaves	1
were	1
motionless,	1
and	1
lilac-colored	1
flowers	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
blades	1
of	1
green	1
grass	1
were	1
pushing	1
up	1
and	1
lifting	1
last	1
year's	1
leaves.	1
The	1
coarse	1
evergreen	1
color	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
fir	1
trees	1
scattered	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
among	1
the	1
birches	1
was	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
reminder	1
of	1
winter.	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
forest	1
the	1
horses	1
began	1
to	1
snort	1
and	1
sweated	1
visibly.	1
	1
Peter	1
the	1
footman	1
made	1
some	1
remark	1
to	1
the	1
coachman;	1
the	1
latter	1
assented.	1
But	1
apparently	1
the	1
coachman's	1
sympathy	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
Peter,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
toward	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
"How	1
pleasant	1
it	1
is,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
respectful	1
smile.	1
	1
"What?"	1
	1
"It's	1
pleasant,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
he	1
talking	1
about?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
spring,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
round.	1
"Yes,	1
really	1
everything	1
is	1
green	1
already....	1
How	1
early!	1
The	1
birches	1
and	1
cherry	1
and	1
alders	1
too	1
are	1
coming	1
out....	1
But	1
the	1
oaks	1
show	1
no	1
sign	1
yet.	1
Ah,	1
here	1
is	1
one	1
oak!"	1
	1
At	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
stood	1
an	1
oak.	1
Probably	1
ten	1
times	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
the	1
birches	1
that	1
formed	1
the	1
forest,	1
it	1
was	1
ten	1
times	1
as	1
thick	1
and	1
twice	1
as	1
tall	1
as	1
they.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
enormous	1
tree,	1
its	1
girth	1
twice	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
embrace,	1
and	1
evidently	1
long	1
ago	1
some	1
of	1
its	1
branches	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
off	1
and	1
its	1
bark	1
scarred.	1
With	1
its	1
huge	1
ungainly	1
limbs	1
sprawling	1
unsymmetrically,	1
and	1
its	1
gnarled	1
hands	1
and	1
fingers,	1
it	1
stood	1
an	1
aged,	1
stern,	1
and	1
scornful	1
monster	1
among	1
the	1
smiling	1
birch	1
trees.	1
Only	1
the	1
dead-looking	1
evergreen	1
firs	1
dotted	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
this	1
oak,	1
refused	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
spring	1
or	1
notice	1
either	1
the	1
spring	1
or	1
the	1
sunshine.	1
	1
"Spring,	1
love,	1
happiness!"	1
this	1
oak	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
"Are	1
you	1
not	1
weary	1
of	1
that	1
stupid,	1
meaningless,	1
constantly	1
repeated	1
fraud?	1
Always	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
always	1
a	1
fraud?	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
spring,	1
no	1
sun,	1
no	1
happiness!	1
Look	1
at	1
those	1
cramped	1
dead	1
firs,	1
ever	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
at	1
me	1
too,	1
sticking	1
out	1
my	1
broken	1
and	1
barked	1
fingers	1
just	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
grown,	1
whether	1
from	1
my	1
back	1
or	1
my	1
sides:	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
grown	1
so	1
I	1
stand,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
your	1
hopes	1
and	1
your	1
lies."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
turned	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
oak,	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
something	1
from	1
it.	1
Under	1
the	1
oak,	1
too,	1
were	1
flowers	1
and	1
grass,	1
but	1
it	1
stood	1
among	1
them	1
scowling,	1
rigid,	1
misshapen,	1
and	1
grim	1
as	1
ever.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
oak	1
is	1
right,	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
right,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Let	1
others--the	1
young--yield	1
afresh	1
to	1
that	1
fraud,	1
but	1
we	1
know	1
life,	1
our	1
life	1
is	1
finished!"	1
	1
A	1
whole	1
sequence	1
of	1
new	1
thoughts,	1
hopeless	1
but	1
mournfully	1
pleasant,	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
that	1
tree.	1
During	1
this	1
journey	1
he,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
considered	1
his	1
life	1
afresh	1
and	1
arrived	1
at	1
his	1
old	1
conclusion,	1
restful	1
in	1
its	1
hopelessness:	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
begin	1
anything	1
anew--but	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
live	1
out	1
his	1
life,	1
content	1
to	1
do	1
no	1
harm,	1
and	1
not	1
disturbing	1
himself	1
or	1
desiring	1
anything.	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Marshal	1
of	1
the	1
Nobility	1
for	1
the	1
district	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
estate	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
trustee.	1
This	1
Marshal	1
was	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
May	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
to	1
visit	1
him.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
hot	1
spring	1
weather.	1
The	1
whole	1
forest	1
was	1
already	1
clothed	1
in	1
green.	1
It	1
was	1
dusty	1
and	1
so	1
hot	1
that	1
on	1
passing	1
near	1
water	1
one	1
longed	1
to	1
bathe.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
depressed	1
and	1
preoccupied	1
with	1
the	1
business	1
about	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Marshal,	1
was	1
driving	1
up	1
the	1
avenue	1
in	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
at	1
Otradnoe.	1
He	1
heard	1
merry	1
girlish	1
cries	1
behind	1
some	1
trees	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
girls	1
running	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
his	1
caleche.	1
Ahead	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
ran	1
a	1
dark-	1
haired,	1
remarkably	1
slim,	1
pretty	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
yellow	1
chintz	1
dress,	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
handkerchief	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
from	1
under	1
which	1
loose	1
locks	1
of	1
hair	1
escaped.	1
The	1
girl	1
was	1
shouting	1
something	1
but,	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
stranger,	1
ran	1
back	1
laughing	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
Suddenly,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
why,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
pang.	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
so	1
beautiful,	1
the	1
sun	1
so	1
bright,	1
everything	1
around	1
so	1
gay,	1
but	1
that	1
slim	1
pretty	1
girl	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
or	1
wish	1
to	1
know,	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
was	1
contented	1
and	1
cheerful	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
separate--probably	1
foolish--but	1
bright	1
and	1
happy	1
life.	1
"What	1
is	1
she	1
so	1
glad	1
about?	1
What	1
is	1
she	1
thinking	1
of?	1
Not	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
regulations	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
serfs'	1
quitrents.	1
Of	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
thinking?	1
Why	1
is	1
she	1
so	1
happy?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
himself	1
with	1
instinctive	1
curiosity.	1
	1
In	1
1809	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
was	1
living	1
at	1
Otradnoe	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
former	1
years,	1
that	1
is,	1
entertaining	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
province	1
with	1
hunts,	1
theatricals,	1
dinners,	1
and	1
music.	1
He	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
new	1
visitor,	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
his	1
staying	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
dull	1
day,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
entertained	1
by	1
his	1
elderly	1
hosts	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
of	1
the	1
visitors	1
(the	1
old	1
count's	1
house	1
was	1
crowded	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
an	1
approaching	1
name	1
day),	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
repeatedly	1
glanced	1
at	1
Natasha,	1
gay	1
and	1
laughing	1
among	1
the	1
younger	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
and	1
asked	1
himself	1
each	1
time,	1
"What	1
is	1
she	1
thinking	1
about?	1
Why	1
is	1
she	1
so	1
glad?"	1
	1
That	1
night,	1
alone	1
in	1
new	1
surroundings,	1
he	1
was	1
long	1
unable	1
to	1
sleep.	1
He	1
read	1
awhile	1
and	1
then	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
candle,	1
but	1
relit	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
hot	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
the	1
inside	1
shutters	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
closed.	1
He	1
was	1
cross	1
with	1
the	1
stupid	1
old	1
man	1
(as	1
he	1
called	1
Rostov),	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
stay	1
by	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
some	1
necessary	1
documents	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
arrived	1
from	1
town,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
vexed	1
with	1
himself	1
for	1
having	1
stayed.	1
	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
shutters	1
the	1
moonlight,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
watching	1
for	1
this,	1
burst	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
casement.	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
fresh,	1
bright,	1
and	1
very	1
still.	1
Just	1
before	1
the	1
window	1
was	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
pollard	1
trees,	1
looking	1
black	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
silvery	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
Beneath	1
the	1
trees	1
grew	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
lush,	1
wet,	1
bushy	1
vegetation	1
with	1
silver-lit	1
leaves	1
and	1
stems	1
here	1
and	1
there.	1
Farther	1
back	1
beyond	1
the	1
dark	1
trees	1
a	1
roof	1
glittered	1
with	1
dew,	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
was	1
a	1
leafy	1
tree	1
with	1
brilliantly	1
white	1
trunk	1
and	1
branches,	1
and	1
above	1
it	1
shone	1
the	1
moon,	1
nearly	1
at	1
its	1
full,	1
in	1
a	1
pale,	1
almost	1
starless,	1
spring	1
sky.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
ledge	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
rested	1
on	1
that	1
sky.	1
	1
His	1
room	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
floor.	1
Those	1
in	1
the	1
rooms	1
above	1
were	1
also	1
awake.	1
He	1
heard	1
female	1
voices	1
overhead.	1
	1
"Just	1
once	1
more,"	1
said	1
a	1
girlish	1
voice	1
above	1
him	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
recognized	1
at	1
once.	1
	1
"But	1
when	1
are	1
you	1
coming	1
to	1
bed?"	1
replied	1
another	1
voice.	1
	1
"I	1
won't,	1
I	1
can't	1
sleep,	1
what's	1
the	1
use?	1
Come	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time."	1
	1
	1
Two	1
girlish	1
voices	1
sang	1
a	1
musical	1
passage--the	1
end	1
of	1
some	1
song.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
lovely!	1
Now	1
go	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
there's	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it."	1
	1
"You	1
go	1
to	1
sleep,	1
but	1
I	1
can't,"	1
said	1
the	1
first	1
voice,	1
coming	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
She	1
was	1
evidently	1
leaning	1
right	1
out,	1
for	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
even	1
her	1
breathing	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Everything	1
was	1
stone-still,	1
like	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
its	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
shadows.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
too,	1
dared	1
not	1
stir,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
betraying	1
his	1
unintentional	1
presence.	1
	1
"Sonya!	1
Sonya!"	1
he	1
again	1
heard	1
the	1
first	1
speaker.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
sleep?	1
Only	1
look	1
how	1
glorious	1
it	1
is!	1
Ah,	1
how	1
glorious!	1
Do	1
wake	1
up,	1
Sonya!"	1
she	1
said	1
almost	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
voice.	1
"There	1
never,	1
never	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
lovely	1
night	1
before!"	1
	1
Sonya	1
made	1
some	1
reluctant	1
reply.	1
	1
"Do	1
just	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
moon!...	1
Oh,	1
how	1
lovely!	1
Come	1
here....	1
Darling,	1
sweetheart,	1
come	1
here!	1
There,	1
you	1
see?	1
I	1
feel	1
like	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
my	1
heels,	1
putting	1
my	1
arms	1
round	1
my	1
knees	1
like	1
this,	1
straining	1
tight,	1
as	1
tight	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
flying	1
away!	1
Like	1
this...."	1
	1
"Take	1
care,	1
you'll	1
fall	1
out."	1
	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
scuffle	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
disapproving	1
voice:	1
"It's	1
past	1
one	1
o'clock."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
only	1
spoil	1
things	1
for	1
me.	1
All	1
right,	1
go,	1
go!"	1
	1
Again	1
all	1
was	1
silent,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
sitting	1
there.	1
From	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
soft	1
rustle	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
"O	1
God,	1
O	1
God!	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
mean?"	1
she	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed.	1
"To	1
bed	1
then,	1
if	1
it	1
must	1
be!"	1
and	1
she	1
slammed	1
the	1
casement.	1
	1
"For	1
her	1
I	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
not	1
exist!"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
while	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
voice,	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
expecting	1
yet	1
fearing	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
say	1
something	1
about	1
him.	1
"There	1
she	1
is	1
again!	1
As	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
on	1
purpose,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
In	1
his	1
soul	1
there	1
suddenly	1
arose	1
such	1
an	1
unexpected	1
turmoil	1
of	1
youthful	1
thoughts	1
and	1
hopes,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
tenor	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
that	1
unable	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
condition	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep	1
at	1
once.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Next	1
morning,	1
having	1
taken	1
leave	1
of	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
ladies	1
to	1
appear,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
home.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
June	1
when	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
journey	1
he	1
drove	1
into	1
the	1
birch	1
forest	1
where	1
the	1
gnarled	1
old	1
oak	1
had	1
made	1
so	1
strange	1
and	1
memorable	1
an	1
impression	1
on	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
forest	1
the	1
harness	1
bells	1
sounded	1
yet	1
more	1
muffled	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
six	1
weeks	1
before,	1
for	1
now	1
all	1
was	1
thick,	1
shady,	1
and	1
dense,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
firs	1
dotted	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
did	1
not	1
jar	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
beauty	1
but,	1
lending	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
mood	1
around,	1
were	1
delicately	1
green	1
with	1
fluffy	1
young	1
shoots.	1
	1
The	1
whole	1
day	1
had	1
been	1
hot.	1
Somewhere	1
a	1
storm	1
was	1
gathering,	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
cloud	1
had	1
scattered	1
some	1
raindrops	1
lightly,	1
sprinkling	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
the	1
sappy	1
leaves.	1
The	1
left	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
was	1
dark	1
in	1
the	1
shade,	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
glittered	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight,	1
wet	1
and	1
shiny	1
and	1
scarcely	1
swayed	1
by	1
the	1
breeze.	1
Everything	1
was	1
in	1
blossom,	1
the	1
nightingales	1
trilled,	1
and	1
their	1
voices	1
reverberated	1
now	1
near,	1
now	1
far	1
away.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
forest	1
was	1
that	1
oak	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
agreed,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"But	1
where	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
again	1
wondered,	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
without	1
recognizing	1
it	1
he	1
looked	1
with	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
oak	1
he	1
sought.	1
The	1
old	1
oak,	1
quite	1
transfigured,	1
spreading	1
out	1
a	1
canopy	1
of	1
sappy	1
dark-green	1
foliage,	1
stood	1
rapt	1
and	1
slightly	1
trembling	1
in	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
sun.	1
Neither	1
gnarled	1
fingers	1
nor	1
old	1
scars	1
nor	1
old	1
doubts	1
and	1
sorrows	1
were	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
evidence	1
now.	1
Through	1
the	1
hard	1
century-old	1
bark,	1
even	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
twigs,	1
leaves	1
had	1
sprouted	1
such	1
as	1
one	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
the	1
old	1
veteran	1
could	1
have	1
produced.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
oak,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
an	1
unreasoning	1
springtime	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
renewal.	1
All	1
the	1
best	1
moments	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
suddenly	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
memory.	1
Austerlitz	1
with	1
the	1
lofty	1
heavens,	1
his	1
wife's	1
dead	1
reproachful	1
face,	1
Pierre	1
at	1
the	1
ferry,	1
that	1
girl	1
thrilled	1
by	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
that	1
night	1
itself	1
and	1
the	1
moon,	1
and....	1
all	1
this	1
rushed	1
suddenly	1
to	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"No,	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
over	1
at	1
thirty-one!"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
suddenly	1
decided	1
finally	1
and	1
decisively.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
me--everyone	1
must	1
know	1
it:	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
that	1
young	1
girl	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
fly	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
sky,	1
everyone	1
must	1
know	1
me,	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
life	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
lived	1
for	1
myself	1
alone	1
while	1
others	1
live	1
so	1
apart	1
from	1
it,	1
but	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
reflected	1
in	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
they	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
live	1
in	1
harmony!"	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
home	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
that	1
autumn	1
and	1
found	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
reasons	1
for	1
this	1
decision.	1
A	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
sensible	1
and	1
logical	1
considerations	1
showing	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
essential	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
re-enter	1
the	1
service,	1
kept	1
springing	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
understand	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
ever	1
even	1
have	1
doubted	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
taking	1
an	1
active	1
share	1
in	1
life,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
month	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
how	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
leaving	1
the	1
quiet	1
country	1
could	1
ever	1
enter	1
his	1
head.	1
It	1
now	1
seemed	1
clear	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
experience	1
of	1
life	1
must	1
be	1
senselessly	1
wasted	1
unless	1
he	1
applied	1
it	1
to	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
work	1
and	1
again	1
played	1
an	1
active	1
part	1
in	1
life.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
remember	1
how	1
formerly,	1
on	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
similar	1
wretched	1
logical	1
arguments,	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
degrading	1
himself	1
if	1
he	1
now,	1
after	1
the	1
lessons	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
life,	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
being	1
useful	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
happiness	1
or	1
love.	1
Now	1
reason	1
suggested	1
quite	1
the	1
opposite.	1
After	1
that	1
journey	1
to	1
Ryazan	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
country	1
dull;	1
his	1
former	1
pursuits	1
no	1
longer	1
interested	1
him,	1
and	1
often	1
when	1
sitting	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
he	1
got	1
up,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
mirror,	1
and	1
gazed	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
face.	1
Then	1
he	1
would	1
turn	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
his	1
dead	1
Lise,	1
who	1
with	1
hair	1
curled	1
a	1
la	1
grecque	1
looked	1
tenderly	1
and	1
gaily	1
at	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gilt	1
frame.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
say	1
those	1
former	1
terrible	1
words	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
looked	1
simply,	1
merrily,	1
and	1
inquisitively	1
at	1
him.	1
And	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
crossing	1
his	1
arms	1
behind	1
him,	1
long	1
paced	1
the	1
room,	1
now	1
frowning,	1
now	1
smiling,	1
as	1
he	1
reflected	1
on	1
those	1
irrational,	1
inexpressible	1
thoughts,	1
secret	1
as	1
a	1
crime,	1
which	1
altered	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
and	1
were	1
connected	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
fame,	1
with	1
the	1
girl	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
the	1
oak,	1
and	1
woman's	1
beauty	1
and	1
love.	1
And	1
if	1
anyone	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
at	1
such	1
moments	1
he	1
was	1
particularly	1
cold,	1
stern,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
unpleasantly	1
logical.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
entering	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
would	1
say,	1
"little	1
Nicholas	1
can't	1
go	1
out	1
today,	1
it's	1
very	1
cold."	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
hot,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
would	1
reply	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
very	1
dryly	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
"he	1
could	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
smock,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
cold	1
he	1
must	1
wear	1
warm	1
clothes,	1
which	1
were	1
designed	1
for	1
that	1
purpose.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
follows	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
cold;	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
a	1
child	1
who	1
needs	1
fresh	1
air	1
should	1
remain	1
at	1
home,"	1
he	1
would	1
add	1
with	1
extreme	1
logic,	1
as	1
if	1
punishing	1
someone	1
for	1
those	1
secret	1
illogical	1
emotions	1
that	1
stirred	1
within	1
him.	1
	1
At	1
such	1
moments	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
would	1
think	1
how	1
intellectual	1
work	1
dries	1
men	1
up.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
arrived	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
in	1
August,	1
1809.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
youthful	1
Speranski	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
zenith	1
of	1
his	1
fame	1
and	1
his	1
reforms	1
were	1
being	1
pushed	1
forward	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
energy.	1
That	1
same	1
August	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
thrown	1
from	1
his	1
caleche,	1
injured	1
his	1
leg,	1
and	1
remained	1
three	1
weeks	1
at	1
Peterhof,	1
receiving	1
Speranski	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else.	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
two	1
famous	1
decrees	1
were	1
being	1
prepared	1
that	1
so	1
agitated	1
society--abolishing	1
court	1
ranks	1
and	1
introducing	1
examinations	1
to	1
qualify	1
for	1
the	1
grades	1
of	1
Collegiate	1
Assessor	1
and	1
State	1
Councilor--	1
and	1
not	1
merely	1
these	1
but	1
a	1
whole	1
state	1
constitution,	1
intended	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
existing	1
order	1
of	1
government	1
in	1
Russia:	1
legal,	1
administrative,	1
and	1
financial,	1
from	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
State	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
district	1
tribunals.	1
Now	1
those	1
vague	1
liberal	1
dreams	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
had	1
ascended	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
effect	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
his	1
associates,	1
Czartoryski,	1
Novosiltsev,	1
Kochubey,	1
and	1
Strogonov--whom	1
he	1
himself	1
in	1
jest	1
had	1
called	1
his	1
Comite	1
de	1
salut	1
public--were	1
taking	1
shape	1
and	1
being	1
realized.	1
	1
Now	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
Speranski	1
on	1
the	1
civil	1
side,	1
and	1
Arakcheev	1
on	1
the	1
military.	1
Soon	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
chamber,	1
presented	1
himself	1
at	1
court	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
levee.	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
though	1
he	1
met	1
him	1
twice,	1
did	1
not	1
favor	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
word.	1
It	1
had	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
before	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
antipathetic	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
disliked	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
personality	1
generally,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cold,	1
repellent	1
glance	1
the	1
Emperor	1
gave	1
him,	1
he	1
now	1
found	1
further	1
confirmation	1
of	1
this	1
surmise.	1
The	1
courtiers	1
explained	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
neglect	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
His	1
Majesty's	1
displeasure	1
at	1
Bolkonski's	1
not	1
having	1
served	1
since	1
1805.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
myself	1
that	1
one	1
cannot	1
help	1
one's	1
sympathies	1
and	1
antipathies,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"so	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
present	1
my	1
proposal	1
for	1
the	1
reform	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
regulations	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
personally,	1
but	1
the	1
project	1
will	1
speak	1
for	1
itself."	1
	1
He	1
mentioned	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
field	1
marshal,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
father's.	1
The	1
field	1
marshal	1
made	1
an	1
appointment	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
received	1
him	1
graciously,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
inform	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
received	1
notice	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War,	1
Count	1
Arakcheev.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
appointed	1
day	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
Count	1
Arakcheev's	1
waiting	1
room	1
at	1
nine	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
Arakcheev	1
personally,	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
inspired	1
him	1
with	1
but	1
little	1
respect	1
for	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
Minister	1
of	1
War,	1
a	1
man	1
trusted	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
concern	1
myself	1
about	1
his	1
personal	1
qualities:	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
commissioned	1
to	1
consider	1
my	1
project,	1
so	1
he	1
alone	1
can	1
get	1
it	1
adopted,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
as	1
he	1
waited	1
among	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
important	1
and	1
unimportant	1
people	1
in	1
Count	1
Arakcheev's	1
waiting	1
room.	1
	1
During	1
his	1
service,	1
chiefly	1
as	1
an	1
adjutant,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
anterooms	1
of	1
many	1
important	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
different	1
types	1
of	1
such	1
rooms	1
were	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
him.	1
Count	1
Arakcheev's	1
anteroom	1
had	1
quite	1
a	1
special	1
character.	1
The	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
unimportant	1
people	1
awaiting	1
their	1
turn	1
for	1
an	1
audience	1
showed	1
embarrassment	1
and	1
servility;	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
higher	1
rank	1
expressed	1
a	1
common	1
feeling	1
of	1
awkwardness,	1
covered	1
by	1
a	1
mask	1
of	1
unconcern	1
and	1
ridicule	1
of	1
themselves,	1
their	1
situation,	1
and	1
the	1
person	1
for	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
waiting.	1
Some	1
walked	1
thoughtfully	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
others	1
whispered	1
and	1
laughed.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
heard	1
the	1
nickname	1
"Sila	1
Andreevich"	1
and	1
the	1
words,	1
"Uncle	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
us	1
hot,"	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
Count	1
Arakcheev.	1
One	1
general	1
(an	1
important	1
personage),	1
evidently	1
feeling	1
offended	1
at	1
having	1
to	1
wait	1
so	1
long,	1
sat	1
crossing	1
and	1
uncrossing	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
smiling	1
contemptuously	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
one	1
feeling	1
alone	1
appeared	1
on	1
all	1
faces--	1
that	1
of	1
fear.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
asked	1
the	1
adjutant	1
on	1
duty	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
his	1
name,	1
but	1
received	1
an	1
ironical	1
look	1
and	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
his	1
turn	1
would	1
come	1
in	1
due	1
course.	1
After	1
some	1
others	1
had	1
been	1
shown	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
minister's	1
room	1
by	1
the	1
adjutant	1
on	1
duty,	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
struck	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
by	1
his	1
humiliated	1
and	1
frightened	1
air	1
was	1
admitted	1
at	1
that	1
terrible	1
door.	1
This	1
officer's	1
audience	1
lasted	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
the	1
grating	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
harsh	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
officer--with	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
trembling	1
lips--came	1
out	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
waiting	1
room,	1
clutching	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
After	1
this	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
conducted	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
on	1
duty	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
"To	1
the	1
right,	1
at	1
the	1
window."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
a	1
plain	1
tidy	1
room	1
and	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
forty	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
waist,	1
a	1
long	1
closely	1
cropped	1
head,	1
deep	1
wrinkles,	1
scowling	1
brows	1
above	1
dull	1
greenish-hazel	1
eyes	1
and	1
an	1
overhanging	1
red	1
nose.	1
Arakcheev	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
toward	1
him	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
your	1
petition?"	1
asked	1
Arakcheev.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
petitioning,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
returned	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
quietly.	1
	1
Arakcheev's	1
eyes	1
turned	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
"Sit	1
down,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Prince	1
Bolkonski?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
petitioning	1
about	1
anything.	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
has	1
deigned	1
to	1
send	1
your	1
excellency	1
a	1
project	1
submitted	1
by	1
me..."	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
your	1
project,"	1
interrupted	1
Arakcheev,	1
uttering	1
only	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
amiably	1
and	1
then--again	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew--relapsing	1
gradually	1
into	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
grumbling	1
contempt.	1
"You	1
are	1
proposing	1
new	1
military	1
laws?	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
laws	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
old	1
ones.	1
Nowadays	1
everybody	1
designs	1
laws,	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
writing	1
than	1
doing."	1
	1
"I	1
came	1
at	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
wish	1
to	1
learn	1
from	1
your	1
excellency	1
how	1
you	1
propose	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
the	1
memorandum	1
I	1
have	1
presented,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
politely.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
endorsed	1
a	1
resolution	1
on	1
your	1
memorandum	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
committee.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
Arakcheev,	1
rising	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
paper	1
from	1
his	1
writing	1
table.	1
"Here!"	1
and	1
he	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Across	1
the	1
paper	1
was	1
scrawled	1
in	1
pencil,	1
without	1
capital	1
letters,	1
misspelled,	1
and	1
without	1
punctuation:	1
"Unsoundly	1
constructed	1
because	1
resembles	1
an	1
imitation	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
military	1
code	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Articles	1
of	1
War	1
needlessly	1
deviating."	1
	1
"To	1
what	1
committee	1
has	1
the	1
memorandum	1
been	1
referred?"	1
inquired	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
Committee	1
on	1
Army	1
Regulations,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
recommended	1
that	1
your	1
honor	1
should	1
be	1
appointed	1
a	1
member,	1
but	1
without	1
a	1
salary."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
one."	1
	1
"A	1
member	1
without	1
salary,"	1
repeated	1
Arakcheev.	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor...	1
Eh!	1
Call	1
the	1
next	1
one!	1
Who	1
else	1
is	1
there?"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
bowing	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
While	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
announcement	1
of	1
his	1
appointment	1
to	1
the	1
committee	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
up	1
his	1
former	1
acquaintances,	1
particularly	1
those	1
he	1
knew	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
power	1
and	1
whose	1
aid	1
he	1
might	1
need.	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
now	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
a	1
battle,	1
when	1
troubled	1
by	1
anxious	1
curiosity	1
and	1
irresistibly	1
attracted	1
to	1
the	1
ruling	1
circles	1
where	1
the	1
future,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
millions	1
depended,	1
was	1
being	1
shaped.	1
From	1
the	1
irritation	1
of	1
the	1
older	1
men,	1
the	1
curiosity	1
of	1
the	1
uninitiated,	1
the	1
reserve	1
of	1
the	1
initiated,	1
the	1
hurry	1
and	1
preoccupation	1
of	1
everyone,	1
and	1
the	1
innumerable	1
committees	1
and	1
commissions	1
of	1
whose	1
existence	1
he	1
learned	1
every	1
day,	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
now,	1
in	1
1809,	1
here	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
a	1
vast	1
civil	1
conflict	1
was	1
in	1
preparation,	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
mysterious	1
person	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
genius--Speranski.	1
And	1
this	1
movement	1
of	1
reconstruction	1
of	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
a	1
vague	1
idea,	1
and	1
Speranski	1
its	1
chief	1
promoter,	1
began	1
to	1
interest	1
him	1
so	1
keenly	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
regulations	1
quickly	1
receded	1
to	1
a	1
secondary	1
place	1
in	1
his	1
consciousness.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
most	1
favorably	1
placed	1
to	1
secure	1
good	1
reception	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
and	1
most	1
diverse	1
Petersburg	1
circles	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
The	1
reforming	1
party	1
cordially	1
welcomed	1
and	1
courted	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
reputed	1
to	1
be	1
clever	1
and	1
very	1
well	1
read,	1
and	1
secondly	1
because	1
by	1
liberating	1
his	1
serfs	1
he	1
had	1
obtained	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
liberal.	1
The	1
party	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
dissatisfied,	1
who	1
censured	1
the	1
innovations,	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
expecting	1
his	1
sympathy	1
in	1
their	1
disapproval	1
of	1
the	1
reforms,	1
simply	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
father.	1
The	1
feminine	1
society	1
world	1
welcomed	1
him	1
gladly,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
rich,	1
distinguished,	1
a	1
good	1
match,	1
and	1
almost	1
a	1
newcomer,	1
with	1
a	1
halo	1
of	1
romance	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
supposed	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
tragic	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
wife.	1
Besides	1
this	1
the	1
general	1
opinion	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
previously	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
greatly	1
improved	1
during	1
these	1
last	1
five	1
years,	1
having	1
softened	1
and	1
grown	1
more	1
manly,	1
lost	1
his	1
former	1
affectation,	1
pride,	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
irony,	1
and	1
acquired	1
the	1
serenity	1
that	1
comes	1
with	1
years.	1
People	1
talked	1
about	1
him,	1
were	1
interested	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Count	1
Arakcheev,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
Count	1
Kochubey's.	1
He	1
told	1
the	1
count	1
of	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Sila	1
Andreevich	1
(Kochubey	1
spoke	1
of	1
Arakcheev	1
by	1
that	1
nickname	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
vague	1
irony	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
noticed	1
in	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War's	1
anteroom).	1
	1
"Mon	1
cher,	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
you	1
can't	1
do	1
without	1
Michael	1
Mikhaylovich	1
Speranski.	1
He	1
manages	1
everything.	1
I'll	1
speak	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
has	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
this	1
evening."	1
	1
"What	1
has	1
Speranski	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
regulations?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Kochubey	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
smilingly,	1
as	1
if	1
surprised	1
at	1
Bolkonski's	1
simplicity.	1
	1
"We	1
were	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
you	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
ago,"	1
Kochubey	1
continued,	1
"and	1
about	1
your	1
freed	1
plowmen."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
is	1
it	1
you,	1
Prince,	1
who	1
have	1
freed	1
your	1
serfs?"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
day,	1
turning	1
contemptuously	1
toward	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
estate	1
that	1
brought	1
in	1
no	1
profit,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
trying	1
to	1
extenuate	1
his	1
action	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
irritate	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
uselessly.	1
	1
"Afraid	1
of	1
being	1
late..."	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
looking	1
at	1
Kochubey.	1
	1
"There's	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
he	1
continued.	1
"Who	1
will	1
plow	1
the	1
land	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
set	1
free?	1
It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
write	1
laws,	1
but	1
difficult	1
to	1
rule....	1
Just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
now--I	1
ask	1
you,	1
Count--who	1
will	1
be	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
departments	1
when	1
everybody	1
has	1
to	1
pass	1
examinations?"	1
	1
"Those	1
who	1
pass	1
the	1
examinations,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
replied	1
Kochubey,	1
crossing	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
glancing	1
round.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
Pryanichnikov	1
serving	1
under	1
me,	1
a	1
splendid	1
man,	1
a	1
priceless	1
man,	1
but	1
he's	1
sixty.	1
Is	1
he	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
for	1
examination?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
a	1
difficulty,	1
as	1
education	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
general,	1
but..."	1
	1
Count	1
Kochubey	1
did	1
not	1
finish.	1
He	1
rose,	1
took	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
tall,	1
bald,	1
fair	1
man	1
of	1
about	1
forty	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
open	1
forehead	1
and	1
a	1
long	1
face	1
of	1
unusual	1
and	1
peculiar	1
whiteness,	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
entering.	1
The	1
newcomer	1
wore	1
a	1
blue	1
swallow-tail	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
cross	1
suspended	1
from	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
a	1
star	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
breast.	1
It	1
was	1
Speranski.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
recognized	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
throb	1
within	1
him,	1
as	1
happens	1
at	1
critical	1
moments	1
of	1
life.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
respect,	1
envy,	1
or	1
anticipation,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
Speranski's	1
whole	1
figure	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
type	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
easily	1
recognizable.	1
In	1
the	1
society	1
in	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lived	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
anyone	1
who	1
together	1
with	1
awkward	1
and	1
clumsy	1
gestures	1
possessed	1
such	1
calmness	1
and	1
self-assurance;	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
so	1
resolute	1
yet	1
gentle	1
an	1
expression	1
as	1
that	1
in	1
those	1
half-	1
closed,	1
rather	1
humid	1
eyes,	1
or	1
so	1
firm	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
expressed	1
nothing;	1
nor	1
had	1
he	1
heard	1
such	1
a	1
refined,	1
smooth,	1
soft	1
voice;	1
above	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
such	1
delicate	1
whiteness	1
of	1
face	1
or	1
hands--hands	1
which	1
were	1
broad,	1
but	1
very	1
plump,	1
soft,	1
and	1
white.	1
Such	1
whiteness	1
and	1
softness	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
only	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
in	1
hospital.	1
This	1
was	1
Speranski,	1
Secretary	1
of	1
State,	1
reporter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
at	1
Erfurt,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
met	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
Speranski	1
did	1
not	1
shift	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
one	1
face	1
to	1
another	1
as	1
people	1
involuntarily	1
do	1
on	1
entering	1
a	1
large	1
company	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
hurry	1
to	1
speak.	1
He	1
spoke	1
slowly,	1
with	1
assurance	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
listened	1
to,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
person	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
conversing.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
followed	1
Speranski's	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
movement	1
with	1
particular	1
attention.	1
As	1
happens	1
to	1
some	1
people,	1
especially	1
to	1
men	1
who	1
judge	1
those	1
near	1
to	1
them	1
severely,	1
he	1
always	1
on	1
meeting	1
anyone	1
new--	1
especially	1
anyone	1
whom,	1
like	1
Speranski,	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
reputation--expected	1
to	1
discover	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
human	1
qualities.	1
	1
Speranski	1
told	1
Kochubey	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
come	1
sooner	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
detained	1
at	1
the	1
palace.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
kept	1
him,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
noticed	1
this	1
affectation	1
of	1
modesty.	1
When	1
Kochubey	1
introduced	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
Speranski	1
slowly	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
Bolkonski	1
with	1
his	1
customary	1
smile	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
acquaintance.	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
everyone	1
has,"	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
	1
Kochubey	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
about	1
the	1
reception	1
Arakcheev	1
had	1
given	1
Bolkonski.	1
Speranski	1
smiled	1
more	1
markedly.	1
	1
"The	1
chairman	1
of	1
the	1
Committee	1
on	1
Army	1
Regulations	1
is	1
my	1
good	1
friend	1
Monsieur	1
Magnitski,"	1
he	1
said,	1
fully	1
articulating	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
syllable,	1
"and	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
I	1
can	1
put	1
you	1
in	1
touch	1
with	1
him."	1
He	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
full	1
stop.	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
him	1
sympathetic	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
co-	1
operate	1
in	1
promoting	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
reasonable."	1
	1
A	1
circle	1
soon	1
formed	1
round	1
Speranski,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
talked	1
about	1
his	1
subordinate	1
Pryanichnikov	1
addressed	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
without	1
joining	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
watched	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
Speranski's:	1
this	1
man,	1
not	1
long	1
since	1
an	1
insignificant	1
divinity	1
student,	1
who	1
now,	1
Bolkonski	1
thought,	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hands--those	1
plump	1
white	1
hands--the	1
fate	1
of	1
Russia.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
extraordinarily	1
disdainful	1
composure	1
with	1
which	1
Speranski	1
answered	1
the	1
old	1
man.	1
He	1
appeared	1
to	1
address	1
condescending	1
words	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
an	1
immeasurable	1
height.	1
When	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
too	1
loud,	1
Speranski	1
smiled	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
or	1
disadvantage	1
of	1
what	1
pleased	1
the	1
sovereign.	1
	1
Having	1
talked	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
circle,	1
Speranski	1
rose	1
and	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
took	1
him	1
along	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
interest	1
himself	1
in	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
no	1
chance	1
to	1
talk	1
with	1
you,	1
Prince,	1
during	1
the	1
animated	1
conversation	1
in	1
which	1
that	1
venerable	1
gentleman	1
involved	1
me,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
mildly	1
contemptuous	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
intimating	1
by	1
that	1
smile	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
understood	1
the	1
insignificance	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
talking.	1
This	1
flattered	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"I	1
have	1
known	1
of	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time:	1
first	1
from	1
your	1
action	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
your	1
serfs,	1
a	1
first	1
example,	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
desirable	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
more	1
imitators;	1
and	1
secondly	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
chamber	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
considered	1
themselves	1
offended	1
by	1
the	1
new	1
decree	1
concerning	1
the	1
ranks	1
allotted	1
to	1
courtiers,	1
which	1
is	1
causing	1
so	1
much	1
gossip	1
and	1
tittle-tattle."	1
	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"my	1
father	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
privilege.	1
I	1
began	1
the	1
service	1
from	1
the	1
lower	1
grade."	1
	1
"Your	1
father,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
century,	1
evidently	1
stands	1
above	1
our	1
contemporaries	1
who	1
so	1
condemn	1
this	1
measure	1
which	1
merely	1
reestablishes	1
natural	1
justice."	1
	1
"I	1
think,	1
however,	1
that	1
these	1
condemnations	1
have	1
some	1
ground,"	1
returned	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
trying	1
to	1
resist	1
Speranski's	1
influence,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
conscious.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
everything	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
contradict.	1
Though	1
he	1
usually	1
spoke	1
easily	1
and	1
well,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
difficulty	1
in	1
expressing	1
himself	1
now	1
while	1
talking	1
with	1
Speranski.	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
absorbed	1
in	1
observing	1
the	1
famous	1
man's	1
personality.	1
	1
"Grounds	1
of	1
personal	1
ambition	1
maybe,"	1
Speranski	1
put	1
in	1
quietly.	1
	1
"And	1
of	1
state	1
interest	1
to	1
some	1
extent,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Speranski	1
quietly,	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
an	1
admirer	1
of	1
Montesquieu,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"and	1
his	1
idea	1
that	1
le	1
principe	1
des	1
monarchies	1
est	1
l'honneur	1
me	1
parait	1
incontestable.	1
Certains	1
droits	1
et	1
privileges	1
de	1
la	1
noblesse	1
me	1
paraissent	1
etre	1
des	1
moyens	1
de	1
soutenir	1
ce	1
sentiment."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"The	1
principle	1
of	1
monarchies	1
is	1
honor	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
incontestable.	1
Certain	1
rights	1
and	1
privileges	1
for	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
maintaining	1
that	1
sentiment."	1
	1
The	1
smile	1
vanished	1
from	1
Speranski's	1
white	1
face,	1
which	1
was	1
much	1
improved	1
by	1
the	1
change.	1
Probably	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
thought	1
interested	1
him.	1
	1
"Si	1
vous	1
envisagez	1
la	1
question	1
sous	1
ce	1
point	1
de	1
vue,"	1
*	1
he	1
began,	1
pronouncing	1
French	1
with	1
evident	1
difficulty,	1
and	1
speaking	1
even	1
slower	1
than	1
in	1
Russian	1
but	1
quite	1
calmly.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"If	1
you	1
regard	1
the	1
question	1
from	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
view."	1
	1
Speranski	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
honor,	1
l'honneur,	1
cannot	1
be	1
upheld	1
by	1
privileges	1
harmful	1
to	1
the	1
service;	1
that	1
honor,	1
l'honneur,	1
is	1
either	1
a	1
negative	1
concept	1
of	1
not	1
doing	1
what	1
is	1
blameworthy	1
or	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
emulation	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
commendation	1
and	1
rewards,	1
which	1
recognize	1
it.	1
His	1
arguments	1
were	1
concise,	1
simple,	1
and	1
clear.	1
	1
"An	1
institution	1
upholding	1
honor,	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
emulation,	1
is	1
one	1
similar	1
to	1
the	1
Legion	1
d'honneur	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon,	1
not	1
harmful	1
but	1
helpful	1
to	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
service,	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
class	1
or	1
court	1
privilege."	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
dispute	1
that,	1
but	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
denied	1
that	1
court	1
privileges	1
have	1
attained	1
the	1
same	1
end,"	1
returned	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Every	1
courtier	1
considers	1
himself	1
bound	1
to	1
maintain	1
his	1
position	1
worthily."	1
	1
"Yet	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
avail	1
yourself	1
of	1
the	1
privilege,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Speranski,	1
indicating	1
by	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
finish	1
amiably	1
an	1
argument	1
which	1
was	1
embarrassing	1
for	1
his	1
companion.	1
"If	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
calling	1
on	1
me	1
on	1
Wednesday,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"I	1
will,	1
after	1
talking	1
with	1
Magnitski,	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
may	1
interest	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
also	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
detailed	1
chat	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
Closing	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
bowed	1
a	1
la	1
francaise,	1
without	1
taking	1
leave,	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
attract	1
as	1
little	1
attention	1
as	1
possible,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
During	1
the	1
first	1
weeks	1
of	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
the	1
whole	1
trend	1
of	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
formed	1
during	1
his	1
life	1
of	1
seclusion	1
quite	1
overshadowed	1
by	1
the	1
trifling	1
cares	1
that	1
engrossed	1
him	1
in	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
On	1
returning	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
would	1
jot	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
notebook	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
necessary	1
calls	1
or	1
appointments	1
for	1
certain	1
hours.	1
The	1
mechanism	1
of	1
life,	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
everywhere,	1
absorbed	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
vital	1
energy.	1
He	1
did	1
nothing,	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
or	1
find	1
time	1
to	1
think,	1
but	1
only	1
talked,	1
and	1
talked	1
successfully,	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
He	1
sometimes	1
noticed	1
with	1
dissatisfaction	1
that	1
he	1
repeated	1
the	1
same	1
remark	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
in	1
different	1
circles.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
busy	1
for	1
whole	1
days	1
together	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
on	1
their	1
first	1
meeting	1
at	1
Kochubey's,	1
Speranski	1
produced	1
a	1
strong	1
impression	1
on	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
on	1
the	1
Wednesday,	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
him	1
tête-à-tête	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
long	1
and	1
confidentially.	1
	1
To	1
Bolkonski	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
appeared	1
contemptible	1
and	1
insignificant	1
creatures,	1
and	1
he	1
so	1
longed	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
someone	1
the	1
living	1
ideal	1
of	1
that	1
perfection	1
toward	1
which	1
he	1
strove,	1
that	1
he	1
readily	1
believed	1
that	1
in	1
Speranski	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
this	1
ideal	1
of	1
a	1
perfectly	1
rational	1
and	1
virtuous	1
man.	1
Had	1
Speranski	1
sprung	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
class	1
as	1
himself	1
and	1
possessed	1
the	1
same	1
breeding	1
and	1
traditions,	1
Bolkonski	1
would	1
soon	1
have	1
discovered	1
his	1
weak,	1
human,	1
unheroic	1
sides;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
Speranski's	1
strange	1
and	1
logical	1
turn	1
of	1
mind	1
inspired	1
him	1
with	1
respect	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
understand	1
him.	1
Moreover,	1
Speranski,	1
either	1
because	1
he	1
appreciated	1
the	1
other's	1
capacity	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
win	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
side,	1
showed	1
off	1
his	1
dispassionate	1
calm	1
reasonableness	1
before	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
flattered	1
him	1
with	1
that	1
subtle	1
flattery	1
which	1
goes	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
with	1
self-assurance	1
and	1
consists	1
in	1
a	1
tacit	1
assumption	1
that	1
one's	1
companion	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
besides	1
oneself	1
capable	1
of	1
understanding	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
mankind	1
and	1
the	1
reasonableness	1
and	1
profundity	1
of	1
one's	1
own	1
ideas.	1
	1
During	1
their	1
long	1
conversation	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
evening,	1
Speranski	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
remarked:	1
"We	1
regard	1
everything	1
that	1
is	1
above	1
the	1
common	1
level	1
of	1
rooted	1
custom..."	1
or,	1
with	1
a	1
smile:	1
"But	1
we	1
want	1
the	1
wolves	1
to	1
be	1
fed	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
to	1
be	1
safe..."	1
or:	1
"They	1
cannot	1
understand	1
this..."	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"We,	1
you	1
and	1
I,	1
understand	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
who	1
we	1
are."	1
	1
This	1
first	1
long	1
conversation	1
with	1
Speranski	1
only	1
strengthened	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
toward	1
him	1
at	1
their	1
first	1
meeting.	1
He	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
remarkable,	1
clear-thinking	1
man	1
of	1
vast	1
intellect	1
who	1
by	1
his	1
energy	1
and	1
persistence	1
had	1
attained	1
power,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
using	1
solely	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
Russia.	1
In	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
eyes	1
Speranski	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
would	1
himself	1
have	1
wished	1
to	1
be--one	1
who	1
explained	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
life	1
reasonably,	1
considered	1
important	1
only	1
what	1
was	1
rational,	1
and	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
applying	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
reason	1
to	1
everything.	1
Everything	1
seemed	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
clear	1
in	1
Speranski's	1
exposition	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
involuntarily	1
agreed	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
everything.	1
If	1
he	1
replied	1
and	1
argued,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
maintain	1
his	1
independence	1
and	1
not	1
submit	1
to	1
Speranski's	1
opinions	1
entirely.	1
Everything	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be:	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
disconcerted	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
This	1
was	1
Speranski's	1
cold,	1
mirrorlike	1
look,	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
one	1
to	1
penetrate	1
to	1
his	1
soul,	1
and	1
his	1
delicate	1
white	1
hands,	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
involuntarily	1
watched	1
as	1
one	1
does	1
watch	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
possess	1
power.	1
This	1
mirrorlike	1
gaze	1
and	1
those	1
delicate	1
hands	1
irritated	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
why.	1
He	1
was	1
unpleasantly	1
struck,	1
too,	1
by	1
the	1
excessive	1
contempt	1
for	1
others	1
that	1
he	1
observed	1
in	1
Speranski,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
diversity	1
of	1
lines	1
of	1
argument	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
support	1
his	1
opinions.	1
He	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
mental	1
device,	1
except	1
analogy,	1
and	1
passed	1
too	1
boldly,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another.	1
Now	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
practical	1
man	1
and	1
condemn	1
dreamers;	1
now	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
satirist,	1
and	1
laugh	1
ironically	1
at	1
his	1
opponents;	1
now	1
grow	1
severely	1
logical,	1
or	1
suddenly	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
metaphysics.	1
(This	1
last	1
resource	1
was	1
one	1
he	1
very	1
frequently	1
employed.)	1
He	1
would	1
transfer	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
metaphysical	1
heights,	1
pass	1
on	1
to	1
definitions	1
of	1
space,	1
time,	1
and	1
thought,	1
and,	1
having	1
deduced	1
the	1
refutation	1
he	1
needed,	1
would	1
again	1
descend	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
discussion.	1
	1
In	1
general	1
the	1
trait	1
of	1
Speranski's	1
mentality	1
which	1
struck	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
most	1
was	1
his	1
absolute	1
and	1
unshakable	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
of	1
reason.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
thought	1
could	1
never	1
occur	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
seemed	1
so	1
natural,	1
namely,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
after	1
all	1
impossible	1
to	1
express	1
all	1
one	1
thinks;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
the	1
doubt,	1
"Is	1
not	1
all	1
I	1
think	1
and	1
believe	1
nonsense?"	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
this	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
Speranski's	1
mind	1
that	1
particularly	1
attracted	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
first	1
period	1
of	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
Bolkonski	1
felt	1
a	1
passionate	1
admiration	1
for	1
him	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
felt	1
for	1
Bonaparte.	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
Speranski	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
priest,	1
and	1
that	1
stupid	1
people	1
might	1
meanly	1
despise	1
him	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
humble	1
origin	1
(as	1
in	1
fact	1
many	1
did),	1
caused	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
cherish	1
his	1
sentiment	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
more,	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
to	1
strengthen	1
it.	1
	1
On	1
that	1
first	1
evening	1
Bolkonski	1
spent	1
with	1
him,	1
having	1
mentioned	1
the	1
Commission	1
for	1
the	1
Revision	1
of	1
the	1
Code	1
of	1
Laws,	1
Speranski	1
told	1
him	1
sarcastically	1
that	1
the	1
Commission	1
had	1
existed	1
for	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years,	1
had	1
cost	1
millions,	1
and	1
had	1
done	1
nothing	1
except	1
that	1
Rosenkampf	1
had	1
stuck	1
labels	1
on	1
the	1
corresponding	1
paragraphs	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
codes.	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
state	1
has	1
for	1
the	1
millions	1
it	1
has	1
spent,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"We	1
want	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
Senate	1
new	1
juridical	1
powers,	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
laws.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
for	1
men	1
like	1
you,	1
Prince,	1
not	1
to	1
serve	1
in	1
these	1
times!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
said	1
that	1
for	1
that	1
work	1
an	1
education	1
in	1
jurisprudence	1
was	1
needed	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
possess.	1
	1
"But	1
nobody	1
possesses	1
it,	1
so	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
have?	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
vicious	1
circle	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
must	1
break	1
a	1
way	1
out."	1
	1
A	1
week	1
later	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Committee	1
on	1
Army	1
Regulations	1
and--what	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
expected--was	1
chairman	1
of	1
a	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
for	1
the	1
revision	1
of	1
the	1
laws.	1
At	1
Speranski's	1
request	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Civil	1
Code	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
drawn	1
up	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
Code	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
the	1
Institutes	1
of	1
Justinian,	1
he	1
worked	1
at	1
formulating	1
the	1
section	1
on	1
Personal	1
Rights.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Nearly	1
two	1
years	1
before	1
this,	1
in	1
1808,	1
Pierre	1
on	1
returning	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
after	1
visiting	1
his	1
estates	1
had	1
involuntarily	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
leading	1
position	1
among	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
Freemasons.	1
He	1
arranged	1
dining	1
and	1
funeral	1
lodge	1
meetings,	1
enrolled	1
new	1
members,	1
and	1
busied	1
himself	1
uniting	1
various	1
lodges	1
and	1
acquiring	1
authentic	1
charters.	1
He	1
gave	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
erection	1
of	1
temples	1
and	1
supplemented	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
the	1
collection	1
of	1
alms,	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
members	1
were	1
stingy	1
and	1
irregular.	1
He	1
supported	1
almost	1
singlehanded	1
a	1
poorhouse	1
the	1
order	1
had	1
founded	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
His	1
life	1
meanwhile	1
continued	1
as	1
before,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
infatuations	1
and	1
dissipations.	1
He	1
liked	1
to	1
dine	1
and	1
drink	1
well,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
immoral	1
and	1
humiliating	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
the	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
bachelor	1
circles	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
moved.	1
	1
Amid	1
the	1
turmoil	1
of	1
his	1
activities	1
and	1
distractions,	1
however,	1
Pierre	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
firmly	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
rest	1
upon	1
it,	1
the	1
more	1
masonic	1
ground	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
stood	1
gave	1
way	1
under	1
him.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
deeper	1
the	1
ground	1
sank	1
under	1
him	1
the	1
closer	1
bound	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
became	1
to	1
the	1
order.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
joined	1
the	1
Freemasons	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
confidently	1
steps	1
onto	1
the	1
smooth	1
surface	1
of	1
a	1
bog.	1
When	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
foot	1
down	1
it	1
sank	1
in.	1
To	1
make	1
quite	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
other	1
foot	1
down	1
and	1
sank	1
deeper	1
still,	1
became	1
stuck	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
waded	1
knee-deep	1
in	1
the	1
bog.	1
	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
Petersburg--he	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
stood	1
aside	1
from	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
lodges,	1
and	1
lived	1
almost	1
entirely	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
All	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
lodges	1
were	1
men	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
in	1
ordinary	1
life,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
regard	1
them	1
merely	1
as	1
Brothers	1
in	1
Freemasonry	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
Prince	1
B.	1
or	1
Ivan	1
Vasilevich	1
D.,	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
in	1
society	1
mostly	1
as	1
weak	1
and	1
insignificant	1
men.	1
Under	1
the	1
masonic	1
aprons	1
and	1
insignia	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
uniforms	1
and	1
decorations	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
aimed	1
in	1
ordinary	1
life.	1
Often	1
after	1
collecting	1
alms,	1
and	1
reckoning	1
up	1
twenty	1
to	1
thirty	1
rubles	1
received	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
in	1
promises	1
from	1
a	1
dozen	1
members,	1
of	1
whom	1
half	1
were	1
as	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
pay	1
as	1
himself,	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
the	1
masonic	1
vow	1
in	1
which	1
each	1
Brother	1
promised	1
to	1
devote	1
all	1
his	1
belongings	1
to	1
his	1
neighbor,	1
and	1
doubts	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
dwell	1
arose	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
	1
He	1
divided	1
the	1
Brothers	1
he	1
knew	1
into	1
four	1
categories.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
put	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
an	1
active	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
lodges	1
or	1
in	1
human	1
affairs,	1
but	1
were	1
exclusively	1
occupied	1
with	1
the	1
mystical	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
order:	1
with	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
threefold	1
designation	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
three	1
primordial	1
elements--sulphur,	1
mercury,	1
and	1
salt--or	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
square	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
figures	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
Pierre	1
respected	1
this	1
class	1
of	1
Brothers	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
elder	1
ones	1
chiefly	1
belonged,	1
including,	1
Pierre	1
thought,	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
himself,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
share	1
their	1
interests.	1
His	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
mystical	1
aspect	1
of	1
Freemasonry.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
category	1
Pierre	1
reckoned	1
himself	1
and	1
others	1
like	1
him,	1
seeking	1
and	1
vacillating,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
found	1
in	1
Freemasonry	1
a	1
straight	1
and	1
comprehensible	1
path,	1
but	1
hoped	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
category	1
he	1
included	1
those	1
Brothers	1
(the	1
majority)	1
who	1
saw	1
nothing	1
in	1
Freemasonry	1
but	1
the	1
external	1
forms	1
and	1
ceremonies,	1
and	1
prized	1
the	1
strict	1
performance	1
of	1
these	1
forms	1
without	1
troubling	1
about	1
their	1
purport	1
or	1
significance.	1
Such	1
were	1
Willarski	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
lodge.	1
	1
Finally,	1
to	1
the	1
fourth	1
category	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
Brothers	1
belonged,	1
particularly	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
lately	1
joined.	1
These	1
according	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
observations	1
were	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
belief	1
in	1
anything,	1
nor	1
desire	1
for	1
anything,	1
but	1
joined	1
the	1
Freemasons	1
merely	1
to	1
associate	1
with	1
the	1
wealthy	1
young	1
Brothers	1
who	1
were	1
influential	1
through	1
their	1
connections	1
or	1
rank,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
very	1
many	1
in	1
the	1
lodge.	1
	1
Pierre	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing.	1
Freemasonry,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
here,	1
sometimes	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
based	1
merely	1
on	1
externals.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
doubting	1
Freemasonry	1
itself,	1
but	1
suspected	1
that	1
Russian	1
Masonry	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
wrong	1
path	1
and	1
deviated	1
from	1
its	1
original	1
principles.	1
And	1
so	1
toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
he	1
went	1
abroad	1
to	1
be	1
initiated	1
into	1
the	1
higher	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
order.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
1809	1
Pierre	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
Our	1
Freemasons	1
knew	1
from	1
correspondence	1
with	1
those	1
abroad	1
that	1
Bezukhov	1
had	1
obtained	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
many	1
highly	1
placed	1
persons,	1
had	1
been	1
initiated	1
into	1
many	1
mysteries,	1
had	1
been	1
raised	1
to	1
a	1
higher	1
grade,	1
and	1
was	1
bringing	1
back	1
with	1
him	1
much	1
that	1
might	1
conduce	1
to	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
masonic	1
cause	1
in	1
Russia.	1
The	1
Petersburg	1
Freemasons	1
all	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
tried	1
to	1
ingratiate	1
themselves	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
something	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
concealing	1
it.	1
	1
A	1
solemn	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
lodge	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
degree	1
was	1
convened,	1
at	1
which	1
Pierre	1
promised	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
Brothers	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
deliver	1
to	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
highest	1
leaders	1
of	1
their	1
order.	1
The	1
meeting	1
was	1
a	1
full	1
one.	1
After	1
the	1
usual	1
ceremonies	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
and	1
began	1
his	1
address.	1
	1
"Dear	1
Brothers,"	1
he	1
began,	1
blushing	1
and	1
stammering,	1
with	1
a	1
written	1
speech	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
"it	1
is	1
not	1
sufficient	1
to	1
observe	1
our	1
mysteries	1
in	1
the	1
seclusion	1
of	1
our	1
lodge--we	1
must	1
act--act!	1
We	1
are	1
drowsing,	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
act."	1
Pierre	1
raised	1
his	1
notebook	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read.	1
	1
"For	1
the	1
dissemination	1
of	1
pure	1
truth	1
and	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
triumph	1
of	1
virtue,"	1
he	1
read,	1
"we	1
must	1
cleanse	1
men	1
from	1
prejudice,	1
diffuse	1
principles	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
times,	1
undertake	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
the	1
young,	1
unite	1
ourselves	1
in	1
indissoluble	1
bonds	1
with	1
the	1
wisest	1
men,	1
boldly	1
yet	1
prudently	1
overcome	1
superstitions,	1
infidelity,	1
and	1
folly,	1
and	1
form	1
of	1
those	1
devoted	1
to	1
us	1
a	1
body	1
linked	1
together	1
by	1
unity	1
of	1
purpose	1
and	1
possessed	1
of	1
authority	1
and	1
power.	1
	1
"To	1
attain	1
this	1
end	1
we	1
must	1
secure	1
a	1
preponderance	1
of	1
virtue	1
over	1
vice	1
and	1
must	1
endeavor	1
to	1
secure	1
that	1
the	1
honest	1
man	1
may,	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
receive	1
a	1
lasting	1
reward	1
for	1
his	1
virtue.	1
But	1
in	1
these	1
great	1
endeavors	1
we	1
are	1
gravely	1
hampered	1
by	1
the	1
political	1
institutions	1
of	1
today.	1
What	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
these	1
circumstances?	1
To	1
favor	1
revolutions,	1
overthrow	1
everything,	1
repel	1
force	1
by	1
force?...	1
No!	1
We	1
are	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
that.	1
Every	1
violent	1
reform	1
deserves	1
censure,	1
for	1
it	1
quite	1
fails	1
to	1
remedy	1
evil	1
while	1
men	1
remain	1
what	1
they	1
are,	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
wisdom	1
needs	1
no	1
violence.	1
	1
"The	1
whole	1
plan	1
of	1
our	1
order	1
should	1
be	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
preparing	1
men	1
of	1
firmness	1
and	1
virtue	1
bound	1
together	1
by	1
unity	1
of	1
conviction--aiming	1
at	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
vice	1
and	1
folly,	1
and	1
patronizing	1
talent	1
and	1
virtue:	1
raising	1
worthy	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
and	1
attaching	1
them	1
to	1
our	1
Brotherhood.	1
Only	1
then	1
will	1
our	1
order	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
unobtrusively	1
to	1
bind	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
protectors	1
of	1
disorder	1
and	1
to	1
control	1
them	1
without	1
their	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
we	1
must	1
found	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
holding	1
universal	1
sway,	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
diffused	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
without	1
destroying	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
citizenship,	1
and	1
beside	1
which	1
all	1
other	1
governments	1
can	1
continue	1
in	1
their	1
customary	1
course	1
and	1
do	1
everything	1
except	1
what	1
impedes	1
the	1
great	1
aim	1
of	1
our	1
order,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
obtain	1
for	1
virtue	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
vice.	1
This	1
aim	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
Christianity	1
itself.	1
It	1
taught	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
wise	1
and	1
good	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
benefit	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
example	1
and	1
instruction	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
wisest	1
men.	1
	1
"At	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
everything	1
was	1
plunged	1
in	1
darkness,	1
preaching	1
alone	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
sufficient.	1
The	1
novelty	1
of	1
Truth	1
endowed	1
her	1
with	1
special	1
strength,	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
need	1
much	1
more	1
powerful	1
methods.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
necessary	1
that	1
man,	1
governed	1
by	1
his	1
senses,	1
should	1
find	1
in	1
virtue	1
a	1
charm	1
palpable	1
to	1
those	1
senses.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
eradicate	1
the	1
passions;	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
strive	1
to	1
direct	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
noble	1
aim,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
therefore	1
necessary	1
that	1
everyone	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
satisfy	1
his	1
passions	1
within	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
virtue.	1
Our	1
order	1
should	1
provide	1
means	1
to	1
that	1
end.	1
	1
"As	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
worthy	1
men	1
in	1
every	1
state,	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
again	1
training	1
two	1
others	1
and	1
all	1
being	1
closely	1
united,	1
everything	1
will	1
be	1
possible	1
for	1
our	1
order,	1
which	1
has	1
already	1
in	1
secret	1
accomplished	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
mankind."	1
	1
This	1
speech	1
not	1
only	1
made	1
a	1
strong	1
impression,	1
but	1
created	1
excitement	1
in	1
the	1
lodge.	1
The	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
Brothers,	1
seeing	1
in	1
it	1
dangerous	1
designs	1
of	1
Illuminism,	1
*	1
met	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
coldness	1
that	1
surprised	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
Grand	1
Master	1
began	1
answering	1
him,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
began	1
developing	1
his	1
views	1
with	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
warmth.	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
stormy	1
a	1
meeting.	1
Parties	1
were	1
formed,	1
some	1
accusing	1
Pierre	1
of	1
Illuminism,	1
others	1
supporting	1
him.	1
At	1
that	1
meeting	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
endless	1
variety	1
of	1
men's	1
minds,	1
which	1
prevents	1
a	1
truth	1
from	1
ever	1
presenting	1
itself	1
identically	1
to	1
two	1
persons.	1
Even	1
those	1
members	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
understood	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
way	1
with	1
limitations	1
and	1
alterations	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
agree	1
to,	1
as	1
what	1
he	1
always	1
wanted	1
most	1
was	1
to	1
convey	1
his	1
thought	1
to	1
others	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
himself	1
understood	1
it.	1
	1
	1
*	1
The	1
Illuminati	1
sought	1
to	1
substitute	1
republican	1
for	1
monarchical	1
institutions.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master	1
with	1
irony	1
and	1
ill-will	1
reproved	1
Bezukhov	1
for	1
his	1
vehemence	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
love	1
of	1
virtue	1
alone,	1
but	1
also	1
a	1
love	1
of	1
strife	1
that	1
had	1
moved	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
dispute.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
him	1
and	1
asked	1
briefly	1
whether	1
his	1
proposal	1
would	1
be	1
accepted.	1
He	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
usual	1
formalities	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
lodge	1
and	1
went	1
home.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
Again	1
Pierre	1
was	1
overtaken	1
by	1
the	1
depression	1
he	1
so	1
dreaded.	1
For	1
three	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
delivery	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
at	1
the	1
lodge	1
he	1
lay	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
at	1
home	1
receiving	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
going	1
nowhere.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
then	1
that	1
he	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
wife,	1
who	1
implored	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
telling	1
him	1
how	1
grieved	1
she	1
was	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
devote	1
her	1
whole	1
life	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
she	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
from	1
abroad.	1
	1
Following	1
this	1
letter	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
masonic	1
Brothers	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
respected	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
forced	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and,	1
turning	1
the	1
conversation	1
upon	1
Pierre's	1
matrimonial	1
affairs,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
fraternal	1
advice	1
expressed	1
the	1
opinion	1
that	1
his	1
severity	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
neglecting	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
rules	1
of	1
Freemasonry	1
by	1
not	1
forgiving	1
the	1
penitent.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
his	1
mother-in-law,	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
wife,	1
sent	1
to	1
him	1
imploring	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
if	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
to	1
discuss	1
a	1
most	1
important	1
matter.	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
reunite	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mood	1
he	1
then	1
was,	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
him.	1
Nothing	1
mattered	1
to	1
him.	1
Nothing	1
in	1
life	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
much	1
importance,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
depression	1
that	1
possessed	1
him	1
he	1
valued	1
neither	1
his	1
liberty	1
nor	1
his	1
resolution	1
to	1
punish	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
"No	1
one	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
to	1
blame;	1
so	1
she	1
too	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
blame,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
If	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
give	1
his	1
consent	1
to	1
a	1
reunion	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
because	1
in	1
his	1
state	1
of	1
depression	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
step.	1
Had	1
his	1
wife	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
turned	1
her	1
away.	1
Compared	1
to	1
what	1
preoccupied	1
him,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference	1
whether	1
he	1
lived	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
or	1
not?	1
	1
Without	1
replying	1
either	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
or	1
his	1
mother-in-law,	1
Pierre	1
late	1
one	1
night	1
prepared	1
for	1
a	1
journey	1
and	1
started	1
for	1
Moscow	1
to	1
see	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
noted	1
in	1
his	1
diary:	1
	1
Moscow,	1
17th	1
November	1
	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
my	1
benefactor,	1
and	1
hasten	1
to	1
write	1
down	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
experienced.	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
is	1
living	1
poorly	1
and	1
has	1
for	1
three	1
years	1
been	1
suffering	1
from	1
a	1
painful	1
disease	1
of	1
the	1
bladder.	1
No	1
one	1
has	1
ever	1
heard	1
him	1
utter	1
a	1
groan	1
or	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
complaint.	1
From	1
morning	1
till	1
late	1
at	1
night,	1
except	1
when	1
he	1
eats	1
his	1
very	1
plain	1
food,	1
he	1
is	1
working	1
at	1
science.	1
He	1
received	1
me	1
graciously	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
lay.	1
I	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
Knights	1
of	1
the	1
East	1
and	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
he	1
responded	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner,	1
asking	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
mild	1
smile	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
learned	1
and	1
gained	1
in	1
the	1
Prussian	1
and	1
Scottish	1
lodges.	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
as	1
best	1
I	1
could,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
our	1
Petersburg	1
lodge,	1
of	1
the	1
bad	1
reception	1
I	1
had	1
encountered,	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
rupture	1
with	1
the	1
Brothers.	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich,	1
having	1
remained	1
silent	1
and	1
thoughtful	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
while,	1
told	1
me	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
which	1
at	1
once	1
lit	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
my	1
whole	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
future	1
path	1
I	1
should	1
follow.	1
He	1
surprised	1
me	1
by	1
asking	1
whether	1
I	1
remembered	1
the	1
threefold	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
order:	1
(1)	1
The	1
preservation	1
and	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
mystery.	1
(2)	1
The	1
purification	1
and	1
reformation	1
of	1
oneself	1
for	1
its	1
reception,	1
and	1
(3)	1
The	1
improvement	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race	1
by	1
striving	1
for	1
such	1
purification.	1
Which	1
is	1
the	1
principal	1
aim	1
of	1
these	1
three?	1
Certainly	1
self-reformation	1
and	1
self-purification.	1
Only	1
to	1
this	1
aim	1
can	1
we	1
always	1
strive	1
independently	1
of	1
circumstances.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
just	1
this	1
aim	1
demands	1
the	1
greatest	1
efforts	1
of	1
us;	1
and	1
so,	1
led	1
astray	1
by	1
pride,	1
losing	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
aim,	1
we	1
occupy	1
ourselves	1
either	1
with	1
the	1
mystery	1
which	1
in	1
our	1
impurity	1
we	1
are	1
unworthy	1
to	1
receive,	1
or	1
seek	1
the	1
reformation	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race	1
while	1
ourselves	1
setting	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
baseness	1
and	1
profligacy.	1
Illuminism	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
pure	1
doctrine,	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
attracted	1
by	1
social	1
activity	1
and	1
puffed	1
up	1
by	1
pride.	1
On	1
this	1
ground	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
condemned	1
my	1
speech	1
and	1
my	1
whole	1
activity,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
agreed	1
with	1
him.	1
Talking	1
of	1
my	1
family	1
affairs	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
"the	1
chief	1
duty	1
of	1
a	1
true	1
Mason,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you,	1
lies	1
in	1
perfecting	1
himself.	1
We	1
often	1
think	1
that	1
by	1
removing	1
all	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
our	1
life	1
we	1
shall	1
more	1
quickly	1
reach	1
our	1
aim,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
worldly	1
cares	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
attain	1
our	1
three	1
chief	1
aims:	1
(1)	1
Self-knowledge--for	1
man	1
can	1
only	1
know	1
himself	1
by	1
comparison,	1
(2)	1
Self-perfecting,	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
attained	1
by	1
conflict,	1
and	1
(3)	1
The	1
attainment	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
virtue--love	1
of	1
death.	1
Only	1
the	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
life	1
can	1
show	1
us	1
its	1
vanity	1
and	1
develop	1
our	1
innate	1
love	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
of	1
rebirth	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
life."	1
These	1
words	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
remarkable	1
because,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
physical	1
sufferings,	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
is	1
never	1
weary	1
of	1
life	1
though	1
he	1
loves	1
death,	1
for	1
which--in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
purity	1
and	1
loftiness	1
of	1
his	1
inner	1
man--he	1
does	1
not	1
yet	1
feel	1
himself	1
sufficiently	1
prepared.	1
My	1
benefactor	1
then	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
fully	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Square	1
of	1
creation	1
and	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
numbers	1
three	1
and	1
seven	1
are	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
everything.	1
He	1
advised	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
avoid	1
intercourse	1
with	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
Brothers,	1
but	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
only	1
second-grade	1
posts	1
in	1
the	1
lodge,	1
to	1
try,	1
while	1
diverting	1
the	1
Brothers	1
from	1
pride,	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
toward	1
the	1
true	1
path	1
self-	1
knowledge	1
and	1
self-perfecting.	1
Besides	1
this	1
he	1
advised	1
me	1
for	1
myself	1
personally	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
watch	1
over	1
myself,	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
end	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
notebook,	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
writing	1
in	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
in	1
future	1
note	1
down	1
all	1
my	1
actions.	1
	1
Petersburg,	1
23rd	1
November	1
	1
I	1
am	1
again	1
living	1
with	1
my	1
wife.	1
My	1
mother-in-law	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
tears	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
Helene	1
was	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
implored	1
me	1
to	1
hear	1
her;	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
innocent	1
and	1
unhappy	1
at	1
my	1
desertion,	1
and	1
much	1
more.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
once	1
let	1
myself	1
see	1
her	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
strength	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
refusing	1
what	1
she	1
wanted.	1
In	1
my	1
perplexity	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whose	1
aid	1
and	1
advice	1
to	1
seek.	1
Had	1
my	1
benefactor	1
been	1
here	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
reread	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
letters	1
and	1
recalled	1
my	1
conversations	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
deduced	1
from	1
it	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
refuse	1
a	1
supplicant,	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
reach	1
a	1
helping	1
hand	1
to	1
everyone--	1
especially	1
to	1
one	1
so	1
closely	1
bound	1
to	1
me--and	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
bear	1
my	1
cross.	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
forgive	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
doing	1
right,	1
then	1
let	1
union	1
with	1
her	1
have	1
only	1
a	1
spiritual	1
aim.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
decided,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich.	1
I	1
told	1
my	1
wife	1
that	1
I	1
begged	1
her	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
past,	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
whatever	1
wrong	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
done	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
forgive.	1
It	1
gave	1
me	1
joy	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
this.	1
She	1
need	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
again.	1
I	1
have	1
settled	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
floor	1
of	1
this	1
big	1
house	1
and	1
am	1
experiencing	1
a	1
happy	1
feeling	1
of	1
regeneration.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
At	1
that	1
time,	1
as	1
always	1
happens,	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
that	1
met	1
at	1
court	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
grand	1
balls	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
several	1
circles,	1
each	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
particular	1
tone.	1
The	1
largest	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
the	1
French	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
Napoleonic	1
alliance,	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
Count	1
Rumyantsev	1
and	1
Caulaincourt.	1
In	1
this	1
group	1
Helene,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
settled	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
with	1
her	1
husband,	1
took	1
a	1
very	1
prominent	1
place.	1
She	1
was	1
visited	1
by	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
embassy	1
and	1
by	1
many	1
belonging	1
to	1
that	1
circle	1
and	1
noted	1
for	1
their	1
intellect	1
and	1
polished	1
manners.	1
	1
Helene	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Erfurt	1
during	1
the	1
famous	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
Emperors	1
and	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
there	1
these	1
connections	1
with	1
the	1
Napoleonic	1
notabilities.	1
At	1
Erfurt	1
her	1
success	1
had	1
been	1
brilliant.	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
had	1
noticed	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
theater	1
and	1
said	1
of	1
her:	1
"C'est	1
un	1
superbe	1
animal."	1
*	1
Her	1
success	1
as	1
a	1
beautiful	1
and	1
elegant	1
woman	1
did	1
not	1
surprise	1
Pierre,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
even	1
handsomer	1
than	1
before.	1
What	1
did	1
surprise	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
during	1
these	1
last	1
two	1
years	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
gaining	1
the	1
reputation	1
"d'	1
une	1
femme	1
charmante,	1
aussi	1
spirituelle	1
que	1
belle."	1
*(2)	1
The	1
distinguished	1
Prince	1
de	1
Ligne	1
wrote	1
her	1
eight-page	1
letters.	1
Bilibin	1
saved	1
up	1
his	1
epigrams	1
to	1
produce	1
them	1
in	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova's	1
presence.	1
To	1
be	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova's	1
salon	1
was	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
diploma	1
of	1
intellect.	1
Young	1
men	1
read	1
books	1
before	1
attending	1
Helene's	1
evenings,	1
to	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
her	1
salon,	1
and	1
secretaries	1
of	1
the	1
embassy,	1
and	1
even	1
ambassadors,	1
confided	1
diplomatic	1
secrets	1
to	1
her,	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
Helene	1
was	1
a	1
power.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
stupid,	1
sometimes	1
attended,	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
perplexity	1
and	1
fear,	1
her	1
evenings	1
and	1
dinner	1
parties,	1
where	1
politics,	1
poetry,	1
and	1
philosophy	1
were	1
discussed.	1
At	1
these	1
parties	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
conjuror	1
who	1
always	1
expects	1
his	1
trick	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
out	1
at	1
any	1
moment.	1
But	1
whether	1
because	1
stupidity	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
needed	1
to	1
run	1
such	1
a	1
salon,	1
or	1
because	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
deceived	1
found	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
deception,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
remained	1
unexposed	1
and	1
Helene	1
Bezukhova's	1
reputation	1
as	1
a	1
lovely	1
and	1
clever	1
woman	1
became	1
so	1
firmly	1
established	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
the	1
emptiest	1
and	1
stupidest	1
things	1
and	1
everybody	1
would	1
go	1
into	1
raptures	1
over	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
hers	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
profound	1
meaning	1
in	1
it	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
no	1
conception.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"That's	1
a	1
superb	1
animal."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"Of	1
a	1
charming	1
woman,	1
as	1
witty	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
lovely."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
husband	1
needed	1
for	1
a	1
brilliant	1
society	1
woman.	1
He	1
was	1
that	1
absent-minded	1
crank,	1
a	1
grand	1
seigneur	1
husband	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
one's	1
way,	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
spoiling	1
the	1
high	1
tone	1
and	1
general	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
he	1
served,	1
by	1
the	1
contrast	1
he	1
presented	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
an	1
advantageous	1
background	1
to	1
his	1
elegant	1
and	1
tactful	1
wife.	1
Pierre	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
years,	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
his	1
continual	1
absorption	1
in	1
abstract	1
interests	1
and	1
his	1
sincere	1
contempt	1
for	1
all	1
else,	1
had	1
acquired	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
circle,	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him,	1
that	1
air	1
of	1
unconcern,	1
indifference,	1
and	1
benevolence	1
toward	1
all,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
acquired	1
artificially	1
and	1
therefore	1
inspires	1
involuntary	1
respect.	1
He	1
entered	1
his	1
wife's	1
drawing	1
room	1
as	1
one	1
enters	1
a	1
theater,	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
everybody,	1
equally	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
everyone,	1
and	1
equally	1
indifferent	1
to	1
them	1
all.	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
joined	1
in	1
a	1
conversation	1
which	1
interested	1
him	1
and,	1
regardless	1
of	1
whether	1
any	1
"gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
embassy"	1
were	1
present	1
or	1
not,	1
lispingly	1
expressed	1
his	1
views,	1
which	1
were	1
sometimes	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
accepted	1
tone	1
of	1
the	1
moment.	1
But	1
the	1
general	1
opinion	1
concerning	1
the	1
queer	1
husband	1
of	1
"the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
woman	1
in	1
Petersburg"	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
established	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
took	1
his	1
freaks	1
seriously.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
many	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
frequented	1
her	1
house	1
every	1
day,	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
achieved	1
great	1
success	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
Bezukhov	1
household	1
since	1
Helene's	1
return	1
from	1
Erfurt.	1
Helene	1
spoke	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
"mon	1
page"	1
and	1
treated	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
child.	1
Her	1
smile	1
for	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
for	1
everybody,	1
but	1
sometimes	1
that	1
smile	1
made	1
Pierre	1
uncomfortable.	1
Toward	1
him	1
Boris	1
behaved	1
with	1
a	1
particularly	1
dignified	1
and	1
sad	1
deference.	1
This	1
shade	1
of	1
deference	1
also	1
disturbed	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
had	1
suffered	1
so	1
painfully	1
three	1
years	1
before	1
from	1
the	1
mortification	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
subjected	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
protected	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
its	1
repetition,	1
first	1
by	1
not	1
being	1
a	1
husband	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
secondly	1
by	1
not	1
allowing	1
himself	1
to	1
suspect.	1
	1
"No,	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
bluestocking	1
she	1
has	1
finally	1
renounced	1
her	1
former	1
infatuations,"	1
he	1
told	1
himself.	1
"There	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
a	1
bluestocking	1
being	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
heart"--	1
a	1
statement	1
which,	1
though	1
gathered	1
from	1
an	1
unknown	1
source,	1
he	1
believed	1
implicitly.	1
Yet	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
Boris'	1
presence	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
drawing	1
room	1
(and	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
always	1
there)	1
had	1
a	1
physical	1
effect	1
upon	1
Pierre;	1
it	1
constricted	1
his	1
limbs	1
and	1
destroyed	1
the	1
unconsciousness	1
and	1
freedom	1
of	1
his	1
movements.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
strange	1
antipathy,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"yet	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
like	1
him	1
very	1
much."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Pierre	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
gentleman,	1
the	1
rather	1
blind	1
and	1
absurd	1
husband	1
of	1
a	1
distinguished	1
wife,	1
a	1
clever	1
crank	1
who	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
harmed	1
nobody	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
first-rate,	1
good-natured	1
fellow.	1
But	1
a	1
complex	1
and	1
difficult	1
process	1
of	1
internal	1
development	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
soul,	1
revealing	1
much	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
causing	1
him	1
many	1
spiritual	1
doubts	1
and	1
joys.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
diary,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
wrote	1
in	1
it	1
during	1
that	1
time:	1
	1
24th	1
November	1
	1
Got	1
up	1
at	1
eight,	1
read	1
the	1
Scriptures,	1
then	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
duties.	1
(By	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
advice	1
Pierre	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
and	1
served	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
committees.)	1
Returned	1
home	1
for	1
dinner	1
and	1
dined	1
alone--the	1
countess	1
had	1
many	1
visitors	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like.	1
I	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1
moderately	1
and	1
after	1
dinner	1
copied	1
out	1
some	1
passages	1
for	1
the	1
Brothers.	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
told	1
a	1
funny	1
story	1
about	1
B.,	1
and	1
only	1
remembered	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
when	1
everybody	1
laughed	1
loudly	1
at	1
it.	1
	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
bed	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
tranquil	1
mind.	1
Great	1
God,	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
Thy	1
paths,	1
(1)	1
to	1
conquer	1
anger	1
by	1
calmness	1
and	1
deliberation,	1
(2)	1
to	1
vanquish	1
lust	1
by	1
self-restraint	1
and	1
repulsion,	1
(3)	1
to	1
withdraw	1
from	1
worldliness,	1
but	1
not	1
avoid	1
(a)	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
state,	1
(b)	1
family	1
duties,	1
(c)	1
relations	1
with	1
my	1
friends,	1
and	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
my	1
affairs.	1
	1
27th	1
November	1
	1
I	1
got	1
up	1
late.	1
On	1
waking	1
I	1
lay	1
long	1
in	1
bed	1
yielding	1
to	1
sloth.	1
O	1
God,	1
help	1
and	1
strengthen	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
walk	1
in	1
Thy	1
ways!	1
Read	1
the	1
Scriptures,	1
but	1
without	1
proper	1
feeling.	1
Brother	1
Urusov	1
came	1
and	1
we	1
talked	1
about	1
worldly	1
vanities.	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
new	1
projects.	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
criticize	1
them,	1
but	1
remembered	1
my	1
rules	1
and	1
my	1
benefactor's	1
words--that	1
a	1
true	1
Freemason	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
zealous	1
worker	1
for	1
the	1
state	1
when	1
his	1
aid	1
is	1
required	1
and	1
a	1
quiet	1
onlooker	1
when	1
not	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
assist.	1
My	1
tongue	1
is	1
my	1
enemy.	1
Brothers	1
G.	1
V.	1
and	1
O.	1
visited	1
me	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
preliminary	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
Brother.	1
They	1
laid	1
on	1
me	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
Rhetor.	1
I	1
feel	1
myself	1
weak	1
and	1
unworthy.	1
Then	1
our	1
talk	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
pillars	1
and	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
Temple,	1
the	1
seven	1
sciences,	1
the	1
seven	1
virtues,	1
the	1
seven	1
vices,	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
gifts	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit.	1
Brother	1
O.	1
was	1
very	1
eloquent.	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
admission	1
took	1
place.	1
The	1
new	1
decoration	1
of	1
the	1
Premises	1
contributed	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
magnificence	1
of	1
the	1
spectacle.	1
It	1
was	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy	1
who	1
was	1
admitted.	1
I	1
nominated	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
Rhetor.	1
A	1
strange	1
feeling	1
agitated	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
chamber.	1
I	1
caught	1
myself	1
harboring	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
hatred	1
toward	1
him	1
which	1
I	1
vainly	1
tried	1
to	1
overcome.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
should	1
really	1
like	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
evil	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
truth,	1
but	1
evil	1
thoughts	1
of	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
me.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
his	1
object	1
in	1
entering	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
was	1
merely	1
to	1
be	1
intimate	1
and	1
in	1
favor	1
with	1
members	1
of	1
our	1
lodge.	1
Apart	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
me	1
several	1
times	1
whether	1
N.	1
and	1
S.	1
were	1
members	1
of	1
our	1
lodge	1
(a	1
question	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
reply)	1
and	1
that	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
observation	1
he	1
is	1
incapable	1
of	1
feeling	1
respect	1
for	1
our	1
holy	1
order	1
and	1
is	1
too	1
preoccupied	1
and	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
outer	1
man	1
to	1
desire	1
spiritual	1
improvement,	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
doubt	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
insincere,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
stood	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
temple	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
smiling	1
contemptuously	1
at	1
my	1
words,	1
and	1
I	1
wished	1
really	1
to	1
stab	1
his	1
bare	1
breast	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
I	1
held	1
to	1
it.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
eloquent,	1
nor	1
could	1
I	1
frankly	1
mention	1
my	1
doubts	1
to	1
the	1
Brothers	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master.	1
Great	1
Architect	1
of	1
Nature,	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
true	1
path	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
lies!	1
	1
	1
After	1
this,	1
three	1
pages	1
were	1
left	1
blank	1
in	1
the	1
diary,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
following	1
was	1
written:	1
	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
instructive	1
talk	1
alone	1
with	1
Brother	1
V.,	1
who	1
advised	1
me	1
to	1
hold	1
fast	1
by	1
Brother	1
A.	1
Though	1
I	1
am	1
unworthy,	1
much	1
was	1
revealed	1
to	1
me.	1
Adonai	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
creator	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Elohim	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
all.	1
The	1
third	1
name	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
unutterable	1
which	1
means	1
the	1
All.	1
Talks	1
with	1
Brother	1
V.	1
strengthen,	1
refresh,	1
and	1
support	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
virtue.	1
In	1
his	1
presence	1
doubt	1
has	1
no	1
place.	1
The	1
distinction	1
between	1
the	1
poor	1
teachings	1
of	1
mundane	1
science	1
and	1
our	1
sacred	1
all-embracing	1
teaching	1
is	1
clear	1
to	1
me.	1
Human	1
sciences	1
dissect	1
everything	1
to	1
comprehend	1
it,	1
and	1
kill	1
everything	1
to	1
examine	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
holy	1
science	1
of	1
our	1
order	1
all	1
is	1
one,	1
all	1
is	1
known	1
in	1
its	1
entirety	1
and	1
life.	1
The	1
Trinity--the	1
three	1
elements	1
of	1
matter--are	1
sulphur,	1
mercury,	1
and	1
salt.	1
Sulphur	1
is	1
of	1
an	1
oily	1
and	1
fiery	1
nature;	1
in	1
combination	1
with	1
salt	1
by	1
its	1
fiery	1
nature	1
it	1
arouses	1
a	1
desire	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
attracts	1
mercury,	1
seizes	1
it,	1
holds	1
it,	1
and	1
in	1
combination	1
produces	1
other	1
bodies.	1
Mercury	1
is	1
a	1
fluid,	1
volatile,	1
spiritual	1
essence.	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit,	1
Him!...	1
	1
3rd	1
December	1
	1
Awoke	1
late,	1
read	1
the	1
Scriptures	1
but	1
was	1
apathetic.	1
Afterwards	1
went	1
and	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
large	1
hall.	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
meditate,	1
but	1
instead	1
my	1
imagination	1
pictured	1
an	1
occurrence	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
ago,	1
when	1
Dolokhov,	1
meeting	1
me	1
in	1
Moscow	1
after	1
our	1
duel,	1
said	1
he	1
hoped	1
I	1
was	1
enjoying	1
perfect	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
wife's	1
absence.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
answer.	1
Now	1
I	1
recalled	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
that	1
meeting	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
malevolent	1
and	1
bitter	1
replies.	1
I	1
recollected	1
myself	1
and	1
drove	1
away	1
that	1
thought	1
only	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
glowing	1
with	1
anger,	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
repent.	1
Afterwards	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy	1
came	1
and	1
began	1
relating	1
various	1
adventures.	1
His	1
coming	1
vexed	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
I	1
said	1
something	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
replied.	1
I	1
flared	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
much	1
that	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
even	1
rude	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
became	1
silent,	1
and	1
I	1
recollected	1
myself	1
only	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late.	1
My	1
God,	1
I	1
cannot	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
egotism.	1
I	1
set	1
myself	1
above	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
become	1
much	1
worse	1
than	1
he,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
lenient	1
to	1
my	1
rudeness	1
while	1
I	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
nourish	1
contempt	1
for	1
him.	1
O	1
God,	1
grant	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
I	1
may	1
rather	1
see	1
my	1
own	1
vileness,	1
and	1
behave	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
may	1
benefit.	1
After	1
dinner	1
I	1
fell	1
asleep	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
drowsing	1
off	1
I	1
clearly	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
in	1
my	1
left	1
ear,	1
"Thy	1
day!"	1
	1
I	1
dreamed	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
was	1
suddenly	1
surrounded	1
by	1
dogs,	1
but	1
I	1
went	1
on	1
undismayed.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
smallish	1
dog	1
seized	1
my	1
left	1
thigh	1
with	1
its	1
teeth	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
go.	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
throttle	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
hands.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
I	1
torn	1
it	1
off	1
before	1
another,	1
a	1
bigger	1
one,	1
began	1
biting	1
me.	1
I	1
lifted	1
it	1
up,	1
but	1
the	1
higher	1
I	1
lifted	1
it	1
the	1
bigger	1
and	1
heavier	1
it	1
grew.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
Brother	1
A.	1
came	1
and,	1
taking	1
my	1
arm,	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
building	1
to	1
enter	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
pass	1
along	1
a	1
narrow	1
plank.	1
I	1
stepped	1
on	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
bent	1
and	1
gave	1
way	1
and	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
clamber	1
up	1
a	1
fence	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
scarcely	1
reach	1
with	1
my	1
hands.	1
After	1
much	1
effort	1
I	1
dragged	1
myself	1
up,	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
leg	1
hung	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
my	1
body	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
saw	1
Brother	1
A.	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
fence	1
and	1
pointing	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
broad	1
avenue	1
and	1
garden,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
beautiful	1
building.	1
I	1
woke	1
up.	1
O	1
Lord,	1
great	1
Architect	1
of	1
Nature,	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
tear	1
from	1
myself	1
these	1
dogs--my	1
passions	1
especially	1
the	1
last,	1
which	1
unites	1
in	1
itself	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
former	1
ones,	1
and	1
aid	1
me	1
to	1
enter	1
that	1
temple	1
of	1
virtue	1
to	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
attained	1
in	1
my	1
dream.	1
	1
7th	1
December	1
	1
I	1
dreamed	1
that	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
entertain	1
him.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
chattered	1
incessantly	1
with	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
suddenly	1
remembered	1
that	1
this	1
could	1
not	1
please	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
come	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
embrace	1
him.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
drew	1
near	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
had	1
changed	1
and	1
grown	1
young,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
quietly	1
telling	1
me	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
teaching	1
of	1
our	1
order,	1
but	1
so	1
softly	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
it.	1
Then	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
something	1
strange	1
happened.	1
We	1
were	1
sitting	1
or	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
He	1
was	1
telling	1
me	1
something,	1
and	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
my	1
sensibility,	1
and	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
I	1
began	1
picturing	1
to	1
myself	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
my	1
inner	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
sanctifying	1
me.	1
And	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
eyes,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
noticed	1
this.	1
But	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
vexation	1
and	1
jumped	1
up,	1
breaking	1
off	1
his	1
remarks.	1
I	1
felt	1
abashed	1
and	1
asked	1
whether	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
saying	1
did	1
not	1
concern	1
me;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
kind	1
look,	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
suddenly	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
my	1
bedroom	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
double	1
bed.	1
He	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
burned	1
with	1
longing	1
to	1
caress	1
him	1
and	1
lie	1
down	1
too.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
"Tell	1
me	1
frankly	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
chief	1
temptation?	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
it?	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
already."	1
Abashed	1
by	1
this	1
question,	1
I	1
replied	1
that	1
sloth	1
was	1
my	1
chief	1
temptation.	1
He	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
incredulously;	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
abashed,	1
I	1
said	1
that	1
though	1
I	1
was	1
living	1
with	1
my	1
wife	1
as	1
he	1
advised,	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
living	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
her	1
husband.	1
To	1
this	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
one	1
should	1
not	1
deprive	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
one's	1
embraces	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
my	1
duty.	1
But	1
I	1
replied	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
everything	1
vanished.	1
And	1
I	1
awoke	1
and	1
found	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
the	1
text	1
from	1
the	1
Gospel:	1
"The	1
life	1
was	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
men.	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
shineth	1
in	1
darkness;	1
and	1
the	1
darkness	1
comprehended	1
it	1
not."	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
face	1
had	1
looked	1
young	1
and	1
bright.	1
That	1
day	1
I	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
my	1
benefactor	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
about	1
"conjugal	1
duties."	1
	1
9th	1
December	1
	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
dream	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
awoke	1
with	1
a	1
throbbing	1
heart.	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
my	1
house,	1
in	1
the	1
big	1
sitting	1
room,	1
and	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
I	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
regeneration	1
had	1
already	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
rushed	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
I	1
embraced	1
him	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
"Hast	1
thou	1
noticed	1
that	1
my	1
face	1
is	1
different?"	1
I	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
still	1
holding	1
him	1
in	1
my	1
arms,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
young,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
features	1
were	1
quite	1
changed.	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
"I	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
had	1
I	1
met	1
you	1
by	1
chance,"	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
myself,	1
"Am	1
I	1
telling	1
the	1
truth?"	1
And	1
suddenly	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
lying	1
like	1
a	1
dead	1
body;	1
then	1
he	1
gradually	1
recovered	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
me	1
into	1
my	1
study	1
carrying	1
a	1
large	1
book	1
of	1
sheets	1
of	1
drawing	1
paper;	1
I	1
said,	1
"I	1
drew	1
that,"	1
and	1
he	1
answered	1
by	1
bowing	1
his	1
head.	1
I	1
opened	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
pages	1
there	1
were	1
excellent	1
drawings.	1
And	1
in	1
my	1
dream	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
these	1
drawings	1
represented	1
the	1
love	1
adventures	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
with	1
its	1
beloved.	1
And	1
on	1
its	1
pages	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
beautiful	1
representation	1
of	1
a	1
maiden	1
in	1
transparent	1
garments	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
transparent	1
body,	1
flying	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
clouds.	1
And	1
I	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
maiden	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
than	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
Song	1
of	1
Songs.	1
And	1
looking	1
at	1
those	1
drawings	1
I	1
dreamed	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
doing	1
wrong,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
myself	1
away	1
from	1
them.	1
Lord,	1
help	1
me!	1
My	1
God,	1
if	1
Thy	1
forsaking	1
me	1
is	1
Thy	1
doing,	1
Thy	1
will	1
be	1
done;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
the	1
cause,	1
teach	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do!	1
I	1
shall	1
perish	1
of	1
my	1
debauchery	1
if	1
Thou	1
utterly	1
desertest	1
me!	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
The	1
Rostovs'	1
monetary	1
affairs	1
had	1
not	1
improved	1
during	1
the	1
two	1
years	1
they	1
had	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
Though	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
had	1
kept	1
firmly	1
to	1
his	1
resolution	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
serving	1
modestly	1
in	1
an	1
obscure	1
regiment,	1
spending	1
comparatively	1
little,	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
at	1
Otradnoe--Mitenka's	1
management	1
of	1
affairs,	1
in	1
particular--was	1
such	1
that	1
the	1
debts	1
inevitably	1
increased	1
every	1
year.	1
The	1
only	1
resource	1
obviously	1
presenting	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
was	1
to	1
apply	1
for	1
an	1
official	1
post,	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
one	1
and	1
also,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
lassies	1
enjoy	1
themselves	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
their	1
arrival	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Berg	1
proposed	1
to	1
Vera	1
and	1
was	1
accepted.	1
	1
Though	1
in	1
Moscow	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
society	1
without	1
themselves	1
giving	1
it	1
a	1
thought,	1
yet	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
their	1
circle	1
of	1
acquaintances	1
was	1
a	1
mixed	1
and	1
indefinite	1
one.	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
they	1
were	1
provincials,	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
people	1
they	1
had	1
entertained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
without	1
inquiring	1
to	1
what	1
set	1
they	1
belonged,	1
here	1
looked	1
down	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
Rostovs	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hospitable	1
way	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
as	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
diverse	1
people	1
met	1
at	1
their	1
suppers.	1
Country	1
neighbors	1
from	1
Otradnoe,	1
impoverished	1
old	1
squires	1
and	1
their	1
daughters,	1
Peronskaya	1
a	1
maid	1
of	1
honor,	1
Pierre	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
their	1
district	1
postmaster	1
who	1
had	1
obtained	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
Among	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
very	1
soon	1
became	1
frequent	1
visitors	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
were	1
Boris,	1
Pierre	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
dragged	1
home	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
Berg	1
who	1
spent	1
whole	1
days	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
paid	1
the	1
eldest	1
daughter,	1
Countess	1
Vera,	1
the	1
attentions	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
pays	1
when	1
he	1
intends	1
to	1
propose.	1
	1
Not	1
in	1
vain	1
had	1
Berg	1
shown	1
everybody	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
wounded	1
at	1
Austerlitz	1
and	1
held	1
a	1
perfectly	1
unnecessary	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
left.	1
He	1
narrated	1
that	1
episode	1
so	1
persistently	1
and	1
with	1
so	1
important	1
an	1
air	1
that	1
everyone	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
merit	1
and	1
usefulness	1
of	1
his	1
deed,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
obtained	1
two	1
decorations	1
for	1
Austerlitz.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
Finnish	1
war	1
he	1
also	1
managed	1
to	1
distinguish	1
himself.	1
He	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
scrap	1
of	1
a	1
grenade	1
that	1
had	1
killed	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
standing	1
near	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
commander.	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
after	1
Austerlitz,	1
he	1
related	1
this	1
occurrence	1
at	1
such	1
length	1
and	1
so	1
insistently	1
that	1
everyone	1
again	1
believed	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
necessary	1
to	1
do	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
received	1
two	1
decorations	1
for	1
the	1
Finnish	1
war	1
also.	1
In	1
1809	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
captain	1
in	1
the	1
Guards,	1
wore	1
medals,	1
and	1
held	1
some	1
special	1
lucrative	1
posts	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
Though	1
some	1
skeptics	1
smiled	1
when	1
told	1
of	1
Berg's	1
merits,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
denied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
painstaking	1
and	1
brave	1
officer,	1
on	1
excellent	1
terms	1
with	1
his	1
superiors,	1
and	1
a	1
moral	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
brilliant	1
career	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
an	1
assured	1
position	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
Four	1
years	1
before,	1
meeting	1
a	1
German	1
comrade	1
in	1
the	1
stalls	1
of	1
a	1
Moscow	1
theater,	1
Berg	1
had	1
pointed	1
out	1
Vera	1
Rostova	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
said	1
in	1
German,	1
"das	1
soll	1
mein	1
Weib	1
werden,"	1
*	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
marry	1
her.	1
Now	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
having	1
considered	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
position	1
and	1
his	1
own,	1
he	1
decided	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
propose.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"That	1
girl	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
wife."	1
	1
Berg's	1
proposal	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
received	1
with	1
a	1
perplexity	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
flattering	1
to	1
him.	1
At	1
first	1
it	1
seemed	1
strange	1
that	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
an	1
obscure	1
Livonian	1
gentleman	1
should	1
propose	1
marriage	1
to	1
a	1
Countess	1
Rostova;	1
but	1
Berg's	1
chief	1
characteristic	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
naive	1
and	1
good	1
natured	1
egotism	1
that	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
involuntarily	1
came	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
since	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
so	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good,	1
indeed	1
excellent.	1
Moreover,	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
affairs	1
were	1
seriously	1
embarrassed,	1
as	1
the	1
suitor	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
know;	1
and	1
above	1
all,	1
Vera	1
was	1
twenty-four,	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
out	1
everywhere,	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
certainly	1
good-looking	1
and	1
sensible,	1
no	1
one	1
up	1
to	1
now	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
her.	1
So	1
they	1
gave	1
their	1
consent.	1
	1
"You	1
see,"	1
said	1
Berg	1
to	1
his	1
comrade,	1
whom	1
he	1
called	1
"friend"	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
everyone	1
has	1
friends,	1
"you	1
see,	1
I	1
have	1
considered	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
should	1
not	1
marry	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
or	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
unsuitable.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
my	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma	1
are	1
now	1
provided	1
for--I	1
have	1
arranged	1
that	1
rent	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
Baltic	1
Provinces--and	1
I	1
can	1
live	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
my	1
pay,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
fortune	1
and	1
my	1
good	1
management	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
along	1
nicely.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
marrying	1
for	1
money--I	1
consider	1
that	1
dishonorable--but	1
a	1
wife	1
should	1
bring	1
her	1
share	1
and	1
a	1
husband	1
his.	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
she	1
has	1
connections	1
and	1
some	1
means.	1
In	1
our	1
times	1
that	1
is	1
worth	1
something,	1
isn't	1
it?	1
But	1
above	1
all,	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
handsome,	1
estimable	1
girl,	1
and	1
she	1
loves	1
me..."	1
	1
Berg	1
blushed	1
and	1
smiled.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
love	1
her,	1
because	1
her	1
character	1
is	1
sensible	1
and	1
very	1
good.	1
Now	1
the	1
other	1
sister,	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
family,	1
is	1
quite	1
different--	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
character	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
intelligence.	1
She	1
is	1
so...	1
you	1
know?...	1
Unpleasant...	1
But	1
my	1
fiancee!...	1
Well,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
coming,"	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say,	1
"to	1
dine,"	1
but	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
said	1
"to	1
take	1
tea	1
with	1
us,"	1
and	1
quickly	1
doubling	1
up	1
his	1
tongue	1
he	1
blew	1
a	1
small	1
round	1
ring	1
of	1
tobacco	1
smoke,	1
perfectly	1
embodying	1
his	1
dream	1
of	1
happiness.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
first	1
feeling	1
of	1
perplexity	1
aroused	1
in	1
the	1
parents	1
by	1
Berg's	1
proposal,	1
the	1
holiday	1
tone	1
of	1
joyousness	1
usual	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
but	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
was	1
external	1
and	1
insincere.	1
In	1
the	1
family's	1
feeling	1
toward	1
this	1
wedding	1
a	1
certain	1
awkwardness	1
and	1
constraint	1
was	1
evident,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
ashamed	1
of	1
not	1
having	1
loved	1
Vera	1
sufficiently	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
off	1
their	1
hands.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
felt	1
this	1
most.	1
He	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
state	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
embarrassment,	1
but	1
it	1
resulted	1
from	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
affairs.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
at	1
all	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
had,	1
what	1
his	1
debts	1
amounted	1
to,	1
or	1
what	1
dowry	1
he	1
could	1
give	1
Vera.	1
When	1
his	1
daughters	1
were	1
born	1
he	1
had	1
assigned	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
them,	1
for	1
her	1
dowry,	1
an	1
estate	1
with	1
three	1
hundred	1
serfs;	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
estates	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
sold,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
mortgaged	1
and	1
the	1
interest	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
arrears	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
sold,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
Vera.	1
Nor	1
had	1
he	1
any	1
money.	1
	1
Berg	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
engaged	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
only	1
a	1
week	1
remained	1
before	1
the	1
wedding,	1
but	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
decided	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
dowry,	1
nor	1
spoken	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
about	1
it.	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
the	1
count	1
thought	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
estate	1
or	1
of	1
selling	1
a	1
forest,	1
at	1
another	1
time	1
of	1
borrowing	1
money	1
on	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
hand.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
wedding	1
Berg	1
entered	1
the	1
count's	1
study	1
early	1
one	1
morning	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile,	1
respectfully	1
asked	1
his	1
future	1
father-in-law	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
what	1
Vera's	1
dowry	1
would	1
be.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
so	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
this	1
long-foreseen	1
inquiry	1
that	1
without	1
consideration	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
first	1
reply	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
like	1
your	1
being	1
businesslike	1
about	1
it....	1
I	1
like	1
it.	1
You	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied...."	1
	1
And	1
patting	1
Berg	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
he	1
got	1
up,	1
wishing	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
conversation.	1
But	1
Berg,	1
smiling	1
pleasantly,	1
explained	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
how	1
much	1
Vera	1
would	1
have	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
receive	1
at	1
least	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
dowry	1
in	1
advance,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
break	1
matters	1
off.	1
	1
"Because,	1
consider,	1
Count--if	1
I	1
allowed	1
myself	1
to	1
marry	1
now	1
without	1
having	1
definite	1
means	1
to	1
maintain	1
my	1
wife,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
acting	1
badly...."	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
ended	1
by	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
generous	1
and	1
to	1
avoid	1
further	1
importunity,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
hand	1
for	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
rubles.	1
Berg	1
smiled	1
meekly,	1
kissed	1
the	1
count	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
grateful,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
arrange	1
his	1
new	1
life	1
without	1
receiving	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
in	1
ready	1
money.	1
"Or	1
at	1
least	1
twenty	1
thousand,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"and	1
then	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
hand	1
for	1
only	1
sixty	1
thousand."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
all	1
right!"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
hurriedly.	1
"Only	1
excuse	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I'll	1
give	1
you	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
and	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
hand	1
for	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
as	1
well.	1
Yes,	1
yes!	1
Kiss	1
me."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sixteen	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
year	1
1809,	1
the	1
very	1
year	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
counted	1
on	1
her	1
fingers	1
with	1
Boris	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
kissed	1
four	1
years	1
ago.	1
Since	1
then	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him.	1
Before	1
Sonya	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
if	1
Boris	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned,	1
she	1
spoke	1
quite	1
freely	1
of	1
that	1
episode	1
as	1
of	1
some	1
childish,	1
long-forgotten	1
matter	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
worth	1
mentioning.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
depths	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
her	1
engagement	1
to	1
Boris	1
was	1
a	1
jest	1
or	1
an	1
important,	1
binding	1
promise	1
tormented	1
her.	1
	1
Since	1
Boris	1
left	1
Moscow	1
in	1
1805	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Moscow	1
several	1
times,	1
and	1
had	1
passed	1
near	1
Otradnoe,	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
Natasha	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
and	1
this	1
conjecture	1
was	1
confirmed	1
by	1
the	1
sad	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
elders	1
spoke	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Nowadays	1
old	1
friends	1
are	1
not	1
remembered,"	1
the	1
countess	1
would	1
say	1
when	1
Boris	1
was	1
mentioned.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
also	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
visited	1
them	1
less	1
frequently,	1
seemed	1
to	1
hold	1
herself	1
with	1
particular	1
dignity,	1
and	1
always	1
spoke	1
rapturously	1
and	1
gratefully	1
of	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
brilliant	1
career	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
entered.	1
When	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
came	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
Boris	1
called	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
drove	1
to	1
their	1
house	1
in	1
some	1
agitation.	1
The	1
memory	1
of	1
Natasha	1
was	1
his	1
most	1
poetic	1
recollection.	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
firm	1
intention	1
of	1
letting	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
parents	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
childish	1
relations	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
Natasha	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
binding	1
either	1
on	1
her	1
or	1
on	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
brilliant	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
intimacy	1
with	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova,	1
a	1
brilliant	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
patronage	1
of	1
an	1
important	1
personage	1
whose	1
complete	1
confidence	1
he	1
enjoyed,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
make	1
plans	1
for	1
marrying	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
richest	1
heiresses	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
plans	1
which	1
might	1
very	1
easily	1
be	1
realized.	1
When	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
drawing	1
room	1
Natasha	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room.	1
When	1
she	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
she	1
almost	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
flushed	1
and	1
beaming	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
cordial	1
smile.	1
	1
Boris	1
remembered	1
Natasha	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
dress,	1
with	1
dark	1
eyes	1
shining	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
curls	1
and	1
boisterous,	1
childish	1
laughter,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
four	1
years	1
before;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
aback	1
when	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
Natasha	1
entered,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
expressed	1
rapturous	1
astonishment.	1
This	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
pleased	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Well,	1
do	1
you	1
recognize	1
your	1
little	1
madcap	1
playmate?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
Boris	1
kissed	1
Natasha's	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
"How	1
handsome	1
you	1
have	1
grown!"	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
think	1
so!"	1
replied	1
Natasha's	1
laughing	1
eyes.	1
	1
"And	1
is	1
Papa	1
older?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
down	1
and,	1
without	1
joining	1
in	1
Boris'	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
countess,	1
silently	1
and	1
minutely	1
studied	1
her	1
childhood's	1
suitor.	1
He	1
felt	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
that	1
resolute	1
and	1
affectionate	1
scrutiny	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
occasionally.	1
	1
Boris'	1
uniform,	1
spurs,	1
tie,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
brushed	1
were	1
all	1
comme	1
il	1
faut	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion.	1
This	1
Natasha	1
noticed	1
at	1
once.	1
He	1
sat	1
rather	1
sideways	1
in	1
the	1
armchair	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
countess,	1
arranging	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
the	1
cleanest	1
of	1
gloves	1
that	1
fitted	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
like	1
a	1
skin,	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
a	1
particularly	1
refined	1
compression	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
about	1
the	1
amusements	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
Petersburg	1
society,	1
recalling	1
with	1
mild	1
irony	1
old	1
times	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
Moscow	1
acquaintances.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
accidentally,	1
Natasha	1
felt,	1
that	1
he	1
alluded,	1
when	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
aristocracy,	1
to	1
an	1
ambassador's	1
ball	1
he	1
had	1
attended,	1
and	1
to	1
invitations	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
N.N.	1
and	1
S.S.	1
	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
silent,	1
glancing	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows.	1
This	1
gaze	1
disturbed	1
and	1
confused	1
Boris	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
He	1
looked	1
round	1
more	1
frequently	1
toward	1
her,	1
and	1
broke	1
off	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
minutes,	1
then	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
leave.	1
The	1
same	1
inquisitive,	1
challenging,	1
and	1
rather	1
mocking	1
eyes	1
still	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
After	1
his	1
first	1
visit	1
Boris	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
Natasha	1
attracted	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
ever,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
yield	1
to	1
that	1
feeling,	1
because	1
to	1
marry	1
her,	1
a	1
girl	1
almost	1
without	1
fortune,	1
would	1
mean	1
ruin	1
to	1
his	1
career,	1
while	1
to	1
renew	1
their	1
former	1
relations	1
without	1
intending	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
would	1
be	1
dishonorable.	1
Boris	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
despite	1
that	1
resolution	1
he	1
called	1
again	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
and	1
began	1
calling	1
often	1
and	1
spending	1
whole	1
days	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
explanation	1
with	1
Natasha	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
times	1
must	1
be	1
forgotten,	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
everything...	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
his	1
wife,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
means,	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
let	1
her	1
marry	1
him.	1
But	1
he	1
failed	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
felt	1
awkward	1
about	1
entering	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
explanation.	1
From	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
entangled.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Sonya	1
that	1
Natasha	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Boris	1
as	1
of	1
old.	1
She	1
sang	1
him	1
his	1
favorite	1
songs,	1
showed	1
him	1
her	1
album,	1
making	1
him	1
write	1
in	1
it,	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
allude	1
to	1
the	1
past,	1
letting	1
it	1
be	1
understood	1
how	1
delightful	1
was	1
the	1
present;	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
fog,	1
without	1
having	1
said	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to,	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
or	1
why	1
he	1
came,	1
or	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
end.	1
He	1
left	1
off	1
visiting	1
Helene	1
and	1
received	1
reproachful	1
notes	1
from	1
her	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
spend	1
whole	1
days	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
One	1
night	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
countess,	1
in	1
nightcap	1
and	1
dressing	1
jacket,	1
without	1
her	1
false	1
curls,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
poor	1
little	1
knob	1
of	1
hair	1
showing	1
under	1
her	1
white	1
cotton	1
cap,	1
knelt	1
sighing	1
and	1
groaning	1
on	1
a	1
rug	1
and	1
bowing	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
prayer,	1
her	1
door	1
creaked	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
with	1
slippers	1
on	1
her	1
bare	1
feet	1
and	1
her	1
hair	1
in	1
curlpapers,	1
ran	1
in.	1
The	1
countess--her	1
prayerful	1
mood	1
dispelled--looked	1
round	1
and	1
frowned.	1
She	1
was	1
finishing	1
her	1
last	1
prayer:	1
"Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
this	1
couch	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
grave?"	1
Natasha,	1
flushed	1
and	1
eager,	1
seeing	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
prayer,	1
suddenly	1
checked	1
her	1
rush,	1
half	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
put	1
out	1
her	1
tongue	1
as	1
if	1
chiding	1
herself.	1
Seeing	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
still	1
praying	1
she	1
ran	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
and,	1
rapidly	1
slipping	1
one	1
little	1
foot	1
against	1
the	1
other,	1
pushed	1
off	1
her	1
slippers	1
and	1
jumped	1
onto	1
the	1
bed	1
the	1
countess	1
had	1
feared	1
might	1
become	1
her	1
grave.	1
This	1
couch	1
was	1
high,	1
with	1
a	1
feather	1
bed	1
and	1
five	1
pillows	1
each	1
smaller	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
below.	1
Natasha	1
jumped	1
on	1
it,	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
feather	1
bed,	1
rolled	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
began	1
snuggling	1
up	1
the	1
bedclothes	1
as	1
she	1
settled	1
down,	1
raising	1
her	1
knees	1
to	1
her	1
chin,	1
kicking	1
out	1
and	1
laughing	1
almost	1
inaudibly,	1
now	1
covering	1
herself	1
up	1
head	1
and	1
all,	1
and	1
now	1
peeping	1
at	1
her	1
mother.	1
The	1
countess	1
finished	1
her	1
prayers	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
face,	1
but	1
seeing,	1
that	1
Natasha's	1
head	1
was	1
covered,	1
she	1
smiled	1
in	1
her	1
kind,	1
weak	1
way.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
now	1
then!"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
can	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
talk?	1
Yes?"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Now,	1
just	1
one	1
on	1
your	1
throat	1
and	1
another...	1
that'll	1
do!"	1
And	1
seizing	1
her	1
mother	1
round	1
the	1
neck,	1
she	1
kissed	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
throat.	1
In	1
her	1
behavior	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
Natasha	1
seemed	1
rough,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
sensitive	1
and	1
tactful	1
that	1
however	1
she	1
clasped	1
her	1
mother	1
she	1
always	1
managed	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
without	1
hurting	1
her	1
or	1
making	1
her	1
feel	1
uncomfortable	1
or	1
displeased.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
tonight?"	1
said	1
the	1
mother,	1
having	1
arranged	1
her	1
pillows	1
and	1
waited	1
until	1
Natasha,	1
after	1
turning	1
over	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
times,	1
had	1
settled	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
under	1
the	1
quilt,	1
spread	1
out	1
her	1
arms,	1
and	1
assumed	1
a	1
serious	1
expression.	1
	1
These	1
visits	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
at	1
night	1
before	1
the	1
count	1
returned	1
from	1
his	1
club	1
were	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasures	1
of	1
both	1
mother,	1
and	1
daughter.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
tonight?--But	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you..."	1
	1
Natasha	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
mother's	1
mouth.	1
	1
"About	1
Boris...	1
I	1
know,"	1
she	1
said	1
seriously;	1
"that's	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
about.	1
Don't	1
say	1
it--I	1
know.	1
No,	1
do	1
tell	1
me!"	1
and	1
she	1
removed	1
her	1
hand.	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
Mamma!	1
He's	1
nice?"	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
you	1
are	1
sixteen.	1
At	1
your	1
age	1
I	1
was	1
married.	1
You	1
say	1
Boris	1
is	1
nice.	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
nice,	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
son.	1
But	1
what	1
then?...	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
about?	1
You	1
have	1
quite	1
turned	1
his	1
head,	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
that...."	1
	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
the	1
countess	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
daughter.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
lying	1
looking	1
steadily	1
straight	1
before	1
her	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mahogany	1
sphinxes	1
carved	1
on	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
bedstead,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
countess	1
only	1
saw	1
her	1
daughter's	1
face	1
in	1
profile.	1
That	1
face	1
struck	1
her	1
by	1
its	1
peculiarly	1
serious	1
and	1
concentrated	1
expression.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
listening	1
and	1
considering.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
then?"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
quite	1
turned	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
why?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
him?	1
You	1
know	1
you	1
can't	1
marry	1
him."	1
	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
without	1
changing	1
her	1
position.	1
	1
"Because	1
he	1
is	1
young,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
poor,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
relation...	1
and	1
because	1
you	1
yourself	1
don't	1
love	1
him."	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know?"	1
	1
"I	1
know.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
right,	1
darling!"	1
	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
I	1
want	1
to..."	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Leave	1
off	1
talking	1
nonsense,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
I	1
want	1
to..."	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
earnest..."	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
finish.	1
She	1
drew	1
the	1
countess'	1
large	1
hand	1
to	1
her,	1
kissed	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
and	1
then	1
on	1
the	1
palm,	1
then	1
again	1
turned	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
began	1
kissing	1
first	1
one	1
knuckle,	1
then	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
knuckles,	1
then	1
the	1
next	1
knuckle,	1
whispering,	1
"January,	1
February,	1
March,	1
April,	1
May.	1
Speak,	1
Mamma,	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
say	1
anything?	1
Speak!"	1
said	1
she,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
who	1
was	1
tenderly	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
contemplation	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
wished	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"It	1
won't	1
do,	1
my	1
love!	1
Not	1
everyone	1
will	1
understand	1
this	1
friendship	1
dating	1
from	1
your	1
childish	1
days,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
so	1
intimate	1
with	1
you	1
may	1
injure	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
other	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
visit	1
us,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
it	1
torments	1
him	1
for	1
nothing.	1
He	1
may	1
already	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
suitable	1
and	1
wealthy	1
match,	1
and	1
now	1
he's	1
half	1
crazy."	1
	1
"Crazy?"	1
repeated	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
some	1
things	1
about	1
myself.	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
cousin..."	1
	1
"I	1
know!	1
Cyril	1
Matveich...	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
old."	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
old.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I'll	1
do,	1
Natasha,	1
I'll	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
Boris.	1
He	1
need	1
not	1
come	1
so	1
often...."	1
	1
"Why	1
not,	1
if	1
he	1
likes	1
to?"	1
	1
"Because	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
nothing...."	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
know?	1
No,	1
Mamma,	1
don't	1
speak	1
to	1
him!	1
What	1
nonsense!"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
one	1
being	1
deprived	1
of	1
her	1
property.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
won't	1
marry,	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
if	1
he	1
enjoys	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
enjoy	1
it."	1
Natasha	1
smiled	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
mother.	1
"Not	1
to	1
marry,	1
but	1
just	1
so,"	1
she	1
added.	1
	1
"How	1
so,	1
my	1
pet?"	1
	1
"Just	1
so.	1
There's	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
marry	1
him.	1
But...	1
just	1
so."	1
	1
"Just	1
so,	1
just	1
so,"	1
repeated	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
shaking	1
all	1
over,	1
she	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
a	1
good	1
humored,	1
unexpected,	1
elderly	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Don't	1
laugh,	1
stop!"	1
cried	1
Natasha.	1
"You're	1
shaking	1
the	1
whole	1
bed!	1
You're	1
awfully	1
like	1
me,	1
just	1
such	1
another	1
giggler....	1
Wait..."	1
and	1
she	1
seized	1
the	1
countess'	1
hands	1
and	1
kissed	1
a	1
knuckle	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
finger,	1
saying,	1
"June,"	1
and	1
continued,	1
kissing,	1
"July,	1
August,"	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand.	1
"But,	1
Mamma,	1
is	1
he	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
Was	1
anybody	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you?	1
And	1
he's	1
very	1
nice,	1
very,	1
very	1
nice.	1
Only	1
not	1
quite	1
my	1
taste--he	1
is	1
so	1
narrow,	1
like	1
the	1
dining-room	1
clock....	1
Don't	1
you	1
understand?	1
Narrow,	1
you	1
know--gray,	1
light	1
gray..."	1
	1
"What	1
rubbish	1
you're	1
talking!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
Natasha	1
continued:	1
"Don't	1
you	1
really	1
understand?	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
understand....	1
Bezukhov,	1
now,	1
is	1
blue,	1
dark-blue	1
and	1
red,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
square."	1
	1
"You	1
flirt	1
with	1
him	1
too,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
laughing.	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Freemason,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
out.	1
He	1
is	1
fine,	1
dark-blue	1
and	1
red....	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
you?"	1
	1
"Little	1
countess!"	1
the	1
count's	1
voice	1
called	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
door.	1
"You're	1
not	1
asleep?"	1
Natasha	1
jumped	1
up,	1
snatched	1
up	1
her	1
slippers,	1
and	1
ran	1
barefoot	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
sleep.	1
She	1
kept	1
thinking	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
understand	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
and	1
all	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
"Sonya?"	1
she	1
thought,	1
glancing	1
at	1
that	1
curled-up,	1
sleeping	1
little	1
kitten	1
with	1
her	1
enormous	1
plait	1
of	1
hair.	1
"No,	1
how	1
could	1
she?	1
She's	1
virtuous.	1
She	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
more.	1
Even	1
Mamma	1
does	1
not	1
understand.	1
It	1
is	1
wonderful	1
how	1
clever	1
I	1
am	1
and	1
how...	1
charming	1
she	1
is,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
speaking	1
of	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
person,	1
and	1
imagining	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
very	1
wise	1
man--the	1
wisest	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
men--who	1
was	1
saying	1
it	1
of	1
her.	1
"There	1
is	1
everything,	1
everything	1
in	1
her,"	1
continued	1
this	1
man.	1
"She	1
is	1
unusually	1
intelligent,	1
charming...	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
is	1
pretty,	1
uncommonly	1
pretty,	1
and	1
agile--she	1
swims	1
and	1
rides	1
splendidly...	1
and	1
her	1
voice!	1
One	1
can	1
really	1
say	1
it's	1
a	1
wonderful	1
voice!"	1
	1
She	1
hummed	1
a	1
scrap	1
from	1
her	1
favorite	1
opera	1
by	1
Cherubini,	1
threw	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
bed,	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
pleasant	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
immediately	1
fall	1
asleep,	1
called	1
Dunyasha	1
the	1
maid	1
to	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
candle,	1
and	1
before	1
Dunyasha	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
already	1
passed	1
into	1
yet	1
another	1
happier	1
world	1
of	1
dreams,	1
where	1
everything	1
was	1
as	1
light	1
and	1
beautiful	1
as	1
in	1
reality,	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
so	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
different.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
countess	1
called	1
Boris	1
aside	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
him,	1
after	1
which	1
he	1
ceased	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
On	1
the	1
thirty-first	1
of	1
December,	1
New	1
Year's	1
Eve,	1
1809	1
-	1
10	1
an	1
old	1
grandee	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
day	1
was	1
giving	1
a	1
ball	1
and	1
midnight	1
supper.	1
The	1
diplomatic	1
corps	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
present.	1
	1
The	1
grandee's	1
well-known	1
mansion	1
on	1
the	1
English	1
Quay	1
glittered	1
with	1
innumerable	1
lights.	1
Police	1
were	1
stationed	1
at	1
the	1
brightly	1
lit	1
entrance	1
which	1
was	1
carpeted	1
with	1
red	1
baize,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
gendarmes	1
but	1
dozens	1
of	1
police	1
officers	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
police	1
master	1
himself	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
porch.	1
Carriages	1
kept	1
driving	1
away	1
and	1
fresh	1
ones	1
arriving,	1
with	1
red-liveried	1
footmen	1
and	1
footmen	1
in	1
plumed	1
hats.	1
From	1
the	1
carriages	1
emerged	1
men	1
wearing	1
uniforms,	1
stars,	1
and	1
ribbons,	1
while	1
ladies	1
in	1
satin	1
and	1
ermine	1
cautiously	1
descended	1
the	1
carriage	1
steps	1
which	1
were	1
let	1
down	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
clatter,	1
and	1
then	1
walked	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
noiselessly	1
over	1
the	1
baize	1
at	1
the	1
entrance.	1
	1
Almost	1
every	1
time	1
a	1
new	1
carriage	1
drove	1
up	1
a	1
whisper	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
caps	1
were	1
doffed.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor?...	1
No,	1
a	1
minister....	1
prince...	1
ambassador.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
plumes?..."	1
was	1
whispered	1
among	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
One	1
person,	1
better	1
dressed	1
than	1
the	1
rest,	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
everyone	1
and	1
mentioned	1
by	1
name	1
the	1
greatest	1
dignitaries	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
A	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
visitors	1
had	1
already	1
arrived,	1
but	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
present,	1
were	1
still	1
hurrying	1
to	1
get	1
dressed.	1
	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
many	1
discussions	1
and	1
preparations	1
for	1
this	1
ball	1
in	1
the	1
Rostov	1
family,	1
many	1
fears	1
that	1
the	1
invitation	1
would	1
not	1
arrive,	1
that	1
the	1
dresses	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
ready,	1
or	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
arranged	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be.	1
	1
Marya	1
Ignatevna	1
Peronskaya,	1
a	1
thin	1
and	1
shallow	1
maid	1
of	1
honor	1
at	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
piloted	1
the	1
provincial	1
Rostovs	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
high	1
society,	1
was	1
to	1
accompany	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
ball.	1
	1
They	1
were	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
her	1
at	1
her	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
Taurida	1
Gardens	1
at	1
ten	1
o'clock,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
five	1
minutes	1
to	1
ten,	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
were	1
not	1
yet	1
dressed.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
her	1
first	1
grand	1
ball.	1
She	1
had	1
got	1
up	1
at	1
eight	1
that	1
morning	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
fever	1
of	1
excitement	1
and	1
activity	1
all	1
day.	1
All	1
her	1
powers	1
since	1
morning	1
had	1
been	1
concentrated	1
on	1
ensuring	1
that	1
they	1
all--she	1
herself,	1
Mamma,	1
and	1
Sonya--should	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
dressed	1
as	1
possible.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
put	1
themselves	1
entirely	1
in	1
her	1
hands.	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
to	1
wear	1
a	1
claret-colored	1
velvet	1
dress,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
white	1
gauze	1
over	1
pink	1
silk	1
slips,	1
with	1
roses	1
on	1
their	1
bodices	1
and	1
their	1
hair	1
dressed	1
a	1
la	1
grecque.	1
	1
Everything	1
essential	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
done;	1
feet,	1
hands,	1
necks,	1
and	1
ears	1
washed,	1
perfumed,	1
and	1
powdered,	1
as	1
befits	1
a	1
ball;	1
the	1
openwork	1
silk	1
stockings	1
and	1
white	1
satin	1
shoes	1
with	1
ribbons	1
were	1
already	1
on;	1
the	1
hairdressing	1
was	1
almost	1
done.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
finishing	1
dressing	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
the	1
countess,	1
but	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
had	1
bustled	1
about	1
helping	1
them	1
all,	1
was	1
behindhand.	1
She	1
was	1
still	1
sitting	1
before	1
a	1
looking-glass	1
with	1
a	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
thrown	1
over	1
her	1
slender	1
shoulders.	1
Sonya	1
stood	1
ready	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and,	1
pressing	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
pin	1
till	1
it	1
hurt	1
her	1
dainty	1
finger,	1
was	1
fixing	1
on	1
a	1
last	1
ribbon	1
that	1
squeaked	1
as	1
the	1
pin	1
went	1
through	1
it.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
the	1
way,	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
way,	1
Sonya!"	1
cried	1
Natasha	1
turning	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
clutching	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
at	1
her	1
hair	1
which	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
was	1
dressing	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
release.	1
"That	1
bow	1
is	1
not	1
right.	1
Come	1
here!"	1
	1
Sonya	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
Natasha	1
pinned	1
the	1
ribbon	1
on	1
differently.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me,	1
Miss!	1
I	1
can't	1
do	1
it	1
like	1
that,"	1
said	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
Natasha's	1
hair.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
dear!	1
Well	1
then,	1
wait.	1
That's	1
right,	1
Sonya."	1
	1
"Aren't	1
you	1
ready?	1
It	1
is	1
nearly	1
ten,"	1
came	1
the	1
countess'	1
voice.	1
	1
"Directly!	1
Directly!	1
And	1
you,	1
Mamma?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
only	1
my	1
cap	1
to	1
pin	1
on."	1
	1
"Don't	1
do	1
it	1
without	1
me!"	1
called	1
Natasha.	1
"You	1
won't	1
do	1
it	1
right."	1
	1
"But	1
it's	1
already	1
ten."	1
	1
They	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
by	1
half	1
past	1
ten,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
had	1
still	1
to	1
get	1
dressed	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
call	1
at	1
the	1
Taurida	1
Gardens.	1
	1
When	1
her	1
hair	1
was	1
done,	1
Natasha,	1
in	1
her	1
short	1
petticoat	1
from	1
under	1
which	1
her	1
dancing	1
shoes	1
showed,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
mother's	1
dressing	1
jacket,	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
Sonya,	1
scrutinized	1
her,	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
Turning	1
her	1
mother's	1
head	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that,	1
she	1
fastened	1
on	1
the	1
cap	1
and,	1
hurriedly	1
kissing	1
her	1
gray	1
hair,	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
maids	1
who	1
were	1
turning	1
up	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
her	1
skirt.	1
	1
The	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
delay	1
was	1
Natasha's	1
skirt,	1
which	1
was	1
too	1
long.	1
Two	1
maids	1
were	1
turning	1
up	1
the	1
hem	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
biting	1
off	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
thread.	1
A	1
third	1
with	1
pins	1
in	1
her	1
mouth	1
was	1
running	1
about	1
between	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
a	1
fourth	1
held	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
gossamer	1
garment	1
up	1
high	1
on	1
one	1
uplifted	1
hand.	1
	1
"Mavra,	1
quicker,	1
darling!"	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
my	1
thimble,	1
Miss,	1
from	1
there..."	1
	1
"Whenever	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
ready?"	1
asked	1
the	1
count	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
"Here	1
is	1
some	1
scent.	1
Peronskaya	1
must	1
be	1
tired	1
of	1
waiting."	1
	1
"It's	1
ready,	1
Miss,"	1
said	1
the	1
maid,	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
shortened	1
gauze	1
dress	1
with	1
two	1
fingers,	1
and	1
blowing	1
and	1
shaking	1
something	1
off	1
it,	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
this	1
to	1
express	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
airiness	1
and	1
purity	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
held.	1
	1
Natasha	1
began	1
putting	1
on	1
the	1
dress.	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
minute!	1
In	1
a	1
minute!	1
Don't	1
come	1
in,	1
Papa!"	1
she	1
cried	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
door--speaking	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
filmy	1
skirt	1
which	1
still	1
covered	1
her	1
whole	1
face.	1
	1
Sonya	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
to.	1
A	1
minute	1
later	1
they	1
let	1
the	1
count	1
in.	1
He	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
blue	1
swallow-tail	1
coat,	1
shoes	1
and	1
stockings,	1
and	1
was	1
perfumed	1
and	1
his	1
hair	1
pomaded.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Papa!	1
how	1
nice	1
you	1
look!	1
Charming!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
smoothing	1
out	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
the	1
gauze.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
please,	1
Miss!	1
allow	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
maid,	1
who	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
was	1
pulling	1
the	1
skirt	1
straight	1
and	1
shifting	1
the	1
pins	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
mouth	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
her	1
tongue.	1
	1
"Say	1
what	1
you	1
like,"	1
exclaimed	1
Sonya,	1
in	1
a	1
despairing	1
voice	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha,	1
"say	1
what	1
you	1
like,	1
it's	1
still	1
too	1
long."	1
	1
Natasha	1
stepped	1
back	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
pier	1
glass.	1
The	1
dress	1
was	1
too	1
long.	1
	1
"Really,	1
madam,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
too	1
long,"	1
said	1
Mavra,	1
crawling	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
after	1
her	1
young	1
lady.	1
	1
"Well,	1
if	1
it's	1
too	1
long	1
we'll	1
tack	1
it	1
up...	1
we'll	1
tack	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
minute,"	1
said	1
the	1
resolute	1
Dunyasha	1
taking	1
a	1
needle	1
that	1
was	1
stuck	1
on	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
little	1
shawl	1
and,	1
still	1
kneeling	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
once	1
more.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
with	1
soft	1
steps,	1
the	1
countess	1
came	1
in	1
shyly,	1
in	1
her	1
cap	1
and	1
velvet	1
gown.	1
	1
"Oo-oo,	1
my	1
beauty!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
count,	1
"she	1
looks	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
you!"	1
	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
embraced	1
her	1
but,	1
blushing,	1
she	1
stepped	1
aside	1
fearing	1
to	1
be	1
rumpled.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
your	1
cap,	1
more	1
to	1
this	1
side,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"I'll	1
arrange	1
it,"	1
and	1
she	1
rushed	1
forward	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
maids	1
who	1
were	1
tacking	1
up	1
her	1
skirt	1
could	1
not	1
move	1
fast	1
enough	1
and	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
gauze	1
was	1
torn	1
off.	1
	1
"Oh	1
goodness!	1
What	1
has	1
happened?	1
Really	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
my	1
fault!"	1
	1
"Never	1
mind,	1
I'll	1
run	1
it	1
up,	1
it	1
won't	1
show,"	1
said	1
Dunyasha.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
beauty--a	1
very	1
queen!"	1
said	1
the	1
nurse	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
"And	1
Sonya!	1
They	1
are	1
lovely!"	1
	1
At	1
a	1
quarter	1
past	1
ten	1
they	1
at	1
last	1
got	1
into	1
their	1
carriages	1
and	1
started.	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
still	1
to	1
call	1
at	1
the	1
Taurida	1
Gardens.	1
	1
Peronskaya	1
was	1
quite	1
ready.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
age	1
and	1
plainness	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
same	1
process	1
as	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
but	1
with	1
less	1
flurry--for	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
routine.	1
Her	1
ugly	1
old	1
body	1
was	1
washed,	1
perfumed,	1
and	1
powdered	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
She	1
had	1
washed	1
behind	1
her	1
ears	1
just	1
as	1
carefully,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
entered	1
her	1
drawing	1
room	1
in	1
her	1
yellow	1
dress,	1
wearing	1
her	1
badge	1
as	1
maid	1
of	1
honor,	1
her	1
old	1
lady's	1
maid	1
was	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
rapturous	1
admiration	1
as	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
servants	1
had	1
been.	1
	1
She	1
praised	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
toilets.	1
They	1
praised	1
her	1
taste	1
and	1
toilet,	1
and	1
at	1
eleven	1
o'clock,	1
careful	1
of	1
their	1
coiffures	1
and	1
dresses,	1
they	1
settled	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
carriages	1
and	1
drove	1
off.	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
Natasha	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
a	1
moment	1
free	1
since	1
early	1
morning	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
her.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
damp	1
chill	1
air	1
and	1
crowded	1
closeness	1
of	1
the	1
swaying	1
carriage,	1
she	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
vividly	1
imagined	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
her	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
ball,	1
in	1
those	1
brightly	1
lighted	1
rooms--with	1
music,	1
flowers,	1
dances,	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brilliant	1
young	1
people	1
of	1
Petersburg.	1
The	1
prospect	1
was	1
so	1
splendid	1
that	1
she	1
hardly	1
believed	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
true,	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
was	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
chill	1
darkness	1
and	1
closeness	1
of	1
the	1
carriage.	1
She	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
awaited	1
her	1
only	1
when,	1
after	1
stepping	1
over	1
the	1
red	1
baize	1
at	1
the	1
entrance,	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
hall,	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
fur	1
cloak,	1
and,	1
beside	1
Sonya	1
and	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
mounted	1
the	1
brightly	1
illuminated	1
stairs	1
between	1
the	1
flowers.	1
Only	1
then	1
did	1
she	1
remember	1
how	1
she	1
must	1
behave	1
at	1
a	1
ball,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
assume	1
the	1
majestic	1
air	1
she	1
considered	1
indispensable	1
for	1
a	1
girl	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
occasion.	1
But,	1
fortunately	1
for	1
her,	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
eyes	1
growing	1
misty,	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
clearly,	1
her	1
pulse	1
beat	1
a	1
hundred	1
to	1
the	1
minute,	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
throbbed	1
at	1
her	1
heart.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
assume	1
that	1
pose,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
her	1
ridiculous,	1
and	1
she	1
moved	1
on	1
almost	1
fainting	1
from	1
excitement	1
and	1
trying	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might	1
to	1
conceal	1
it.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
attitude	1
that	1
became	1
her	1
best.	1
Before	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
other	1
visitors	1
were	1
entering,	1
also	1
talking	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
and	1
wearing	1
ball	1
dresses.	1
The	1
mirrors	1
on	1
the	1
landing	1
reflected	1
ladies	1
in	1
white,	1
pale-blue,	1
and	1
pink	1
dresses,	1
with	1
diamonds	1
and	1
pearls	1
on	1
their	1
bare	1
necks	1
and	1
arms.	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
mirrors	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
her	1
reflection	1
from	1
the	1
others.	1
All	1
was	1
blended	1
into	1
one	1
brilliant	1
procession.	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
ballroom	1
the	1
regular	1
hum	1
of	1
voices,	1
footsteps,	1
and	1
greetings	1
deafened	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
glitter	1
dazzled	1
her	1
still	1
more.	1
The	1
host	1
and	1
hostess,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
repeating	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
various	1
arrivals,	1
"Charme	1
de	1
vous	1
voir,"	1
*	1
greeted	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
Peronskaya	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Delighted	1
to	1
see	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
two	1
girls	1
in	1
their	1
white	1
dresses,	1
each	1
with	1
a	1
rose	1
in	1
her	1
black	1
hair,	1
both	1
curtsied	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
but	1
the	1
hostess'	1
eye	1
involuntarily	1
rested	1
longer	1
on	1
the	1
slim	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
alone	1
a	1
special	1
smile	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
her	1
usual	1
smile	1
as	1
hostess.	1
Looking	1
at	1
her	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
recalled	1
the	1
golden,	1
irrecoverable	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
girlhood	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
first	1
ball.	1
The	1
host	1
also	1
followed	1
Natasha	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
count	1
which	1
was	1
his	1
daughter.	1
	1
"Charming!"	1
said	1
he,	1
kissing	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
fingers.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
ballroom	1
guests	1
stood	1
crowding	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
doors	1
awaiting	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
The	1
countess	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
rows	1
of	1
that	1
crowd.	1
Natasha	1
heard	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
several	1
people	1
were	1
asking	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
realized	1
that	1
those	1
noticing	1
her	1
liked	1
her,	1
and	1
this	1
observation	1
helped	1
to	1
calm	1
her.	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
some	1
like	1
ourselves	1
and	1
some	1
worse,"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
Peronskaya	1
was	1
pointing	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
ball.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
Dutch	1
ambassador,	1
do	1
you	1
see?	1
That	1
gray-haired	1
man,"	1
she	1
said,	1
indicating	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
profusion	1
of	1
silver-gray	1
curly	1
hair,	1
who	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
ladies	1
laughing	1
at	1
something	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
here	1
she	1
is,	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Petersburg,	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova,"	1
said	1
Peronskaya,	1
indicating	1
Helene	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
entered.	1
"How	1
lovely!	1
She	1
is	1
quite	1
equal	1
to	1
Marya	1
Antonovna.	1
See	1
how	1
the	1
men,	1
young	1
and	1
old,	1
pay	1
court	1
to	1
her.	1
Beautiful	1
and	1
clever...	1
they	1
say	1
Prince--is	1
quite	1
mad	1
about	1
her.	1
But	1
see,	1
those	1
two,	1
though	1
not	1
good-looking,	1
are	1
even	1
more	1
run	1
after."	1
	1
She	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
was	1
crossing	1
the	1
room	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
plain	1
daughter.	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
a	1
splendid	1
match,	1
a	1
millionairess,"	1
said	1
Peronskaya.	1
"And	1
look,	1
here	1
come	1
her	1
suitors."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
Bezukhova's	1
brother,	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin,"	1
she	1
said,	1
indicating	1
a	1
handsome	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
who	1
passed	1
by	1
them	1
with	1
head	1
erect,	1
looking	1
at	1
something	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
ladies.	1
"He's	1
handsome,	1
isn't	1
he?	1
I	1
hear	1
they	1
will	1
marry	1
him	1
to	1
that	1
rich	1
girl.	1
But	1
your	1
cousin,	1
Drubetskoy,	1
is	1
also	1
very	1
attentive	1
to	1
her.	1
They	1
say	1
she	1
has	1
millions.	1
Oh	1
yes,	1
that's	1
the	1
French	1
ambassador	1
himself!"	1
she	1
replied	1
to	1
the	1
countess'	1
inquiry	1
about	1
Caulaincourt.	1
"Looks	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
king!	1
All	1
the	1
same,	1
the	1
French	1
are	1
charming,	1
very	1
charming.	1
No	1
one	1
more	1
charming	1
in	1
society.	1
Ah,	1
here	1
she	1
is!	1
Yes,	1
she	1
is	1
still	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
our	1
Marya	1
Antonovna!	1
And	1
how	1
simply	1
she	1
is	1
dressed!	1
Lovely!	1
And	1
that	1
stout	1
one	1
in	1
spectacles	1
is	1
the	1
universal	1
Freemason,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
indicating	1
Pierre.	1
"Put	1
him	1
beside	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
he	1
looks	1
a	1
regular	1
buffoon!"	1
	1
Pierre,	1
swaying	1
his	1
stout	1
body,	1
advanced,	1
making	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
nodding	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
as	1
casually	1
and	1
good-naturedly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
passing	1
through	1
a	1
crowd	1
at	1
a	1
fair.	1
He	1
pushed	1
through,	1
evidently	1
looking	1
for	1
someone.	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
joyfully	1
at	1
the	1
familiar	1
face	1
of	1
Pierre,	1
"the	1
buffoon,"	1
as	1
Peronskaya	1
had	1
called	1
him,	1
and	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
particular.	1
He	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
introduce	1
partners	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
reached	1
them	1
Pierre	1
stopped	1
beside	1
a	1
very	1
handsome,	1
dark	1
man	1
of	1
middle	1
height,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
uniform,	1
who	1
stood	1
by	1
a	1
window	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
wearing	1
stars	1
and	1
a	1
ribbon.	1
Natasha	1
at	1
once	1
recognized	1
the	1
shorter	1
and	1
younger	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
uniform:	1
it	1
was	1
Bolkonski,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
have	1
grown	1
much	1
younger,	1
happier,	1
and	1
better-looking.	1
	1
"There's	1
someone	1
else	1
we	1
know--Bolkonski,	1
do	1
you	1
see,	1
Mamma?"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
pointing	1
out	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"You	1
remember,	1
he	1
stayed	1
a	1
night	1
with	1
us	1
at	1
Otradnoe."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
know	1
him?"	1
said	1
Peronskaya.	1
"I	1
can't	1
bear	1
him.	1
Il	1
fait	1
a	1
present	1
la	1
pluie	1
et	1
le	1
beau	1
temps.	1
*	1
He's	1
too	1
proud	1
for	1
anything.	1
Takes	1
after	1
his	1
father.	1
And	1
he's	1
hand	1
in	1
glove	1
with	1
Speranski,	1
writing	1
some	1
project	1
or	1
other.	1
Just	1
look	1
how	1
he	1
treats	1
the	1
ladies!	1
There's	1
one	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
turned	1
away,"	1
she	1
said,	1
pointing	1
at	1
him.	1
"I'd	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
treated	1
me	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
those	1
ladies."	1
	1
	1
*	1
"He	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
rage	1
just	1
now."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Suddenly	1
everybody	1
stirred,	1
began	1
talking,	1
and	1
pressed	1
forward	1
and	1
then	1
back,	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
rows,	1
which	1
separated,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
entered	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
music	1
that	1
had	1
immediately	1
struck	1
up.	1
Behind	1
him	1
walked	1
his	1
host	1
and	1
hostess.	1
He	1
walked	1
in	1
rapidly,	1
bowing	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
as	1
if	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
first	1
moments	1
of	1
the	1
reception	1
over.	1
The	1
band	1
played	1
the	1
polonaise	1
in	1
vogue	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
to	1
it,	1
beginning:	1
"Alexander,	1
Elisaveta,	1
all	1
our	1
hearts	1
you	1
ravish	1
quite..."	1
The	1
Emperor	1
passed	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
the	1
crowd	1
made	1
a	1
rush	1
for	1
the	1
doors,	1
and	1
several	1
persons	1
with	1
excited	1
faces	1
hurried	1
there	1
and	1
back	1
again.	1
Then	1
the	1
crowd	1
hastily	1
retired	1
from	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door,	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
reappeared	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
hostess.	1
A	1
young	1
man,	1
looking	1
distraught,	1
pounced	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ladies,	1
asking	1
them	1
to	1
move	1
aside.	1
Some	1
ladies,	1
with	1
faces	1
betraying	1
complete	1
forgetfulness	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
decorum,	1
pushed	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
detriment	1
of	1
their	1
toilets.	1
The	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
choose	1
partners	1
and	1
take	1
their	1
places	1
for	1
the	1
polonaise.	1
	1
Everyone	1
moved	1
back,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
came	1
smiling	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
leading	1
his	1
hostess	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
but	1
not	1
keeping	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
music.	1
The	1
host	1
followed	1
with	1
Marya	1
Antonovna	1
Naryshkina;	1
then	1
came	1
ambassadors,	1
ministers,	1
and	1
various	1
generals,	1
whom	1
Peronskaya	1
diligently	1
named.	1
More	1
than	1
half	1
the	1
ladies	1
already	1
had	1
partners	1
and	1
were	1
taking	1
up,	1
or	1
preparing	1
to	1
take	1
up,	1
their	1
positions	1
for	1
the	1
polonaise.	1
Natasha	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
left	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Sonya	1
among	1
a	1
minority	1
of	1
women	1
who	1
crowded	1
near	1
the	1
wall,	1
not	1
having	1
been	1
invited	1
to	1
dance.	1
She	1
stood	1
with	1
her	1
slender	1
arms	1
hanging	1
down,	1
her	1
scarcely	1
defined	1
bosom	1
rising	1
and	1
falling	1
regularly,	1
and	1
with	1
bated	1
breath	1
and	1
glittering,	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
straight	1
before	1
her,	1
evidently	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
joy	1
or	1
misery.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
concerned	1
about	1
the	1
Emperor	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
great	1
people	1
whom	1
Peronskaya	1
was	1
pointing	1
out--she	1
had	1
but	1
one	1
thought:	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
ask	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
dance?	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
will	1
notice	1
me?	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
me,	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
they	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
saying,	1
'Ah,	1
she's	1
not	1
the	1
one	1
I'm	1
after,	1
so	1
it's	1
not	1
worth	1
looking	1
at	1
her!'	1
No,	1
it's	1
impossible,"	1
she	1
thought.	1
"They	1
must	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
dance,	1
how	1
splendidly	1
I	1
dance,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
enjoy	1
dancing	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
polonaise,	1
which	1
had	1
continued	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time,	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
sound	1
like	1
a	1
sad	1
reminiscence	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
ears.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
cry.	1
Peronskaya	1
had	1
left	1
them.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
Sonya	1
were	1
standing	1
by	1
themselves	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
a	1
forest	1
amid	1
that	1
crowd	1
of	1
strangers,	1
with	1
no	1
one	1
interested	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
not	1
wanted	1
by	1
anyone.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
lady	1
passed	1
by,	1
evidently	1
not	1
recognizing	1
them.	1
The	1
handsome	1
Anatole	1
was	1
smilingly	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
partner	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha	1
as	1
one	1
looks	1
at	1
a	1
wall.	1
Boris	1
passed	1
them	1
twice	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
turned	1
away.	1
Berg	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
dancing,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
This	1
family	1
gathering	1
seemed	1
humiliating	1
to	1
Natasha--as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
nowhere	1
else	1
for	1
the	1
family	1
to	1
talk	1
but	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
ball.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
or	1
look	1
at	1
Vera,	1
who	1
was	1
telling	1
her	1
something	1
about	1
her	1
own	1
green	1
dress.	1
	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
Emperor	1
stopped	1
beside	1
his	1
last	1
partner	1
(he	1
had	1
danced	1
with	1
three)	1
and	1
the	1
music	1
ceased.	1
A	1
worried	1
aide-de-camp	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
requesting	1
them	1
to	1
stand	1
farther	1
back,	1
though	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
were	1
already	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
gallery	1
resounded	1
the	1
distinct,	1
precise,	1
enticingly	1
rhythmical	1
strains	1
of	1
a	1
waltz.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
looked	1
smilingly	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
A	1
minute	1
passed	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
yet	1
begun	1
dancing.	1
An	1
aide-de-camp,	1
the	1
Master	1
of	1
Ceremonies,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
dance.	1
She	1
smilingly	1
raised	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
The	1
aide-de-camp,	1
an	1
adept	1
in	1
his	1
art,	1
grasping	1
his	1
partner	1
firmly	1
round	1
her	1
waist,	1
with	1
confident	1
deliberation	1
started	1
smoothly,	1
gliding	1
first	1
round	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
circle,	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
caught	1
Helene's	1
left	1
hand	1
and	1
turned	1
her,	1
the	1
only	1
sound	1
audible,	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
ever-quickening	1
music,	1
being	1
the	1
rhythmic	1
click	1
of	1
the	1
spurs	1
on	1
his	1
rapid,	1
agile	1
feet,	1
while	1
at	1
every	1
third	1
beat	1
his	1
partner's	1
velvet	1
dress	1
spread	1
out	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
flash	1
as	1
she	1
whirled	1
round.	1
Natasha	1
gazed	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
she	1
who	1
was	1
dancing	1
that	1
first	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
waltz.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
uniform	1
of	1
a	1
cavalry	1
colonel,	1
wearing	1
stockings	1
and	1
dancing	1
shoes,	1
stood	1
looking	1
animated	1
and	1
bright	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
row	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
Baron	1
Firhoff	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
first	1
sitting	1
of	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
State	1
to	1
be	1
held	1
next	1
day.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
one	1
closely	1
connected	1
with	1
Speranski	1
and	1
participating	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
commission,	1
could	1
give	1
reliable	1
information	1
about	1
that	1
sitting,	1
concerning	1
which	1
various	1
rumors	1
were	1
current.	1
But	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
Firhoff	1
was	1
saying,	1
he	1
was	1
gazing	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
sovereign	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
men	1
intending	1
to	1
dance	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
gathered	1
courage	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
circle.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
watching	1
these	1
men	1
abashed	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
presence,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
who	1
were	1
breathlessly	1
longing	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
dance.	1
	1
Pierre	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm.	1
	1
"You	1
always	1
dance.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
protegee,	1
the	1
young	1
Rostova,	1
here.	1
Ask	1
her,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
she?"	1
asked	1
Bolkonski.	1
"Excuse	1
me!"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
baron,	1
"we	1
will	1
finish	1
this	1
conversation	1
elsewhere--at	1
a	1
ball	1
one	1
must	1
dance."	1
He	1
stepped	1
forward	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
Pierre	1
indicated.	1
The	1
despairing,	1
dejected	1
expression	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
caught	1
his	1
eye.	1
He	1
recognized	1
her,	1
guessed	1
her	1
feelings,	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
debut,	1
remembered	1
her	1
conversation	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
pleasure	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
approached	1
Countess	1
Rostova.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
my	1
daughter,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
with	1
heightened	1
color.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
already	1
acquainted,	1
if	1
the	1
countess	1
remembers	1
me,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
and	1
courteous	1
bow	1
quite	1
belying	1
Peronskaya's	1
remarks	1
about	1
his	1
rudeness,	1
and	1
approaching	1
Natasha	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
grasp	1
her	1
waist	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
completed	1
his	1
invitation.	1
He	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
waltz.	1
That	1
tremulous	1
expression	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
face,	1
prepared	1
either	1
for	1
despair	1
or	1
rapture,	1
suddenly	1
brightened	1
into	1
a	1
happy,	1
grateful,	1
childlike	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
you,"	1
that	1
frightened	1
happy	1
little	1
girl	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
by	1
the	1
smile	1
that	1
replaced	1
the	1
threatened	1
tears,	1
as	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
shoulder.	1
They	1
were	1
the	1
second	1
couple	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
circle.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
dancers	1
of	1
his	1
day	1
and	1
Natasha	1
danced	1
exquisitely.	1
Her	1
little	1
feet	1
in	1
their	1
white	1
satin	1
dancing	1
shoes	1
did	1
their	1
work	1
swiftly,	1
lightly,	1
and	1
independently	1
of	1
herself,	1
while	1
her	1
face	1
beamed	1
with	1
ecstatic	1
happiness.	1
Her	1
slender	1
bare	1
arms	1
and	1
neck	1
were	1
not	1
beautiful--compared	1
to	1
Helene's	1
her	1
shoulders	1
looked	1
thin	1
and	1
her	1
bosom	1
undeveloped.	1
But	1
Helene	1
seemed,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
hardened	1
by	1
a	1
varnish	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
looks	1
that	1
had	1
scanned	1
her	1
person,	1
while	1
Natasha	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
girl	1
exposed	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
very	1
much	1
ashamed	1
had	1
she	1
not	1
been	1
assured	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
liked	1
dancing,	1
and	1
wishing	1
to	1
escape	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
the	1
political	1
and	1
clever	1
talk	1
which	1
everyone	1
addressed	1
to	1
him,	1
wishing	1
also	1
to	1
break	1
up	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
restraint	1
he	1
disliked,	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
presence,	1
he	1
danced,	1
and	1
had	1
chosen	1
Natasha	1
because	1
Pierre	1
pointed	1
her	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
pretty	1
girl	1
who	1
caught	1
his	1
eye;	1
but	1
scarcely	1
had	1
he	1
embraced	1
that	1
slender	1
supple	1
figure	1
and	1
felt	1
her	1
stirring	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
smiling	1
so	1
near	1
him	1
than	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
her	1
charm	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
revived	1
and	1
rejuvenated	1
when	1
after	1
leaving	1
her	1
he	1
stood	1
breathing	1
deeply	1
and	1
watching	1
the	1
other	1
dancers.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
After	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
Boris	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
ask	1
Natasha	1
for	1
a	1
dance,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
who	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
ball,	1
and	1
several	1
other	1
young	1
men,	1
so	1
that,	1
flushed	1
and	1
happy,	1
and	1
passing	1
on	1
her	1
superfluous	1
partners	1
to	1
Sonya,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
dancing	1
all	1
the	1
evening.	1
She	1
noticed	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
occupied	1
everyone	1
else.	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
she	1
fail	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
talked	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
ambassador,	1
and	1
how	1
particularly	1
gracious	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
lady,	1
or	1
that	1
Prince	1
So-and-so	1
and	1
So-and-so	1
did	1
and	1
said	1
this	1
and	1
that,	1
and	1
that	1
Helene	1
had	1
great	1
success	1
and	1
was	1
honored	1
by	1
the	1
special	1
attention	1
of	1
So-and-so,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
see	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
only	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
because	1
the	1
ball	1
became	1
livelier	1
after	1
his	1
departure.	1
For	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
merry	1
cotillions	1
before	1
supper	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
again	1
her	1
partner.	1
He	1
reminded	1
her	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
encounter	1
in	1
the	1
Otradnoe	1
avenue,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
sleep	1
that	1
moonlight	1
night,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
involuntarily	1
overheard	1
her.	1
Natasha	1
blushed	1
at	1
that	1
recollection	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
excuse	1
herself,	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
something	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
in	1
what	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
overheard.	1
	1
Like	1
all	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
grown	1
up	1
in	1
society,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
liked	1
meeting	1
someone	1
there	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
conventional	1
society	1
stamp.	1
And	1
such	1
was	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
her	1
surprise,	1
her	1
delight,	1
her	1
shyness,	1
and	1
even	1
her	1
mistakes	1
in	1
speaking	1
French.	1
With	1
her	1
he	1
behaved	1
with	1
special	1
care	1
and	1
tenderness,	1
sitting	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
unimportant	1
matters;	1
he	1
admired	1
her	1
shy	1
grace.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
cotillion,	1
having	1
completed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
figures,	1
Natasha,	1
still	1
out	1
of	1
breath,	1
was	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
seat	1
when	1
another	1
dancer	1
chose	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
tired	1
and	1
panting	1
and	1
evidently	1
thought	1
of	1
declining,	1
but	1
immediately	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
gaily	1
on	1
the	1
man's	1
shoulder,	1
smiling	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"I'd	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
sit	1
beside	1
you	1
and	1
rest:	1
I'm	1
tired;	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
keep	1
asking	1
me,	1
and	1
I'm	1
glad	1
of	1
it,	1
I'm	1
happy	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
everybody,	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
understand	1
it	1
all,"	1
and	1
much,	1
much	1
more	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
smile.	1
When	1
her	1
partner	1
left	1
her	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
choose	1
two	1
ladies	1
for	1
the	1
figure.	1
	1
"If	1
she	1
goes	1
to	1
her	1
cousin	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
another	1
lady,	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
wife,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
himself	1
quite	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
surprise,	1
as	1
he	1
watched	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
go	1
first	1
to	1
her	1
cousin.	1
	1
"What	1
rubbish	1
sometimes	1
enters	1
one's	1
head!"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"but	1
what	1
is	1
certain	1
is	1
that	1
that	1
girl	1
is	1
so	1
charming,	1
so	1
original,	1
that	1
she	1
won't	1
be	1
dancing	1
here	1
a	1
month	1
before	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
married....	1
Such	1
as	1
she	1
are	1
rare	1
here,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
as	1
Natasha,	1
readjusting	1
a	1
rose	1
that	1
was	1
slipping	1
on	1
her	1
bodice,	1
settled	1
herself	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
cotillion	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
in	1
his	1
blue	1
coat	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dancers.	1
He	1
invited	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
them,	1
and	1
asked	1
his	1
daughter	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
enjoying	1
herself.	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
at	1
once	1
but	1
only	1
looked	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
said	1
reproachfully:	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
ask	1
such	1
a	1
question?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
enjoyed	1
myself	1
so	1
much	1
before!"	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
noticed	1
how	1
her	1
thin	1
arms	1
rose	1
quickly	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
embrace	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
instantly	1
dropped	1
again.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
happier	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
in	1
her	1
life.	1
She	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
height	1
of	1
bliss	1
when	1
one	1
becomes	1
completely	1
kind	1
and	1
good	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
evil,	1
unhappiness,	1
or	1
sorrow.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
ball	1
Pierre	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
felt	1
humiliated	1
by	1
the	1
position	1
his	1
wife	1
occupied	1
in	1
court	1
circles.	1
He	1
was	1
gloomy	1
and	1
absent-minded.	1
A	1
deep	1
furrow	1
ran	1
across	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
standing	1
by	1
a	1
window	1
he	1
stared	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
seeing	1
no	1
one.	1
	1
On	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
supper	1
Natasha	1
passed	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
gloomy,	1
unhappy	1
look	1
struck	1
her.	1
She	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
She	1
wished	1
to	1
help	1
him,	1
to	1
bestow	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
superabundance	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
happiness.	1
	1
"How	1
delightful	1
it	1
is,	1
Count!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Isn't	1
it?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
smiled	1
absent-mindedly,	1
evidently	1
not	1
grasping	1
what	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
people	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
anything?"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
"Especially	1
such	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
as	1
Bezukhov!"	1
In	1
Natasha's	1
eyes	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
alike	1
were	1
good,	1
kind,	1
and	1
splendid	1
people,	1
loving	1
one	1
another;	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
capable	1
of	1
injuring	1
another--and	1
so	1
they	1
ought	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
happy.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
ball,	1
but	1
his	1
mind	1
did	1
not	1
dwell	1
on	1
it	1
long.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
brilliant	1
ball,"	1
and	1
then...	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
little	1
Rostova	1
is	1
very	1
charming.	1
There's	1
something	1
fresh,	1
original,	1
un-	1
Petersburg-like	1
about	1
her	1
that	1
distinguishes	1
her."	1
That	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
thought	1
about	1
yesterday's	1
ball,	1
and	1
after	1
his	1
morning	1
tea	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work.	1
	1
But	1
either	1
from	1
fatigue	1
or	1
want	1
of	1
sleep	1
he	1
was	1
ill-disposed	1
for	1
work	1
and	1
could	1
get	1
nothing	1
done.	1
He	1
kept	1
criticizing	1
his	1
own	1
work,	1
as	1
he	1
often	1
did,	1
and	1
was	1
glad	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
someone	1
coming.	1
	1
The	1
visitor	1
was	1
Bitski,	1
who	1
served	1
on	1
various	1
committees,	1
frequented	1
all	1
the	1
societies	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
a	1
passionate	1
devotee	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
ideas	1
and	1
of	1
Speranski,	1
and	1
a	1
diligent	1
Petersburg	1
newsmonger--one	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
choose	1
their	1
opinions	1
like	1
their	1
clothes	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fashion,	1
but	1
who	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
warmest	1
partisans.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
he	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
his	1
hat	1
before	1
he	1
ran	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
preoccupied	1
air	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
talking.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
heard	1
particulars	1
of	1
that	1
morning's	1
sitting	1
of	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
State	1
opened	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
it	1
enthusiastically.	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
speech	1
had	1
been	1
extraordinary.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
speech	1
such	1
as	1
only	1
constitutional	1
monarchs	1
deliver.	1
"The	1
Sovereign	1
plainly	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Council	1
and	1
Senate	1
are	1
estates	1
of	1
the	1
realm,	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
must	1
rest	1
not	1
on	1
authority	1
but	1
on	1
secure	1
bases.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
fiscal	1
system	1
must	1
be	1
reorganized	1
and	1
the	1
accounts	1
published,"	1
recounted	1
Bitski,	1
emphasizing	1
certain	1
words	1
and	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes	1
significantly.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes!	1
Today's	1
events	1
mark	1
an	1
epoch,	1
the	1
greatest	1
epoch	1
in	1
our	1
history,"	1
he	1
concluded.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
State,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
impatiently	1
awaited	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
attached	1
such	1
importance,	1
and	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
this	1
event,	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
did	1
not	1
affect	1
him,	1
and	1
even	1
seemed	1
quite	1
insignificant.	1
He	1
listened	1
with	1
quiet	1
irony	1
to	1
Bitski's	1
enthusiastic	1
account	1
of	1
it.	1
A	1
very	1
simple	1
thought	1
occurred	1
to	1
him:	1
"What	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
me	1
or	1
to	1
Bitski	1
what	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
say	1
at	1
the	1
Council?	1
Can	1
all	1
that	1
make	1
me	1
any	1
happier	1
or	1
better?"	1
	1
And	1
this	1
simple	1
reflection	1
suddenly	1
destroyed	1
all	1
the	1
interest	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
felt	1
in	1
the	1
impending	1
reforms.	1
He	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
dine	1
that	1
evening	1
at	1
Speranski's,	1
"with	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
friends,"	1
as	1
the	1
host	1
had	1
said	1
when	1
inviting	1
him.	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
that	1
dinner	1
in	1
the	1
intimate	1
home	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
so	1
admired	1
had	1
greatly	1
interested	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
Speranski	1
in	1
his	1
domestic	1
surroundings,	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
disinclined	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour,	1
however,	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
modest	1
house	1
Speranski	1
owned	1
in	1
the	1
Taurida	1
Gardens.	1
In	1
the	1
parqueted	1
dining	1
room	1
this	1
small	1
house,	1
remarkable	1
for	1
its	1
extreme	1
cleanliness	1
(suggesting	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
monastery),	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
was	1
rather	1
late,	1
found	1
the	1
friendly	1
gathering	1
of	1
Speranski's	1
intimate	1
acquaintances	1
already	1
assembled	1
at	1
five	1
o'clock.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
ladies	1
present	1
except	1
Speranski's	1
little	1
daughter	1
(long-faced	1
like	1
her	1
father)	1
and	1
her	1
governess.	1
The	1
other	1
guests	1
were	1
Gervais,	1
Magnitski,	1
and	1
Stolypin.	1
While	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
heard	1
loud	1
voices	1
and	1
a	1
ringing	1
staccato	1
laugh--a	1
laugh	1
such	1
as	1
one	1
hears	1
on	1
the	1
stage.	1
Someone--it	1
sounded	1
like	1
Speranski--was	1
distinctly	1
ejaculating	1
ha-ha-ha.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
heard	1
Speranski's	1
famous	1
laugh,	1
and	1
this	1
ringing,	1
high-pitched	1
laughter	1
from	1
a	1
statesman	1
made	1
a	1
strange	1
impression	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
He	1
entered	1
the	1
dining	1
room.	1
The	1
whole	1
company	1
were	1
standing	1
between	1
two	1
windows	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
table	1
laid	1
with	1
hors-d'oeuvres.	1
Speranski,	1
wearing	1
a	1
gray	1
swallow-tail	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
star	1
on	1
the	1
breast,	1
and	1
evidently	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
high	1
white	1
stock	1
he	1
had	1
worn	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
State,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
countenance.	1
His	1
guests	1
surrounded	1
him.	1
Magnitski,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
Speranski,	1
was	1
relating	1
an	1
anecdote,	1
and	1
Speranski	1
was	1
laughing	1
in	1
advance	1
at	1
what	1
Magnitski	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say.	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
Magnitski's	1
words	1
were	1
again	1
crowned	1
by	1
laughter.	1
Stolypin	1
gave	1
a	1
deep	1
bass	1
guffaw	1
as	1
he	1
munched	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese.	1
Gervais	1
laughed	1
softly	1
with	1
a	1
hissing	1
chuckle,	1
and	1
Speranski	1
in	1
a	1
high-pitched	1
staccato	1
manner.	1
	1
Still	1
laughing,	1
Speranski	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
soft	1
white	1
hand	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Very	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
Prince,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"One	1
moment..."	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Magnitski	1
and	1
interrupting	1
his	1
story.	1
"We	1
have	1
agreed	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
dinner	1
for	1
recreation,	1
with	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
business!"	1
and	1
turning	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
narrator	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
afresh.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
laughing	1
Speranski	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
regret,	1
and	1
disillusionment.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
Speranski	1
but	1
someone	1
else.	1
Everything	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
appeared	1
mysterious	1
and	1
fascinating	1
in	1
Speranski	1
suddenly	1
became	1
plain	1
and	1
unattractive.	1
	1
At	1
dinner	1
the	1
conversation	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
consist	1
of	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
funny	1
anecdotes.	1
Before	1
Magnitski	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
story	1
someone	1
else	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
relate	1
something	1
still	1
funnier.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
anecdotes,	1
if	1
not	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
service,	1
related	1
to	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
service.	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
company	1
the	1
insignificance	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
was	1
so	1
definitely	1
accepted	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
possible	1
attitude	1
toward	1
them	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
good	1
humored	1
ridicule.	1
Speranski	1
related	1
how	1
at	1
the	1
Council	1
that	1
morning	1
a	1
deaf	1
dignitary,	1
when	1
asked	1
his	1
opinion,	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
so	1
too.	1
Gervais	1
gave	1
a	1
long	1
account	1
of	1
an	1
official	1
revision,	1
remarkable	1
for	1
the	1
stupidity	1
of	1
everybody	1
concerned.	1
Stolypin,	1
stuttering,	1
broke	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
began	1
excitedly	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
abuses	1
that	1
existed	1
under	1
the	1
former	1
order	1
of	1
things--threatening	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
serious	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
conversation.	1
Magnitski	1
starting	1
quizzing	1
Stolypin	1
about	1
his	1
vehemence.	1
Gervais	1
intervened	1
with	1
a	1
joke,	1
and	1
the	1
talk	1
reverted	1
to	1
its	1
former	1
lively	1
tone.	1
	1
Evidently	1
Speranski	1
liked	1
to	1
rest	1
after	1
his	1
labors	1
and	1
find	1
amusement	1
in	1
a	1
circle	1
of	1
friends,	1
and	1
his	1
guests,	1
understanding	1
his	1
wish,	1
tried	1
to	1
enliven	1
him	1
and	1
amuse	1
themselves.	1
But	1
their	1
gaiety	1
seemed	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
mirthless	1
and	1
tiresome.	1
Speranski's	1
high-pitched	1
voice	1
struck	1
him	1
unpleasantly,	1
and	1
the	1
incessant	1
laughter	1
grated	1
on	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
false	1
note.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
laugh	1
and	1
feared	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
damper	1
on	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
took	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
out	1
of	1
harmony	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
mood.	1
They	1
all	1
seemed	1
very	1
gay.	1
	1
He	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
conversation,	1
but	1
his	1
remarks	1
were	1
tossed	1
aside	1
each	1
time	1
like	1
a	1
cork	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
jest	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
wrong	1
or	1
unseemly	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
said,	1
it	1
was	1
witty	1
and	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
funny,	1
but	1
it	1
lacked	1
just	1
that	1
something	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
salt	1
of	1
mirth,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
even	1
aware	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
existed.	1
	1
After	1
dinner	1
Speranski's	1
daughter	1
and	1
her	1
governess	1
rose.	1
He	1
patted	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
with	1
his	1
white	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
And	1
that	1
gesture,	1
too,	1
seemed	1
unnatural	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
The	1
men	1
remained	1
at	1
table	1
over	1
their	1
port--English	1
fashion.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
that	1
was	1
started	1
about	1
Napoleon's	1
Spanish	1
affairs,	1
which	1
they	1
all	1
agreed	1
in	1
approving,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
began	1
to	1
express	1
a	1
contrary	1
opinion.	1
Speranski	1
smiled	1
and,	1
with	1
an	1
evident	1
wish	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
conversation	1
from	1
taking	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
course,	1
told	1
a	1
story	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
previous	1
conversation.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
all	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
Having	1
sat	1
some	1
time	1
at	1
table,	1
Speranski	1
corked	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
and,	1
remarking,	1
"Nowadays	1
good	1
wine	1
rides	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
and	1
pair,"	1
passed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
and	1
got	1
up.	1
All	1
rose	1
and	1
continuing	1
to	1
talk	1
loudly	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Two	1
letters	1
brought	1
by	1
a	1
courier	1
were	1
handed	1
to	1
Speranski	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
study.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
general	1
merriment	1
stopped	1
and	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
converse	1
sensibly	1
and	1
quietly	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
"Now	1
for	1
the	1
recitation!"	1
said	1
Speranski	1
on	1
returning	1
from	1
his	1
study.	1
"A	1
wonderful	1
talent!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
Magnitski	1
immediately	1
assumed	1
a	1
pose	1
and	1
began	1
reciting	1
some	1
humorous	1
verses	1
in	1
French	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
composed	1
about	1
various	1
well-known	1
Petersburg	1
people.	1
He	1
was	1
interrupted	1
several	1
times	1
by	1
applause.	1
When	1
the	1
verses	1
were	1
finished	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Speranski	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
leave.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to	1
so	1
early?"	1
asked	1
Speranski.	1
	1
"I	1
promised	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
reception."	1
	1
They	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
closely	1
into	1
those	1
mirrorlike,	1
impenetrable	1
eyes,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
ridiculous	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
expected	1
anything	1
from	1
Speranski	1
and	1
from	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
activities	1
connected	1
with	1
him,	1
or	1
ever	1
to	1
have	1
attributed	1
importance	1
to	1
what	1
Speranski	1
was	1
doing.	1
That	1
precise,	1
mirthless	1
laughter	1
rang	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
ears	1
long	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
home	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
began	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
during	1
those	1
last	1
four	1
months	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
new.	1
He	1
recalled	1
his	1
exertions	1
and	1
solicitations,	1
and	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
project	1
of	1
army	1
reform,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
accepted	1
for	1
consideration	1
and	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
in	1
silence	1
simply	1
because	1
another,	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
one,	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
prepared	1
and	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
meetings	1
of	1
a	1
committee	1
of	1
which	1
Berg	1
was	1
a	1
member.	1
He	1
remembered	1
how	1
carefully	1
and	1
at	1
what	1
length	1
everything	1
relating	1
to	1
form	1
and	1
procedure	1
was	1
discussed	1
at	1
those	1
meetings,	1
and	1
how	1
sedulously	1
and	1
promptly	1
all	1
that	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
was	1
evaded.	1
He	1
recalled	1
his	1
labors	1
on	1
the	1
Legal	1
Code,	1
and	1
how	1
painstakingly	1
he	1
had	1
translated	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
the	1
Roman	1
and	1
French	1
codes	1
into	1
Russian,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
himself.	1
Then	1
he	1
vividly	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
Bogucharovo,	1
his	1
occupations	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
his	1
journey	1
to	1
Ryazan;	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
Dron	1
the	1
village	1
elder,	1
and	1
mentally	1
applying	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
Personal	1
Rights	1
he	1
had	1
divided	1
into	1
paragraphs,	1
he	1
felt	1
astonished	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
spent	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
on	1
such	1
useless	1
work.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
called	1
at	1
a	1
few	1
houses	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
visited	1
before,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
renewed	1
acquaintance	1
at	1
the	1
ball.	1
Apart	1
from	1
considerations	1
of	1
politeness	1
which	1
demanded	1
the	1
call,	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
original,	1
eager	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
such	1
a	1
pleasant	1
impression	1
on	1
his	1
mind,	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
She	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
dark-blue	1
house	1
dress	1
in	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
thought	1
her	1
even	1
prettier	1
than	1
in	1
her	1
ball	1
dress.	1
She	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Rostov	1
family	1
welcomed	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
friend,	1
simply	1
and	1
cordially.	1
The	1
whole	1
family,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
judged	1
severely,	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
consist	1
of	1
excellent,	1
simple,	1
and	1
kindly	1
people.	1
The	1
old	1
count's	1
hospitality	1
and	1
good	1
nature,	1
which	1
struck	1
one	1
especially	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
as	1
a	1
pleasant	1
surprise,	1
were	1
such	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
stay	1
to	1
dinner.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"they	1
are	1
capital	1
people,	1
who	1
of	1
course	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
idea	1
what	1
a	1
treasure	1
they	1
possess	1
in	1
Natasha;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
kindly	1
folk	1
and	1
form	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
setting	1
for	1
this	1
strikingly	1
poetic,	1
charming	1
girl,	1
overflowing	1
with	1
life!"	1
	1
In	1
Natasha	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
world	1
completely	1
alien	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
brimful	1
of	1
joys	1
unknown	1
to	1
him,	1
a	1
different	1
world,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
Otradnoe	1
avenue	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
that	1
moonlight	1
night	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
disconcert	1
him.	1
Now	1
this	1
world	1
disconcerted	1
him	1
no	1
longer	1
and	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
alien	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
having	1
entered	1
it	1
found	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
new	1
enjoyment.	1
	1
After	1
dinner	1
Natasha,	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
request,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
began	1
singing.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stood	1
by	1
a	1
window	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
her.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
phrase	1
he	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
and	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
tears	1
choking	1
him,	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
impossible	1
for	1
him.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha	1
as	1
she	1
sang,	1
and	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
joyful	1
stirred	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
felt	1
happy	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
sad.	1
He	1
had	1
absolutely	1
nothing	1
to	1
weep	1
about	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
weep.	1
What	1
about?	1
His	1
former	1
love?	1
The	1
little	1
princess?	1
His	1
disillusionments?...	1
His	1
hopes	1
for	1
the	1
future?...	1
Yes	1
and	1
no.	1
The	1
chief	1
reason	1
was	1
a	1
sudden,	1
vivid	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
contrast	1
between	1
something	1
infinitely	1
great	1
and	1
illimitable	1
within	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
limited	1
and	1
material	1
something	1
that	1
he,	1
and	1
even	1
she,	1
was.	1
This	1
contrast	1
weighed	1
on	1
and	1
yet	1
cheered	1
him	1
while	1
she	1
sang.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Natasha	1
had	1
finished	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
asked	1
how	1
he	1
liked	1
her	1
voice.	1
She	1
asked	1
this	1
and	1
then	1
became	1
confused,	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
asked	1
it.	1
He	1
smiled,	1
looking	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
liked	1
her	1
singing	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
everything	1
she	1
did.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
left	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
from	1
habit,	1
but	1
soon	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sleep.	1
Having	1
lit	1
his	1
candle	1
he	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
bed,	1
then	1
got	1
up,	1
then	1
lay	1
down	1
again	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
troubled	1
by	1
his	1
sleeplessness:	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
joyful	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
stuffy	1
room	1
into	1
God's	1
own	1
fresh	1
air.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
enter	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Natasha;	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
about	1
her,	1
but	1
only	1
picturing	1
her	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
all	1
life	1
appeared	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
light.	1
"Why	1
do	1
I	1
strive,	1
why	1
do	1
I	1
toil	1
in	1
this	1
narrow,	1
confined	1
frame,	1
when	1
life,	1
all	1
life	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
joys,	1
is	1
open	1
to	1
me?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself.	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
began	1
making	1
happy	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
He	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
attend	1
to	1
his	1
son's	1
education	1
by	1
finding	1
a	1
tutor	1
and	1
putting	1
the	1
boy	1
in	1
his	1
charge,	1
then	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
go	1
abroad,	1
and	1
see	1
England,	1
Switzerland	1
and	1
Italy.	1
"I	1
must	1
use	1
my	1
freedom	1
while	1
I	1
feel	1
so	1
much	1
strength	1
and	1
youth	1
in	1
me,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Pierre	1
was	1
right	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
one	1
must	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
happiness	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
happy,	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
it.	1
Let	1
the	1
dead	1
bury	1
their	1
dead,	1
but	1
while	1
one	1
has	1
life	1
one	1
must	1
live	1
and	1
be	1
happy!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
One	1
morning	1
Colonel	1
Berg,	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
everybody	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
Petersburg,	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Berg	1
arrived	1
in	1
an	1
immaculate	1
brand-new	1
uniform,	1
with	1
his	1
hair	1
pomaded	1
and	1
brushed	1
forward	1
over	1
his	1
temples	1
as	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
wore	1
his	1
hair.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
countess,	1
your	1
wife.	1
Unfortunately	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
grant	1
my	1
request,	1
but	1
I	1
hope,	1
Count,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
fortunate	1
with	1
you,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
wish,	1
Colonel?	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
your	1
service."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
now	1
quite	1
settled	1
in	1
my	1
new	1
rooms,	1
Count"	1
(Berg	1
said	1
this	1
with	1
perfect	1
conviction	1
that	1
this	1
information	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
agreeable),	1
"and	1
so	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
arrange	1
just	1
a	1
small	1
party	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
and	1
my	1
wife's	1
friends."	1
(He	1
smiled	1
still	1
more	1
pleasantly.)	1
"I	1
wished	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
coming	1
to	1
tea	1
and	1
to	1
supper."	1
	1
Only	1
Countess	1
Helene,	1
considering	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
such	1
people	1
as	1
the	1
Bergs	1
beneath	1
her,	1
could	1
be	1
cruel	1
enough	1
to	1
refuse	1
such	1
an	1
invitation.	1
Berg	1
explained	1
so	1
clearly	1
why	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
collect	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
a	1
small	1
but	1
select	1
company,	1
and	1
why	1
this	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
why	1
though	1
he	1
grudged	1
spending	1
money	1
on	1
cards	1
or	1
anything	1
harmful,	1
he	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
run	1
into	1
some	1
expense	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
good	1
society--that	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
refuse,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
"But	1
don't	1
be	1
late,	1
Count,	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
venture	1
to	1
ask;	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes	1
to	1
eight,	1
please.	1
We	1
shall	1
make	1
up	1
a	1
rubber.	1
Our	1
general	1
is	1
coming.	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
to	1
me.	1
We	1
shall	1
have	1
supper,	1
Count.	1
So	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
favor."	1
	1
Contrary	1
to	1
his	1
habit	1
of	1
being	1
late,	1
Pierre	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
Bergs'	1
house,	1
not	1
at	1
ten	1
but	1
at	1
fifteen	1
minutes	1
to	1
eight.	1
	1
Having	1
prepared	1
everything	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
party,	1
the	1
Bergs	1
were	1
ready	1
for	1
their	1
guests'	1
arrival.	1
	1
In	1
their	1
new,	1
clean,	1
and	1
light	1
study	1
with	1
its	1
small	1
busts	1
and	1
pictures	1
and	1
new	1
furniture	1
sat	1
Berg	1
and	1
his	1
wife.	1
Berg,	1
closely	1
buttoned	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
new	1
uniform,	1
sat	1
beside	1
his	1
wife	1
explaining	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
one	1
always	1
could	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
people	1
above	1
one,	1
because	1
only	1
then	1
does	1
one	1
get	1
satisfaction	1
from	1
acquaintances.	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
get	1
to	1
know	1
something,	1
you	1
can	1
ask	1
for	1
something.	1
See	1
how	1
I	1
managed	1
from	1
my	1
first	1
promotion."	1
(Berg	1
measured	1
his	1
life	1
not	1
by	1
years	1
but	1
by	1
promotions.)	1
"My	1
comrades	1
are	1
still	1
nobodies,	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
vacancy	1
to	1
command	1
a	1
regiment,	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
happiness	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
husband."	1
(He	1
rose	1
and	1
kissed	1
Vera's	1
hand,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
her	1
straightened	1
out	1
a	1
turned-up	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
carpet.)	1
"And	1
how	1
have	1
I	1
obtained	1
all	1
this?	1
Chiefly	1
by	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
choose	1
my	1
aquaintances.	1
It	1
goes	1
without	1
saying	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
conscientious	1
and	1
methodical."	1
	1
Berg	1
smiled	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
superiority	1
over	1
a	1
weak	1
woman,	1
and	1
paused,	1
reflecting	1
that	1
this	1
dear	1
wife	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
after	1
all	1
but	1
a	1
weak	1
woman	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
all	1
that	1
constitutes	1
a	1
man's	1
dignity,	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
ein	1
Mann	1
zu	1
sein.	1
*	1
Vera	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
smiling	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
superiority	1
over	1
her	1
good,	1
conscientious	1
husband,	1
who	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
understood	1
life	1
wrongly,	1
as	1
according	1
to	1
Vera	1
all	1
men	1
did.	1
Berg,	1
judging	1
by	1
his	1
wife,	1
thought	1
all	1
women	1
weak	1
and	1
foolish.	1
Vera,	1
judging	1
only	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
generalizing	1
from	1
that	1
observation,	1
supposed	1
that	1
all	1
men,	1
though	1
they	1
understand	1
nothing	1
and	1
are	1
conceited	1
and	1
selfish,	1
ascribe	1
common	1
sense	1
to	1
themselves	1
alone.	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
be	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
Berg	1
rose	1
and	1
embraced	1
his	1
wife	1
carefully,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
crush	1
her	1
lace	1
fichu	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
paid	1
a	1
good	1
price,	1
kissing	1
her	1
straight	1
on	1
the	1
lips.	1
	1
"The	1
only	1
thing	1
is,	1
we	1
mustn't	1
have	1
children	1
too	1
soon,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
following	1
an	1
unconscious	1
sequence	1
of	1
ideas.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
Vera,	1
"I	1
don't	1
at	1
all	1
want	1
that.	1
We	1
must	1
live	1
for	1
society."	1
	1
"Princess	1
Yusupova	1
wore	1
one	1
exactly	1
like	1
this,"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
fichu	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
kindly	1
smile.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
was	1
announced.	1
Husband	1
and	1
wife	1
glanced	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
both	1
smiling	1
with	1
self-satisfaction,	1
and	1
each	1
mentally	1
claiming	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
this	1
visit.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
acquaintances,"	1
thought	1
Berg.	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
conduct	1
oneself."	1
	1
"But	1
please	1
don't	1
interrupt	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
entertaining	1
the	1
guests,"	1
said	1
Vera,	1
"because	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
interests	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
different	1
people."	1
	1
Berg	1
smiled	1
again.	1
	1
"It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped:	1
men	1
must	1
sometimes	1
have	1
masculine	1
conversation,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
They	1
received	1
Pierre	1
in	1
their	1
small,	1
new	1
drawing-room,	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
anywhere	1
without	1
disturbing	1
its	1
symmetry,	1
neatness,	1
and	1
order;	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
comprehensible	1
and	1
not	1
strange	1
that	1
Berg,	1
having	1
generously	1
offered	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
symmetry	1
of	1
an	1
armchair	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
for	1
his	1
dear	1
guest,	1
but	1
being	1
apparently	1
painfully	1
undecided	1
on	1
the	1
matter	1
himself,	1
eventually	1
left	1
the	1
visitor	1
to	1
settle	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
selection.	1
Pierre	1
disturbed	1
the	1
symmetry	1
by	1
moving	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
Berg	1
and	1
Vera	1
immediately	1
began	1
their	1
evening	1
party,	1
interrupting	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
their	1
efforts	1
to	1
entertain	1
their	1
guest.	1
	1
Vera,	1
having	1
decided	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
Pierre	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
entertained	1
with	1
conversation	1
about	1
the	1
French	1
embassy,	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
accordingly.	1
Berg,	1
having	1
decided	1
that	1
masculine	1
conversation	1
was	1
required,	1
interrupted	1
his	1
wife's	1
remarks	1
and	1
touched	1
on	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Austria,	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
jumped	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
subject	1
to	1
personal	1
considerations	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
proposals	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
Austrian	1
campaign	1
and	1
the	1
reasons	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
declined	1
them.	1
Though	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
very	1
incoherent	1
and	1
Vera	1
was	1
angry	1
at	1
the	1
intrusion	1
of	1
the	1
masculine	1
element,	1
both	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
felt	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
that,	1
even	1
if	1
only	1
one	1
guest	1
was	1
present,	1
their	1
evening	1
had	1
begun	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
was	1
as	1
like	1
as	1
two	1
peas	1
to	1
every	1
other	1
evening	1
party	1
with	1
its	1
talk,	1
tea,	1
and	1
lighted	1
candles.	1
	1
Before	1
long	1
Boris,	1
Berg's	1
old	1
comrade,	1
arrived.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
condescension	1
and	1
patronage	1
in	1
his	1
treatment	1
of	1
Berg	1
and	1
Vera.	1
After	1
Boris	1
came	1
a	1
lady	1
with	1
the	1
colonel,	1
then	1
the	1
general	1
himself,	1
then	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
and	1
the	1
party	1
became	1
unquestionably	1
exactly	1
like	1
all	1
other	1
evening	1
parties.	1
Berg	1
and	1
Vera	1
could	1
not	1
repress	1
their	1
smiles	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
movement	1
in	1
their	1
drawing	1
room,	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
disconnected	1
talk,	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
dresses,	1
and	1
the	1
bowing	1
and	1
scraping.	1
Everything	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
everybody	1
always	1
has	1
it,	1
especially	1
so	1
the	1
general,	1
who	1
admired	1
the	1
apartment,	1
patted	1
Berg	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
with	1
parental	1
authority	1
superintended	1
the	1
setting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
for	1
boston.	1
The	1
general	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
guest.	1
The	1
old	1
people	1
sat	1
with	1
the	1
old,	1
the	1
young	1
with	1
the	1
young,	1
and	1
the	1
hostess	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table,	1
on	1
which	1
stood	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
cakes	1
in	1
a	1
silver	1
cake	1
basket	1
as	1
the	1
Panins	1
had	1
at	1
their	1
party.	1
Everything	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
everywhere	1
else.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
Pierre,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
guests,	1
had	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
boston	1
with	1
Count	1
Rostov,	1
the	1
general,	1
and	1
the	1
colonel.	1
At	1
the	1
card	1
table	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
directly	1
facing	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
curious	1
change	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
her	1
since	1
the	1
ball.	1
She	1
was	1
silent,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
less	1
pretty	1
than	1
at	1
the	1
ball,	1
but	1
only	1
redeemed	1
from	1
plainness	1
by	1
her	1
look	1
of	1
gentle	1
indifference	1
to	1
everything	1
around.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
her?"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
glancing	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
by	1
her	1
sister	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table,	1
and	1
reluctantly,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
made	1
some	1
reply	1
to	1
Boris	1
who	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her.	1
After	1
playing	1
out	1
a	1
whole	1
suit	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
partner's	1
delight	1
taking	1
five	1
tricks,	1
Pierre,	1
hearing	1
greetings	1
and	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
someone	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
picking	1
up	1
his	1
tricks,	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"What	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
her?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
with	1
still	1
greater	1
surprise.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
standing	1
before	1
her,	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
tender	1
solicitude.	1
She,	1
having	1
raised	1
her	1
head,	1
was	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
him,	1
flushed	1
and	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
master	1
her	1
rapid	1
breathing.	1
And	1
the	1
bright	1
glow	1
of	1
some	1
inner	1
fire	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
suppressed	1
was	1
again	1
alight	1
in	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
completely	1
transformed	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
plain	1
girl	1
had	1
again	1
become	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
ball.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
noticed	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
youthful	1
expression	1
in	1
his	1
friend's	1
face.	1
	1
Pierre	1
changed	1
places	1
several	1
times	1
during	1
the	1
game,	1
sitting	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
Natasha	1
and	1
now	1
facing	1
her,	1
but	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
six	1
rubbers	1
he	1
watched	1
her	1
and	1
his	1
friend.	1
	1
"Something	1
very	1
important	1
is	1
happening	1
between	1
them,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
was	1
both	1
joyful	1
and	1
painful	1
agitated	1
him	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
neglect	1
the	1
game.	1
	1
After	1
six	1
rubbers	1
the	1
general	1
got	1
up,	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
use	1
playing	1
like	1
that,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
was	1
released.	1
Natasha	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
was	1
talking	1
with	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Boris,	1
and	1
Vera	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
and,	1
asking	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
secrets,	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
them.	1
Vera,	1
having	1
noticed	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
attentions	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
decided	1
that	1
at	1
a	1
party,	1
a	1
real	1
evening	1
party,	1
subtle	1
allusions	1
to	1
the	1
tender	1
passion	1
were	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
and,	1
seizing	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
alone,	1
began	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
feelings	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
about	1
her	1
sister.	1
With	1
so	1
intellectual	1
a	1
guest	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
be,	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
employ	1
her	1
diplomatic	1
tact.	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
Vera	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
her	1
self-satisfied	1
talk,	1
but	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
seemed	1
embarrassed,	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
rarely	1
happened	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
Vera	1
was	1
saying	1
with	1
an	1
arch	1
smile.	1
"You	1
are	1
so	1
discerning,	1
Prince,	1
and	1
understand	1
people's	1
characters	1
so	1
well	1
at	1
a	1
glance.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
Natalie?	1
Could	1
she	1
be	1
constant	1
in	1
her	1
attachments?	1
Could	1
she,	1
like	1
other	1
women"	1
(Vera	1
meant	1
herself),	1
"love	1
a	1
man	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
and	1
remain	1
true	1
to	1
him	1
forever?	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
consider	1
true	1
love.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Prince?"	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
your	1
sister	1
too	1
little,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
under	1
which	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
embarrassment,	1
"to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
solve	1
so	1
delicate	1
a	1
question,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
have	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
less	1
attractive	1
a	1
woman	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
constant	1
she	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be,"	1
he	1
added,	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
Pierre	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
approaching	1
them.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
Prince.	1
In	1
our	1
days,"	1
continued	1
Vera--mentioning	1
"our	1
days"	1
as	1
people	1
of	1
limited	1
intelligence	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
doing,	1
imagining	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
discovered	1
and	1
appraised	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
"our	1
days"	1
and	1
that	1
human	1
characteristics	1
change	1
with	1
the	1
times--"in	1
our	1
days	1
a	1
girl	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
freedom	1
that	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
courted	1
often	1
stifles	1
real	1
feeling	1
in	1
her.	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
confessed	1
that	1
Natalie	1
is	1
very	1
susceptible."	1
This	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
Natalie	1
caused	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
knit	1
his	1
brows	1
with	1
discomfort:	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
rise,	1
but	1
Vera	1
continued	1
with	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
subtle	1
smile:	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
been	1
more	1
courted	1
than	1
she,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
"but	1
till	1
quite	1
lately	1
she	1
never	1
cared	1
seriously	1
for	1
anyone.	1
Now	1
you	1
know,	1
Count,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
"even	1
our	1
dear	1
cousin	1
Boris,	1
who,	1
between	1
ourselves,	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
gone	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
tenderness..."	1
(alluding	1
to	1
a	1
map	1
of	1
love	1
much	1
in	1
vogue	1
at	1
that	1
time).	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
frowned	1
and	1
remained	1
silent.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
friendly	1
with	1
Boris,	1
aren't	1
you?"	1
asked	1
Vera.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
know	1
him..."	1
	1
"I	1
expect	1
he	1
has	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
his	1
childish	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
there	1
was	1
childish	1
love?"	1
suddenly	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
blushing	1
unexpectedly.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
know	1
between	1
cousins	1
intimacy	1
often	1
leads	1
to	1
love.	1
Le	1
cousinage	1
est	1
un	1
dangereux	1
voisinage.	1
*	1
Don't	1
you	1
think	1
so?"	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Cousinhood	1
is	1
a	1
dangerous	1
neighborhood."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
undoubtedly!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
with	1
sudden	1
and	1
unnatural	1
liveliness	1
he	1
began	1
chaffing	1
Pierre	1
about	1
the	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
careful	1
with	1
his	1
fifty-year-old	1
Moscow	1
cousins,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
these	1
jesting	1
remarks	1
he	1
rose,	1
taking	1
Pierre	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
aside.	1
	1
"Well?"	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
seeing	1
his	1
friend's	1
strange	1
animation	1
with	1
surprise,	1
and	1
noticing	1
the	1
glance	1
he	1
turned	1
on	1
Natasha	1
as	1
he	1
rose.	1
	1
"I	1
must...	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"You	1
know	1
that	1
pair	1
of	1
women's	1
gloves?"	1
(He	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
masonic	1
gloves	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
newly	1
initiated	1
Brother	1
to	1
present	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved.)	1
"I...	1
but	1
no,	1
I	1
will	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
later	1
on,"	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
light	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
restlessness	1
in	1
his	1
movements,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
approached	1
Natasha	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her.	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
how	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
her	1
something	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
flushed	1
as	1
she	1
replied.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Berg	1
came	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
began	1
insisting	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
an	1
argument	1
between	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
the	1
colonel	1
on	1
the	1
affairs	1
in	1
Spain.	1
	1
Berg	1
was	1
satisfied	1
and	1
happy.	1
The	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
never	1
left	1
his	1
face.	1
The	1
party	1
was	1
very	1
successful	1
and	1
quite	1
like	1
other	1
parties	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
Everything	1
was	1
similar:	1
the	1
ladies'	1
subtle	1
talk,	1
the	1
cards,	1
the	1
general	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
card	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
samovar	1
and	1
the	1
tea	1
cakes;	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
was	1
lacking	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
seen	1
at	1
the	1
evening	1
parties	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
imitate.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
a	1
loud	1
conversation	1
among	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
a	1
dispute	1
about	1
something	1
important	1
and	1
clever.	1
Now	1
the	1
general	1
had	1
begun	1
such	1
a	1
discussion	1
and	1
so	1
Berg	1
drew	1
Pierre	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXII	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
having	1
been	1
invited	1
by	1
the	1
count,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
dined	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
there.	1
	1
Everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
realized	1
for	1
whose	1
sake	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came,	1
and	1
without	1
concealing	1
it	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Natasha	1
all	1
day.	1
Not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
frightened	1
yet	1
happy	1
and	1
enraptured	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
house,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
awe	1
at	1
something	1
important	1
that	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
happen.	1
The	1
countess	1
looked	1
with	1
sad	1
and	1
sternly	1
serious	1
eyes	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
when	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
Natasha	1
and	1
timidly	1
started	1
some	1
artificial	1
conversation	1
about	1
trifles	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
her	1
way.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
leave	1
Natasha	1
and	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
them.	1
Natasha	1
grew	1
pale,	1
in	1
a	1
panic	1
of	1
expectation,	1
when	1
she	1
remained	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
surprised	1
her	1
by	1
his	1
timidity.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
evening,	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
left,	1
the	1
countess	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Natasha	1
and	1
whispered:	1
"Well,	1
what?"	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
For	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
don't	1
ask	1
me	1
anything	1
now!	1
One	1
can't	1
talk	1
about	1
that,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
night	1
Natasha,	1
now	1
agitated	1
and	1
now	1
frightened,	1
lay	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
her	1
mother's	1
bed	1
gazing	1
straight	1
before	1
her.	1
She	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
complimented	1
her,	1
how	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
abroad,	1
asked	1
her	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
summer,	1
and	1
then	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
her	1
about	1
Boris.	1
	1
"But	1
such	1
a...	1
such	1
a...	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
before!"	1
she	1
said.	1
"Only	1
I	1
feel	1
afraid	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
afraid	1
when	1
I'm	1
with	1
him.	1
What	1
does	1
that	1
mean?	1
Does	1
it	1
mean	1
that	1
it's	1
the	1
real	1
thing?	1
Yes?	1
Mamma,	1
are	1
you	1
asleep?"	1
	1
"No,	1
my	1
love;	1
I	1
am	1
frightened	1
myself,"	1
answered	1
her	1
mother.	1
"Now	1
go!"	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same	1
I	1
shan't	1
sleep.	1
What	1
silliness,	1
to	1
sleep!	1
Mummy!	1
Mummy!	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
before,"	1
she	1
said,	1
surprised	1
and	1
alarmed	1
at	1
the	1
feeling	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
in	1
herself.	1
"And	1
could	1
we	1
ever	1
have	1
thought!..."	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Natasha	1
that	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
first	1
saw	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
at	1
Otradnoe	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
feared	1
this	1
strange,	1
unexpected	1
happiness	1
of	1
meeting	1
again	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
she	1
had	1
then	1
chosen	1
(she	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
so)	1
and	1
of	1
finding	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
not	1
indifferent	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"And	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
happen	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
specially	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
here.	1
And	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
happen	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
meet	1
at	1
that	1
ball.	1
It	1
is	1
fate.	1
Clearly	1
it	1
is	1
fate	1
that	1
everything	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
this!	1
Already	1
then,	1
directly	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
I	1
felt	1
something	1
peculiar."	1
	1
"What	1
else	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
to	1
you?	1
What	1
are	1
those	1
verses?	1
Read	1
them..."	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
thoughtfully,	1
referring	1
to	1
some	1
verses	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
written	1
in	1
Natasha's	1
album.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
one	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
widower?"	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Natasha!	1
Pray	1
to	1
God.	1
'Marriages	1
are	1
made	1
in	1
heaven,'"	1
said	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
"Darling	1
Mummy,	1
how	1
I	1
love	1
you!	1
How	1
happy	1
I	1
am!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
shedding	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
excitement	1
and	1
embracing	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
very	1
time	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
Pierre	1
and	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha	1
and	1
his	1
firm	1
resolve	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
That	1
day	1
Countess	1
Helene	1
had	1
a	1
reception	1
at	1
her	1
house.	1
The	1
French	1
ambassador	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
a	1
foreign	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
who	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
become	1
a	1
frequent	1
visitor	1
of	1
hers,	1
and	1
many	1
brilliant	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
downstairs,	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
rooms	1
and	1
struck	1
everyone	1
by	1
his	1
preoccupied,	1
absent-minded,	1
and	1
morose	1
air.	1
	1
Since	1
the	1
ball	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
nervous	1
depression	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
desperate	1
efforts	1
to	1
combat	1
it.	1
Since	1
the	1
intimacy	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
the	1
royal	1
prince,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
been	1
made	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
feel	1
oppressed	1
and	1
ashamed	1
in	1
court	1
society,	1
and	1
dark	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
human	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
oftener	1
than	1
before.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
between	1
his	1
protegee	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
accentuated	1
his	1
gloom	1
by	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
his	1
own	1
position	1
and	1
his	1
friend's.	1
He	1
tried	1
equally	1
to	1
avoid	1
thinking	1
about	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
about	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew;	1
and	1
again	1
everything	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
insignificant	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
eternity;	1
again	1
the	1
question:	1
for	1
what?	1
presented	1
itself;	1
and	1
he	1
forced	1
himself	1
to	1
work	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
at	1
masonic	1
labors,	1
hoping	1
to	1
drive	1
away	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
that	1
threatened	1
him.	1
Toward	1
midnight,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
countess'	1
apartments,	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
upstairs	1
in	1
a	1
shabby	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
copying	1
out	1
the	1
original	1
transaction	1
of	1
the	1
Scottish	1
lodge	1
of	1
Freemasons	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
in	1
his	1
low	1
room	1
cloudy	1
with	1
tobacco	1
smoke,	1
when	1
someone	1
came	1
in.	1
It	1
was	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
it's	1
you!"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
preoccupied,	1
dissatisfied	1
air.	1
"And	1
I,	1
you	1
see,	1
am	1
hard	1
at	1
it."	1
He	1
pointed	1
to	1
his	1
manuscript	1
book	1
with	1
that	1
air	1
of	1
escaping	1
from	1
the	1
ills	1
of	1
life	1
with	1
which	1
unhappy	1
people	1
look	1
at	1
their	1
work.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
a	1
beaming,	1
ecstatic	1
expression	1
of	1
renewed	1
life	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
paused	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Pierre	1
and,	1
not	1
noticing	1
his	1
sad	1
look,	1
smiled	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
egotism	1
of	1
joy.	1
	1
"Well,	1
dear	1
heart,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
it	1
yesterday	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
today.	1
I	1
never	1
experienced	1
anything	1
like	1
it	1
before.	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
love,	1
my	1
friend!"	1
	1
Suddenly	1
Pierre	1
heaved	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
and	1
dumped	1
his	1
heavy	1
person	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
beside	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"With	1
Natasha	1
Rostova,	1
yes?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes!	1
Who	1
else	1
should	1
it	1
be?	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
believed	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
feeling	1
is	1
stronger	1
than	1
I.	1
Yesterday	1
I	1
tormented	1
myself	1
and	1
suffered,	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
exchange	1
even	1
that	1
torment	1
for	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
lived	1
till	1
now.	1
At	1
last	1
I	1
live,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
live	1
without	1
her!	1
But	1
can	1
she	1
love	1
me?...	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
old	1
for	1
her....	1
Why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak?"	1
	1
"I?	1
I?	1
What	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
you?"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
suddenly,	1
rising	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
pace	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
"I	1
always	1
thought	1
it....	1
That	1
girl	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
treasure...	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
rare	1
girl....	1
My	1
dear	1
friend,	1
I	1
entreat	1
you,	1
don't	1
philosophize,	1
don't	1
doubt,	1
marry,	1
marry,	1
marry....	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
there	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
happier	1
man	1
than	1
you."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
of	1
her?"	1
	1
"She	1
loves	1
you."	1
	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
rubbish..."	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
smiling	1
and	1
looking	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"She	1
does,	1
I	1
know,"	1
Pierre	1
cried	1
fiercely.	1
	1
"But	1
do	1
listen,"	1
returned	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
holding	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
condition	1
I	1
am	1
in?	1
I	1
must	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
to	1
someone."	1
	1
"Well,	1
go	1
on,	1
go	1
on.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
really	1
changed,	1
his	1
brow	1
became	1
smooth,	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
gladly	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
seemed,	1
and	1
really	1
was,	1
quite	1
a	1
different,	1
quite	1
a	1
new	1
man.	1
Where	1
was	1
his	1
spleen,	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
life,	1
his	1
disillusionment?	1
Pierre	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
speak	1
openly;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
told	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
Now	1
he	1
boldly	1
and	1
lightly	1
made	1
plans	1
for	1
an	1
extended	1
future,	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sacrifice	1
his	1
own	1
happiness	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
caprice,	1
and	1
spoke	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
either	1
make	1
his	1
father	1
consent	1
to	1
this	1
marriage	1
and	1
love	1
her,	1
or	1
would	1
do	1
without	1
his	1
consent;	1
then	1
he	1
marveled	1
at	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
had	1
mastered	1
him	1
as	1
at	1
something	1
strange,	1
apart	1
from	1
and	1
independent	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
anyone	1
who	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
such	1
love,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
in	1
the	1
past.	1
The	1
whole	1
world	1
is	1
now	1
for	1
me	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
halves:	1
one	1
half	1
is	1
she,	1
and	1
there	1
all	1
is	1
joy,	1
hope,	1
light:	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
is	1
everything	1
where	1
she	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
all	1
gloom	1
and	1
darkness...."	1
	1
"Darkness	1
and	1
gloom,"	1
reiterated	1
Pierre:	1
"yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
understand	1
that."	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
help	1
loving	1
the	1
light,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
fault.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
happy!	1
You	1
understand	1
me?	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
glad	1
for	1
my	1
sake."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
Pierre	1
assented,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
with	1
a	1
touched	1
and	1
sad	1
expression	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
The	1
brighter	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
lot	1
appeared	1
to	1
him,	1
the	1
gloomier	1
seemed	1
his	1
own.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXIII	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
needed	1
his	1
father's	1
consent	1
to	1
his	1
marriage,	1
and	1
to	1
obtain	1
this	1
he	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
His	1
father	1
received	1
his	1
son's	1
communication	1
with	1
external	1
composure,	1
but	1
inward	1
wrath.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
comprehend	1
how	1
anyone	1
could	1
wish	1
to	1
alter	1
his	1
life	1
or	1
introduce	1
anything	1
new	1
into	1
it,	1
when	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
was	1
already	1
ending.	1
"If	1
only	1
they	1
would	1
let	1
me	1
end	1
my	1
days	1
as	1
I	1
want	1
to,"	1
thought	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
"then	1
they	1
might	1
do	1
as	1
they	1
please."	1
With	1
his	1
son,	1
however,	1
he	1
employed	1
the	1
diplomacy	1
he	1
reserved	1
for	1
important	1
occasions	1
and,	1
adopting	1
a	1
quiet	1
tone,	1
discussed	1
the	1
whole	1
matter.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
the	1
marriage	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
brilliant	1
one	1
as	1
regards	1
birth,	1
wealth,	1
or	1
rank.	1
Secondly,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
as	1
young	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
his	1
health	1
was	1
poor	1
(the	1
old	1
man	1
laid	1
special	1
stress	1
on	1
this),	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
young.	1
Thirdly,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
son	1
whom	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pity	1
to	1
entrust	1
to	1
a	1
chit	1
of	1
a	1
girl.	1
"Fourthly	1
and	1
finally,"	1
the	1
father	1
said,	1
looking	1
ironically	1
at	1
his	1
son,	1
"I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
for	1
a	1
year:	1
go	1
abroad,	1
take	1
a	1
cure,	1
look	1
out	1
as	1
you	1
wanted	1
to	1
for	1
a	1
German	1
tutor	1
for	1
Prince	1
Nicholas.	1
Then	1
if	1
your	1
love	1
or	1
passion	1
or	1
obstinacy--as	1
you	1
please--is	1
still	1
as	1
great,	1
marry!	1
And	1
that's	1
my	1
last	1
word	1
on	1
it.	1
Mind,	1
the	1
last..."	1
concluded	1
the	1
prince,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
alter	1
his	1
decision.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
hoped	1
that	1
his	1
feelings,	1
or	1
his	1
fiancee's,	1
would	1
not	1
stand	1
a	1
year's	1
test,	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
(the	1
old	1
prince	1
himself)	1
would	1
die	1
before	1
then,	1
and	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
conform	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
wish--to	1
propose,	1
and	1
postpone	1
the	1
wedding	1
for	1
a	1
year.	1
	1
Three	1
weeks	1
after	1
the	1
last	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
after	1
her	1
talk	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
Natasha	1
expected	1
Bolkonski	1
all	1
day,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come.	1
On	1
the	1
second	1
and	1
third	1
day	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
either	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
not	1
knowing	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
father,	1
could	1
not	1
explain	1
his	1
absence	1
to	1
herself.	1
	1
Three	1
weeks	1
passed	1
in	1
this	1
way.	1
Natasha	1
had	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
anywhere	1
and	1
wandered	1
from	1
room	1
to	1
room	1
like	1
a	1
shadow,	1
idle	1
and	1
listless;	1
she	1
wept	1
secretly	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
the	1
evenings.	1
She	1
blushed	1
continually	1
and	1
was	1
irritable.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
everybody	1
knew	1
about	1
her	1
disappointment	1
and	1
was	1
laughing	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
pitying	1
her.	1
Strong	1
as	1
was	1
her	1
inward	1
grief,	1
this	1
wound	1
to	1
her	1
vanity	1
intensified	1
her	1
misery.	1
	1
Once	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
Her	1
tears	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
an	1
offended	1
child	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
being	1
punished.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
began	1
to	1
soothe	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
after	1
first	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
words,	1
suddenly	1
interrupted	1
her:	1
	1
"Leave	1
off,	1
Mamma!	1
I	1
don't	1
think,	1
and	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it!	1
He	1
just	1
came	1
and	1
then	1
left	1
off,	1
left	1
off..."	1
	1
Her	1
voice	1
trembled,	1
and	1
she	1
again	1
nearly	1
cried,	1
but	1
recovered	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
quietly:	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
don't	1
at	1
all	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
married.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him;	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
become	1
quite	1
calm,	1
quite	1
calm."	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
this	1
conversation	1
Natasha	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
dress	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
had	1
the	1
peculiar	1
property	1
of	1
conducing	1
to	1
cheerfulness	1
in	1
the	1
mornings,	1
and	1
that	1
day	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
abandoned	1
since	1
the	1
ball.	1
Having	1
finished	1
her	1
morning	1
tea	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
which	1
she	1
particularly	1
liked	1
for	1
its	1
loud	1
resonance,	1
and	1
began	1
singing	1
her	1
solfeggio.	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
her	1
first	1
exercise	1
she	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
sang	1
a	1
musical	1
phrase	1
that	1
particularly	1
pleased	1
her.	1
She	1
listened	1
joyfully	1
(as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
it)	1
to	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
the	1
notes	1
reverberating,	1
filling	1
the	1
whole	1
empty	1
ballroom,	1
and	1
slowly	1
dying	1
away;	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
felt	1
cheerful.	1
"What's	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
making	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
it?	1
Things	1
are	1
nice	1
as	1
it	1
is,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
not	1
stepping	1
simply	1
on	1
the	1
resounding	1
parquet	1
but	1
treading	1
with	1
each	1
step	1
from	1
the	1
heel	1
to	1
the	1
toe	1
(she	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
favorite	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes)	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
regular	1
tap	1
of	1
the	1
heel	1
and	1
creak	1
of	1
the	1
toe	1
as	1
gladly	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
voice.	1
Passing	1
a	1
mirror	1
she	1
glanced	1
into	1
it.	1
"There,	1
that's	1
me!"	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
as	1
she	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
herself.	1
"Well,	1
and	1
very	1
nice	1
too!	1
I	1
need	1
nobody."	1
	1
A	1
footman	1
wanted	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
clear	1
away	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him,	1
and	1
having	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him	1
continued	1
her	1
walk.	1
That	1
morning	1
she	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
favorite	1
mood--love	1
of,	1
and	1
delight	1
in,	1
herself.	1
"How	1
charming	1
that	1
Natasha	1
is!"	1
she	1
said	1
again,	1
speaking	1
as	1
some	1
third,	1
collective,	1
male	1
person.	1
"Pretty,	1
a	1
good	1
voice,	1
young,	1
and	1
in	1
nobody's	1
way	1
if	1
only	1
they	1
leave	1
her	1
in	1
peace."	1
But	1
however	1
much	1
they	1
left	1
her	1
in	1
peace	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
at	1
peace,	1
and	1
immediately	1
felt	1
this.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
hall	1
the	1
porch	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
someone	1
asked,	1
"At	1
home?"	1
and	1
then	1
footsteps	1
were	1
heard.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
mirror,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
herself.	1
She	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
in	1
the	1
hall.	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
herself,	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
pale.	1
It	1
was	1
he.	1
She	1
knew	1
this	1
for	1
certain,	1
though	1
she	1
hardly	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
through	1
the	1
closed	1
doors.	1
	1
Pale	1
and	1
agitated,	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
Bolkonski	1
has	1
come!"	1
she	1
said.	1
"Mamma,	1
it	1
is	1
awful,	1
it	1
is	1
unbearable!	1
I	1
don't	1
want...	1
to	1
be	1
tormented?	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?..."	1
	1
Before	1
the	1
countess	1
could	1
answer,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
an	1
agitated	1
and	1
serious	1
face.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
Natasha	1
his	1
face	1
brightened.	1
He	1
kissed	1
the	1
countess'	1
hand	1
and	1
Natasha's,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
long	1
since	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure..."	1
began	1
the	1
countess,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
interrupted	1
her	1
by	1
answering	1
her	1
intended	1
question,	1
obviously	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
my	1
father's.	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
talk	1
over	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
matter	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
only	1
got	1
back	1
last	1
night,"	1
he	1
said	1
glancing	1
at	1
Natasha;	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
you,	1
Countess,"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
lowered	1
her	1
eyes,	1
sighing	1
deeply.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
at	1
your	1
disposal,"	1
she	1
murmured.	1
	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
but	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
do	1
so:	1
something	1
gripped	1
her	1
throat,	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
manners	1
she	1
stared	1
straight	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes.	1
	1
"At	1
once?	1
This	1
instant!...	1
No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
Again	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
glance	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken.	1
Yes,	1
at	1
once,	1
that	1
very	1
instant,	1
her	1
fate	1
would	1
be	1
decided.	1
	1
"Go,	1
Natasha!	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
Natasha	1
glanced	1
with	1
frightened	1
imploring	1
eyes	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
come,	1
Countess,	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
your	1
daughter's	1
hand,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
The	1
countess'	1
face	1
flushed	1
hotly,	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
nothing.	1
	1
"Your	1
offer..."	1
she	1
began	1
at	1
last	1
sedately.	1
He	1
remained	1
silent,	1
looking	1
into	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"Your	1
offer..."	1
(she	1
grew	1
confused)	1
"is	1
agreeable	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
I	1
accept	1
your	1
offer.	1
I	1
am	1
glad.	1
And	1
my	1
husband...	1
I	1
hope...	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
depend	1
on	1
her...."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
your	1
consent....	1
Do	1
you	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
the	1
countess.	1
She	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
mixed	1
feeling	1
of	1
estrangement	1
and	1
tenderness	1
pressed	1
her	1
lips	1
to	1
his	1
forehead	1
as	1
he	1
stooped	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hand.	1
She	1
wished	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
son,	1
but	1
felt	1
that	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
stranger	1
and	1
a	1
terrifying	1
man.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
my	1
husband	1
will	1
consent,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
"but	1
your	1
father..."	1
	1
"My	1
father,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
my	1
plans,	1
has	1
made	1
it	1
an	1
express	1
condition	1
of	1
his	1
consent	1
that	1
the	1
wedding	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
for	1
a	1
year.	1
And	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
that,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
Natasha	1
is	1
still	1
young,	1
but--so	1
long	1
as	1
that?..."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
unavoidable,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
send	1
her	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
us!"	1
she	1
repeated	1
while	1
seeking	1
her	1
daughter.	1
	1
Sonya	1
said	1
that	1
Natasha	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
bedroom.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
bed,	1
pale	1
and	1
dry	1
eyed,	1
and	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
icons	1
and	1
whispering	1
something	1
as	1
she	1
rapidly	1
crossed	1
herself.	1
Seeing	1
her	1
mother	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
flew	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Mamma?...	1
Well?..."	1
	1
"Go,	1
go	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
asking	1
for	1
your	1
hand,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
coldly	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
"Go...	1
go,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother,	1
sadly	1
and	1
reproachfully,	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
as	1
her	1
daughter	1
ran	1
away.	1
	1
Natasha	1
never	1
remembered	1
how	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
When	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
saw	1
him	1
she	1
paused.	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
this	1
stranger	1
has	1
now	1
become	1
everything	1
to	1
me?"	1
she	1
asked	1
herself,	1
and	1
immediately	1
answered,	1
"Yes,	1
everything!	1
He	1
alone	1
is	1
now	1
dearer	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
loved	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
moment	1
I	1
saw	1
you.	1
May	1
I	1
hope?"	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
serious	1
impassioned	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face.	1
Her	1
face	1
said:	1
"Why	1
ask?	1
Why	1
doubt	1
what	1
you	1
cannot	1
but	1
know?	1
Why	1
speak,	1
when	1
words	1
cannot	1
express	1
what	1
one	1
feels?"	1
	1
She	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
stopped.	1
He	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
love	1
me?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes!"	1
Natasha	1
murmured	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
vexation.	1
Then	1
she	1
sighed	1
loudly	1
and,	1
catching	1
her	1
breath	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
quickly,	1
began	1
to	1
sob.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
happy!"	1
she	1
replied,	1
smiled	1
through	1
her	1
tears,	1
bent	1
over	1
closer	1
to	1
him,	1
paused	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
herself	1
whether	1
she	1
might,	1
and	1
then	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
held	1
her	1
hands,	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
his	1
former	1
love	1
for	1
her.	1
Something	1
in	1
him	1
had	1
suddenly	1
changed;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
former	1
poetic	1
and	1
mystic	1
charm	1
of	1
desire,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
feminine	1
and	1
childish	1
weakness,	1
fear	1
at	1
her	1
devotion	1
and	1
trustfulness,	1
and	1
an	1
oppressive	1
yet	1
joyful	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
duty	1
that	1
now	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
forever.	1
The	1
present	1
feeling,	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
bright	1
and	1
poetic	1
as	1
the	1
former,	1
was	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
serious.	1
	1
"Did	1
your	1
mother	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
year?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
still	1
looking	1
into	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
I--the	1
'chit	1
of	1
a	1
girl,'	1
as	1
everybody	1
called	1
me,"	1
thought	1
Natasha--"is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
equal	1
of	1
this	1
strange,	1
dear,	1
clever	1
man	1
whom	1
even	1
my	1
father	1
looks	1
up	1
to?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
true?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
playing	1
with	1
life,	1
that	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
grown	1
up,	1
that	1
on	1
me	1
now	1
lies	1
a	1
responsibility	1
for	1
my	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
deed?	1
Yes,	1
but	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
ask	1
me?"	1
	1
"No,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
his	1
question.	1
	1
"Forgive	1
me!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"But	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
young,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
through	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
life.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
for	1
you,	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
yourself."	1
	1
Natasha	1
listened	1
with	1
concentrated	1
attention,	1
trying	1
but	1
failing	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
"Hard	1
as	1
this	1
year	1
which	1
delays	1
my	1
happiness	1
will	1
be,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"it	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
yourself.	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
happy	1
in	1
a	1
year,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
free:	1
our	1
engagement	1
shall	1
remain	1
a	1
secret,	1
and	1
should	1
you	1
find	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
love	1
me,	1
or	1
should	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
love..."	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
an	1
unnatural	1
smile.	1
	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
that?"	1
Natasha	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
"You	1
know	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
you	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
Otradnoe	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
quite	1
convinced	1
that	1
she	1
spoke	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
year	1
you	1
will	1
learn	1
to	1
know	1
yourself...."	1
	1
"A	1
whole	1
year!"	1
Natasha	1
repeated	1
suddenly,	1
only	1
now	1
realizing	1
that	1
the	1
marriage	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
postponed	1
for	1
a	1
year.	1
"But	1
why	1
a	1
year?	1
Why	1
a	1
year?..."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
reasons	1
for	1
this	1
delay.	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
can't	1
it	1
be	1
helped?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
expressed	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
altering	1
that	1
decision.	1
	1
"It's	1
awful!	1
Oh,	1
it's	1
awful!	1
awful!"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
cried,	1
and	1
again	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs.	1
"I	1
shall	1
die,	1
waiting	1
a	1
year:	1
it's	1
impossible,	1
it's	1
awful!"	1
She	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
lover's	1
face	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
commiseration	1
and	1
perplexity.	1
	1
"No,	1
no!	1
I'll	1
do	1
anything!"	1
she	1
said,	1
suddenly	1
checking	1
her	1
tears.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
happy."	1
	1
The	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
betrothed	1
couple	1
their	1
blessing.	1
	1
From	1
that	1
day	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
began	1
to	1
frequent	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
as	1
Natasha's	1
affianced	1
lover.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXIV	1
	1
No	1
betrothal	1
ceremony	1
took	1
place	1
and	1
Natasha's	1
engagement	1
to	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
not	1
announced;	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
insisted	1
on	1
that.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
responsible	1
for	1
the	1
delay	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
whole	1
burden	1
of	1
it;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
his	1
word	1
and	1
bound	1
himself	1
forever,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
bind	1
Natasha	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
perfect	1
freedom.	1
If	1
after	1
six	1
months	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
him	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
full	1
right	1
to	1
reject	1
him.	1
Naturally	1
neither	1
Natasha	1
nor	1
her	1
parents	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
this,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
firm.	1
He	1
came	1
every	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs',	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
behave	1
to	1
Natasha	1
as	1
an	1
affianced	1
lover:	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
use	1
the	1
familiar	1
thou,	1
but	1
said	1
you	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
kissed	1
only	1
her	1
hand.	1
After	1
their	1
engagement,	1
quite	1
different,	1
intimate,	1
and	1
natural	1
relations	1
sprang	1
up	1
between	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
till	1
now.	1
Both	1
liked	1
to	1
recall	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
regarded	1
each	1
other	1
when	1
as	1
yet	1
they	1
were	1
nothing	1
to	1
one	1
another;	1
they	1
felt	1
themselves	1
now	1
quite	1
different	1
beings:	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
artificial,	1
now	1
natural	1
and	1
sincere.	1
At	1
first	1
the	1
family	1
felt	1
some	1
constraint	1
in	1
intercourse	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew;	1
he	1
seemed	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
another	1
world,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Natasha	1
trained	1
the	1
family	1
to	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
him,	1
proudly	1
assuring	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
different,	1
but	1
was	1
really	1
just	1
like	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
they	1
grew	1
accustomed	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
without	1
restraint	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
pursued	1
their	1
usual	1
way	1
of	1
life,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
part.	1
He	1
could	1
talk	1
about	1
rural	1
economy	1
with	1
the	1
count,	1
fashions	1
with	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
about	1
albums	1
and	1
fancywork	1
with	1
Sonya.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
household	1
both	1
among	1
themselves	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
expressed	1
their	1
wonder	1
at	1
how	1
it	1
had	1
all	1
happened,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
evident	1
omens	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
it:	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
coming	1
to	1
Otradnoe	1
and	1
their	1
coming	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
the	1
likeness	1
between	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
which	1
her	1
nurse	1
had	1
noticed	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
visit,	1
and	1
Andrew's	1
encounter	1
with	1
Nicholas	1
in	1
1805,	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
incidents	1
betokening	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
poetic	1
dullness	1
and	1
quiet	1
reigned	1
which	1
always	1
accompanies	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
betrothed	1
couple.	1
Often	1
when	1
all	1
sitting	1
together	1
everyone	1
kept	1
silent.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
others	1
would	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
couple,	1
left	1
alone,	1
still	1
remained	1
silent.	1
They	1
rarely	1
spoke	1
of	1
their	1
future	1
life.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
afraid	1
and	1
ashamed	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it.	1
Natasha	1
shared	1
this	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
all	1
his	1
feelings,	1
which	1
she	1
constantly	1
divined.	1
Once	1
she	1
began	1
questioning	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
son.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
blushed,	1
as	1
he	1
often	1
did	1
now--Natasha	1
particularly	1
liked	1
it	1
in	1
him--and	1
said	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
would	1
not	1
live	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
asked	1
Natasha	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
tone.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
take	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
grandfather,	1
and	1
besides..."	1
	1
"How	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
loved	1
him!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
immediately	1
guessing	1
his	1
thought;	1
"but	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
avoid	1
any	1
pretext	1
for	1
finding	1
fault	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
would	1
come	1
up,	1
kiss	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
ask	1
his	1
advice	1
about	1
Petya's	1
education	1
or	1
Nicholas'	1
service.	1
The	1
old	1
countess	1
sighed	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
them;	1
Sonya	1
was	1
always	1
getting	1
frightened	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
excuses	1
for	1
leaving	1
them	1
alone,	1
even	1
when	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
it.	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
spoke	1
(he	1
could	1
tell	1
a	1
story	1
very	1
well),	1
Natasha	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
pride;	1
when	1
she	1
spoke	1
she	1
noticed	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
joy	1
that	1
he	1
gazed	1
attentively	1
and	1
scrutinizingly	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
asked	1
herself	1
in	1
perplexity:	1
"What	1
does	1
he	1
look	1
for	1
in	1
me?	1
He	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
discover	1
something	1
by	1
looking	1
at	1
me!	1
What	1
if	1
what	1
he	1
seeks	1
in	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
there?"	1
Sometimes	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mad,	1
merry	1
moods	1
characteristic	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
particularly	1
loved	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
laughed.	1
He	1
seldom	1
laughed,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
he	1
abandoned	1
himself	1
entirely	1
to	1
his	1
laughter,	1
and	1
after	1
such	1
a	1
laugh	1
she	1
always	1
felt	1
nearer	1
to	1
him.	1
Natasha	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
completely	1
happy	1
if	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
separation	1
awaiting	1
her	1
and	1
drawing	1
near	1
had	1
not	1
terrified	1
her,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
turn	1
pale	1
and	1
cold.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
his	1
departure	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
once	1
since	1
the	1
ball.	1
Pierre	1
seemed	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
embarrassed.	1
He	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
a	1
little	1
chess	1
table	1
with	1
Sonya,	1
thereby	1
inviting	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
come	1
too.	1
He	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
known	1
Bezukhov	1
a	1
long	1
time?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Do	1
you	1
like	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he's	1
a	1
dear,	1
but	1
very	1
absurd."	1
	1
And	1
as	1
usual	1
when	1
speaking	1
of	1
Pierre,	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
anecdotes	1
of	1
his	1
absent-mindedness,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
even	1
been	1
invented	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
entrusted	1
him	1
with	1
our	1
secret?	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
from	1
childhood.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
gold.	1
I	1
beg	1
you,	1
Natalie,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
said	1
with	1
sudden	1
seriousness--"I	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
and	1
heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
may	1
happen.	1
You	1
may	1
cease	1
to...	1
all	1
right,	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
that.	1
Only	1
this,	1
then:	1
whatever	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
you	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
here..."	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
happen?"	1
	1
"Whatever	1
trouble	1
may	1
come,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
continued,	1
"I	1
beg	1
you,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Sophie,	1
whatever	1
may	1
happen,	1
to	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
alone	1
for	1
advice	1
and	1
help!	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
absent-minded	1
and	1
absurd	1
fellow,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
gold."	1
	1
Neither	1
her	1
father,	1
nor	1
her	1
mother,	1
nor	1
Sonya,	1
nor	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
himself	1
could	1
have	1
foreseen	1
how	1
the	1
separation	1
from	1
her	1
lover	1
would	1
act	1
on	1
Natasha.	1
Flushed	1
and	1
agitated	1
she	1
went	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
all	1
that	1
day,	1
dry-eyed,	1
occupied	1
with	1
most	1
trivial	1
matters	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
understanding	1
what	1
awaited	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
cry	1
when,	1
on	1
taking	1
leave,	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
"Don't	1
go!"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
wonder	1
whether	1
he	1
really	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
stay	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
remembered	1
long	1
afterwards.	1
Nor	1
did	1
she	1
cry	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone;	1
but	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
dry-eyed,	1
taking	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
anything	1
and	1
only	1
saying	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
"Oh,	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
go	1
away?"	1
	1
But	1
a	1
fortnight	1
after	1
his	1
departure,	1
to	1
the	1
surprise	1
of	1
those	1
around	1
her,	1
she	1
recovered	1
from	1
her	1
mental	1
sickness	1
just	1
as	1
suddenly	1
and	1
became	1
her	1
old	1
self	1
again,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
moral	1
physiognomy,	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
gets	1
up	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
illness	1
with	1
a	1
changed	1
expression	1
of	1
face.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXV	1
	1
During	1
that	1
year	1
after	1
his	1
son's	1
departure,	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski's	1
health	1
and	1
temper	1
became	1
much	1
worse.	1
He	1
grew	1
still	1
more	1
irritable,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
who	1
generally	1
bore	1
the	1
brunt	1
of	1
his	1
frequent	1
fits	1
of	1
unprovoked	1
anger.	1
He	1
seemed	1
carefully	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
her	1
tender	1
spots	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
torture	1
her	1
mentally	1
as	1
harshly	1
as	1
possible.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
two	1
passions	1
and	1
consequently	1
two	1
joys--her	1
nephew,	1
little	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
religion--and	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
favorite	1
subjects	1
of	1
the	1
prince's	1
attacks	1
and	1
ridicule.	1
Whatever	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
he	1
would	1
bring	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
superstitiousness	1
of	1
old	1
maids,	1
or	1
the	1
petting	1
and	1
spoiling	1
of	1
children.	1
"You	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
him"--little	1
Nicholas--"into	1
an	1
old	1
maid	1
like	1
yourself!	1
A	1
pity!	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
wants	1
a	1
son	1
and	1
not	1
an	1
old	1
maid,"	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
Or,	1
turning	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
he	1
would	1
ask	1
her	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
presence	1
how	1
she	1
liked	1
our	1
village	1
priests	1
and	1
icons	1
and	1
would	1
joke	1
about	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
continually	1
hurt	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
feelings	1
and	1
tormented	1
her,	1
but	1
it	1
cost	1
her	1
no	1
effort	1
to	1
forgive	1
him.	1
Could	1
he	1
be	1
to	1
blame	1
toward	1
her,	1
or	1
could	1
her	1
father,	1
whom	1
she	1
knew	1
loved	1
her	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
be	1
unjust?	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
justice?	1
The	1
princess	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
proud	1
word	1
"justice."	1
All	1
the	1
complex	1
laws	1
of	1
man	1
centered	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
one	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
law--the	1
law	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
self-sacrifice	1
taught	1
us	1
by	1
Him	1
who	1
lovingly	1
suffered	1
for	1
mankind	1
though	1
He	1
Himself	1
was	1
God.	1
What	1
had	1
she	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
justice	1
or	1
injustice	1
of	1
other	1
people?	1
She	1
had	1
to	1
endure	1
and	1
love,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
did.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
winter	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
gay,	1
gentle,	1
and	1
more	1
affectionate	1
than	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
past.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
his	1
love.	1
Before	1
he	1
left	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
talk	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
about	1
something,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
noticed	1
that	1
before	1
his	1
departure	1
they	1
were	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
wrote	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
dreamed	1
(as	1
all	1
girls	1
dream)	1
of	1
marrying	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
in	1
mourning	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
brother,	1
killed	1
in	1
Turkey.	1
	1
Sorrow,	1
it	1
seems,	1
is	1
our	1
common	1
lot,	1
my	1
dear,	1
tender	1
friend	1
Julie.	1
	1
Your	1
loss	1
is	1
so	1
terrible	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
myself	1
as	1
a	1
special	1
providence	1
of	1
God	1
who,	1
loving	1
you,	1
wishes	1
to	1
try	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
excellent	1
mother.	1
Oh,	1
my	1
friend!	1
Religion,	1
and	1
religion	1
alone,	1
can--I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
comfort	1
us--but	1
save	1
us	1
from	1
despair.	1
Religion	1
alone	1
can	1
explain	1
to	1
us	1
what	1
without	1
its	1
help	1
man	1
cannot	1
comprehend:	1
why,	1
for	1
what	1
cause,	1
kind	1
and	1
noble	1
beings	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
happiness	1
in	1
life--not	1
merely	1
harming	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
others--are	1
called	1
away	1
to	1
God,	1
while	1
cruel,	1
useless,	1
harmful	1
persons,	1
or	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
themselves	1
and	1
to	1
others,	1
are	1
left	1
living.	1
The	1
first	1
death	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
one	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget--that	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
sister-in-law--left	1
that	1
impression	1
on	1
me.	1
Just	1
as	1
you	1
ask	1
destiny	1
why	1
your	1
splendid	1
brother	1
had	1
to	1
die,	1
so	1
I	1
asked	1
why	1
that	1
angel	1
Lise,	1
who	1
not	1
only	1
never	1
wronged	1
anyone,	1
but	1
in	1
whose	1
soul	1
there	1
were	1
never	1
any	1
unkind	1
thoughts,	1
had	1
to	1
die.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
dear	1
friend?	1
Five	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
since	1
then,	1
and	1
already	1
I,	1
with	1
my	1
petty	1
understanding,	1
begin	1
to	1
see	1
clearly	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
that	1
death	1
was	1
but	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
infinite	1
goodness	1
of	1
the	1
Creator,	1
whose	1
every	1
action,	1
though	1
generally	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
us,	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
manifestation	1
of	1
His	1
infinite	1
love	1
for	1
His	1
creatures.	1
Perhaps,	1
I	1
often	1
think,	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
angelically	1
innocent	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
perform	1
all	1
a	1
mother's	1
duties.	1
As	1
a	1
young	1
wife	1
she	1
was	1
irreproachable;	1
perhaps	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
as	1
a	1
mother.	1
As	1
it	1
is,	1
not	1
only	1
has	1
she	1
left	1
us,	1
and	1
particularly	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
the	1
purest	1
regrets	1
and	1
memories,	1
but	1
probably	1
she	1
will	1
there	1
receive	1
a	1
place	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
hope	1
for	1
myself.	1
But	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
alone,	1
that	1
early	1
and	1
terrible	1
death	1
has	1
had	1
the	1
most	1
beneficent	1
influence	1
on	1
me	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
brother	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
grief.	1
Then,	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
our	1
loss,	1
these	1
thoughts	1
could	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
me;	1
I	1
should	1
then	1
have	1
dismissed	1
them	1
with	1
horror,	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
clear	1
and	1
certain.	1
I	1
write	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
you,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
only	1
to	1
convince	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
Gospel	1
truth	1
which	1
has	1
become	1
for	1
me	1
a	1
principle	1
of	1
life:	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
hair	1
of	1
our	1
heads	1
will	1
fall	1
without	1
His	1
will.	1
And	1
His	1
will	1
is	1
governed	1
only	1
by	1
infinite	1
love	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
so	1
whatever	1
befalls	1
us	1
is	1
for	1
our	1
good.	1
	1
You	1
ask	1
whether	1
we	1
shall	1
spend	1
next	1
winter	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
so	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
the	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
Buonaparte!	1
The	1
case	1
is	1
this:	1
my	1
father's	1
health	1
is	1
growing	1
noticeably	1
worse,	1
he	1
cannot	1
stand	1
any	1
contradiction	1
and	1
is	1
becoming	1
irritable.	1
This	1
irritability	1
is,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
chiefly	1
directed	1
to	1
political	1
questions.	1
He	1
cannot	1
endure	1
the	1
notion	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
is	1
negotiating	1
on	1
equal	1
terms	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
sovereigns	1
of	1
Europe	1
and	1
particularly	1
with	1
our	1
own,	1
the	1
grandson	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Catherine!	1
As	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
indifferent	1
to	1
politics,	1
but	1
from	1
my	1
father's	1
remarks	1
and	1
his	1
talks	1
with	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
goes	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
especially	1
about	1
the	1
honors	1
conferred	1
on	1
Buonaparte,	1
who	1
only	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
it	1
seems,	1
is	1
not	1
accepted	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
man,	1
still	1
less	1
as	1
Emperor	1
of	1
France.	1
And	1
my	1
father	1
cannot	1
stand	1
this.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
chiefly	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
political	1
views	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
reluctant	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
Moscow;	1
for	1
he	1
foresees	1
the	1
encounters	1
that	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
expressing	1
his	1
views	1
regardless	1
of	1
anybody.	1
All	1
the	1
benefit	1
he	1
might	1
derive	1
from	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
treatment	1
he	1
would	1
lose	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
disputes	1
about	1
Buonaparte	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
inevitable.	1
In	1
any	1
case	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
decided	1
very	1
shortly.	1
	1
Our	1
family	1
life	1
goes	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
except	1
for	1
my	1
brother	1
Andrew's	1
absence.	1
He,	1
as	1
I	1
wrote	1
you	1
before,	1
has	1
changed	1
very	1
much	1
of	1
late.	1
After	1
his	1
sorrow	1
he	1
only	1
this	1
year	1
quite	1
recovered	1
his	1
spirits.	1
He	1
has	1
again	1
become	1
as	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
him	1
when	1
a	1
child:	1
kind,	1
affectionate,	1
with	1
that	1
heart	1
of	1
gold	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
equal.	1
He	1
has	1
realized,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
over	1
for	1
him.	1
But	1
together	1
with	1
this	1
mental	1
change	1
he	1
has	1
grown	1
physically	1
much	1
weaker.	1
He	1
has	1
become	1
thinner	1
and	1
more	1
nervous.	1
I	1
am	1
anxious	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
glad	1
he	1
is	1
taking	1
this	1
trip	1
abroad	1
which	1
the	1
doctors	1
recommended	1
long	1
ago.	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
cure	1
him.	1
You	1
write	1
that	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
active,	1
cultivated,	1
and	1
capable	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men.	1
Forgive	1
my	1
vanity	1
as	1
a	1
relation,	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
doubted	1
it.	1
The	1
good	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
to	1
everybody	1
here,	1
from	1
his	1
peasants	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gentry,	1
is	1
incalculable.	1
On	1
his	1
arrival	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
received	1
only	1
his	1
due.	1
I	1
always	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
rumors	1
fly	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
especially	1
such	1
false	1
ones	1
as	1
that	1
you	1
write	1
about--I	1
mean	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
my	1
brother's	1
betrothal	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
Rostova.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
my	1
brother	1
will	1
ever	1
marry	1
again,	1
and	1
certainly	1
not	1
her;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
why:	1
first,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
rarely	1
speaks	1
about	1
the	1
wife	1
he	1
has	1
lost,	1
the	1
grief	1
of	1
that	1
loss	1
has	1
gone	1
too	1
deep	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
for	1
him	1
ever	1
to	1
decide	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
successor	1
and	1
our	1
little	1
angel	1
a	1
stepmother.	1
Secondly	1
because,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
know,	1
that	1
girl	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
girl	1
who	1
could	1
please	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
he	1
would	1
choose	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
frankly	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
it.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
running	1
on	1
too	1
long	1
and	1
am	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
second	1
sheet.	1
Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend.	1
May	1
God	1
keep	1
you	1
in	1
His	1
holy	1
and	1
mighty	1
care.	1
My	1
dear	1
friend,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
sends	1
you	1
kisses.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVI	1
	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
received	1
an	1
unexpected	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
Switzerland	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
strange	1
and	1
surprising	1
news.	1
He	1
informed	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
engagement	1
to	1
Natasha	1
Rostova.	1
The	1
whole	1
letter	1
breathed	1
loving	1
rapture	1
for	1
his	1
betrothed	1
and	1
tender	1
and	1
confiding	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
sister.	1
He	1
wrote	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
loved	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
now	1
and	1
that	1
only	1
now	1
did	1
he	1
understand	1
and	1
know	1
what	1
life	1
was.	1
He	1
asked	1
his	1
sister	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
resolve	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
last	1
visited	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
so	1
for	1
fear	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
should	1
ask	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
consent,	1
irritating	1
him	1
and	1
having	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
brunt	1
of	1
his	1
displeasure	1
without	1
attaining	1
her	1
object.	1
"Besides,"	1
he	1
wrote,	1
"the	1
matter	1
was	1
not	1
then	1
so	1
definitely	1
settled	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
now.	1
My	1
father	1
then	1
insisted	1
on	1
a	1
delay	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
now	1
already	1
six	1
months,	1
half	1
of	1
that	1
period,	1
have	1
passed,	1
and	1
my	1
resolution	1
is	1
firmer	1
than	1
ever.	1
If	1
the	1
doctors	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
me	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
spas	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
back	1
in	1
Russia,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
postpone	1
my	1
return	1
for	1
three	1
months.	1
You	1
know	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
relations	1
with	1
Father.	1
I	1
want	1
nothing	1
from	1
him.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
and	1
always	1
shall	1
be	1
independent;	1
but	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
arouse	1
his	1
anger,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
perhaps	1
remain	1
with	1
us	1
such	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
would	1
destroy	1
half	1
my	1
happiness.	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
writing	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
question,	1
and	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
good	1
moment	1
to	1
hand	1
him	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
looks	1
at	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
and	1
whether	1
there	1
is	1
hope	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
consent	1
to	1
reduce	1
the	1
term	1
by	1
four	1
months."	1
	1
After	1
long	1
hesitations,	1
doubts,	1
and	1
prayers,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
gave	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
her	1
father.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
quietly:	1
	1
"Write	1
and	1
tell	1
your	1
brother	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
I	1
am	1
dead....	1
It	1
won't	1
be	1
long--I	1
shall	1
soon	1
set	1
him	1
free."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
her	1
father	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
speak	1
and,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
cried:	1
	1
"Marry,	1
marry,	1
my	1
boy!...	1
A	1
good	1
family!...	1
Clever	1
people,	1
eh?	1
Rich,	1
eh?	1
Yes,	1
a	1
nice	1
stepmother	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
will	1
have!	1
Write	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
marry	1
tomorrow	1
if	1
he	1
likes.	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
little	1
Nicholas'	1
stepmother	1
and	1
I'll	1
marry	1
Bourienne!...	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!	1
He	1
mustn't	1
be	1
without	1
a	1
stepmother	1
either!	1
Only	1
one	1
thing,	1
no	1
more	1
women	1
are	1
wanted	1
in	1
my	1
house--let	1
him	1
marry	1
and	1
live	1
by	1
himself.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
too?"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Go	1
in	1
heaven's	1
name!	1
Go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
frost...	1
the	1
frost...	1
the	1
frost!"	1
	1
After	1
this	1
outburst	1
the	1
prince	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
any	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
matter.	1
But	1
repressed	1
vexation	1
at	1
his	1
son's	1
poor-spirited	1
behavior	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
his	1
treatment	1
of	1
his	1
daughter.	1
To	1
his	1
former	1
pretexts	1
for	1
irony	1
a	1
fresh	1
one	1
was	1
now	1
added--allusions	1
to	1
stepmothers	1
and	1
amiabilities	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
I	1
marry	1
her?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
daughter.	1
"She'll	1
make	1
a	1
splendid	1
princess!"	1
	1
And	1
latterly,	1
to	1
her	1
surprise	1
and	1
bewilderment,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
noticed	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
really	1
associating	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
Frenchwoman.	1
She	1
wrote	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
about	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
his	1
letter,	1
but	1
comforted	1
him	1
with	1
hopes	1
of	1
reconciling	1
their	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
idea.	1
	1
Little	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
education,	1
her	1
brother	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
religion	1
were	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
joys	1
and	1
consolations;	1
but	1
besides	1
that,	1
since	1
everyone	1
must	1
have	1
personal	1
hopes,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
the	1
profoundest	1
depths	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
had	1
a	1
hidden	1
dream	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
supplied	1
the	1
chief	1
consolation	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
This	1
comforting	1
dream	1
and	1
hope	1
were	1
given	1
her	1
by	1
God's	1
folk--	1
the	1
half-witted	1
and	1
other	1
pilgrims	1
who	1
visited	1
her	1
without	1
the	1
prince's	1
knowledge.	1
The	1
longer	1
she	1
lived,	1
the	1
more	1
experience	1
and	1
observation	1
she	1
had	1
of	1
life,	1
the	1
greater	1
was	1
her	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
short-sightedness	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
seek	1
enjoyment	1
and	1
happiness	1
here	1
on	1
earth:	1
toiling,	1
suffering,	1
struggling,	1
and	1
harming	1
one	1
another,	1
to	1
obtain	1
that	1
impossible,	1
visionary,	1
sinful	1
happiness.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
loved	1
his	1
wife,	1
she	1
died,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
enough:	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
bind	1
his	1
happiness	1
to	1
another	1
woman.	1
Her	1
father	1
objected	1
to	1
this	1
because	1
he	1
wanted	1
a	1
more	1
distinguished	1
and	1
wealthier	1
match	1
for	1
Andrew.	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
struggled	1
and	1
suffered	1
and	1
tormented	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
injured	1
their	1
souls,	1
their	1
eternal	1
souls,	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
benefits	1
which	1
endure	1
but	1
for	1
an	1
instant.	1
Not	1
only	1
do	1
we	1
know	1
this	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
earth	1
and	1
told	1
us	1
that	1
this	1
life	1
is	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
probation;	1
yet	1
we	1
cling	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
think	1
to	1
find	1
happiness	1
in	1
it.	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
realizes	1
this?"	1

Princess	1
Mary.	1
"No	1
one	1
except	1
these	1
despised	1
God's	1
folk	1
who,	1
wallet	1
on	1
back,	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
door,	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
prince,	1
not	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
ill-usage	1
by	1
him	1
but	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
causing	1
him	1
to	1
sin.	1
To	1
leave	1
family,	1
home,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
worldly	1
welfare,	1
in	1
order	1
without	1
clinging	1
to	1
anything	1
to	1
wander	1
in	1
hempen	1
rags	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
under	1
an	1
assumed	1
name,	1
doing	1
no	1
one	1
any	1
harm	1
but	1
praying	1
for	1
all--for	1
those	1
who	1
drive	1
one	1
away	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
protect	1
one:	1
higher	1
than	1
that	1
life	1
and	1
truth	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
life	1
or	1
truth!"	1
	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
pilgrim,	1
a	1
quiet	1
pockmarked	1
little	1
woman	1
of	1
fifty	1
called	1
Theodosia,	1
who	1
for	1
over	1
thirty	1
years	1
had	1
gone	1
about	1
barefoot	1
and	1
worn	1
heavy	1
chains.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
particularly	1
fond	1
of	1
her.	1
Once,	1
when	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
lamp	1
dimly	1
lit	1
before	1
the	1
icon	1
Theodosia	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
Theodosia	1
alone	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
true	1
path	1
of	1
life	1
suddenly	1
came	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
she	1
resolved	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
pilgrim	1
herself.	1
When	1
Theodosia	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
sleep	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
thought	1
about	1
this	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
that,	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
seem,	1
she	1
must	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
pilgrimage.	1
She	1
disclosed	1
this	1
thought	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
to	1
her	1
confessor,	1
Father	1
Akinfi,	1
the	1
monk,	1
and	1
he	1
approved	1
of	1
her	1
intention.	1
Under	1
guise	1
of	1
a	1
present	1
for	1
the	1
pilgrims,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
prepared	1
a	1
pilgrim's	1
complete	1
costume	1
for	1
herself:	1
a	1
coarse	1
smock,	1
bast	1
shoes,	1
a	1
rough	1
coat,	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
kerchief.	1
Often,	1
approaching	1
the	1
chest	1
of	1
drawers	1
containing	1
this	1
secret	1
treasure,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
paused,	1
uncertain	1
whether	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
not	1
already	1
come	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
project	1
into	1
execution.	1
	1
Often,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
pilgrims'	1
tales,	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
stimulated	1
by	1
their	1
simple	1
speech,	1
mechanical	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
deep	1
meaning,	1
that	1
several	1
times	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
abandoning	1
everything	1
and	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
home.	1
In	1
imagination	1
she	1
already	1
pictured	1
herself	1
by	1
Theodosia's	1
side,	1
dressed	1
in	1
coarse	1
rags,	1
walking	1
with	1
a	1
staff,	1
a	1
wallet	1
on	1
her	1
back,	1
along	1
the	1
dusty	1
road,	1
directing	1
her	1
wanderings	1
from	1
one	1
saint's	1
shrine	1
to	1
another,	1
free	1
from	1
envy,	1
earthly	1
love,	1
or	1
desire,	1
and	1
reaching	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
sorrow	1
or	1
sighing,	1
but	1
eternal	1
joy	1
and	1
bliss.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
and	1
pray	1
there,	1
and	1
before	1
having	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
or	1
getting	1
to	1
love	1
it,	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
farther.	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
on	1
till	1
my	1
legs	1
fail,	1
and	1
I'll	1
lie	1
down	1
and	1
die	1
somewhere,	1
and	1
shall	1
at	1
last	1
reach	1
that	1
eternal,	1
quiet	1
haven,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
sorrow	1
nor	1
sighing..."	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
But	1
afterwards,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
especially	1
little	1
Koko	1
(Nicholas),	1
her	1
resolve	1
weakened.	1
She	1
wept	1
quietly,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
sinner	1
who	1
loved	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
little	1
nephew	1
more	1
than	1
God.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
The	1
Bible	1
legend	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
labor--idleness--was	1
a	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
man's	1
blessedness	1
before	1
the	1
Fall.	1
Fallen	1
man	1
has	1
retained	1
a	1
love	1
of	1
idleness,	1
but	1
the	1
curse	1
weighs	1
on	1
the	1
race	1
not	1
only	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
seek	1
our	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
sweat	1
of	1
our	1
brows,	1
but	1
because	1
our	1
moral	1
nature	1
is	1
such	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
be	1
both	1
idle	1
and	1
at	1
ease.	1
An	1
inner	1
voice	1
tells	1
us	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
idle.	1
If	1
man	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
though	1
idle	1
he	1
was	1
fulfilling	1
his	1
duty,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
man's	1
primitive	1
blessedness.	1
And	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
obligatory	1
and	1
irreproachable	1
idleness	1
is	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
class--the	1
military.	1
The	1
chief	1
attraction	1
of	1
military	1
service	1
has	1
consisted	1
and	1
will	1
consist	1
in	1
this	1
compulsory	1
and	1
irreproachable	1
idleness.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
experienced	1
this	1
blissful	1
condition	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
when,	1
after	1
1807,	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
serve	1
in	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
already	1
commanded	1
the	1
squadron	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
over	1
from	1
Denisov.	1
	1
Rostov	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
bluff,	1
good-natured	1
fellow,	1
whom	1
his	1
Moscow	1
acquaintances	1
would	1
have	1
considered	1
rather	1
bad	1
form,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
liked	1
and	1
respected	1
by	1
his	1
comrades,	1
subordinates,	1
and	1
superiors,	1
and	1
was	1
well	1
contented	1
with	1
his	1
life.	1
Of	1
late,	1
in	1
1809,	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
letters	1
from	1
home	1
more	1
frequent	1
complaints	1
from	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
their	1
affairs	1
were	1
falling	1
into	1
greater	1
and	1
greater	1
disorder,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
gladden	1
and	1
comfort	1
his	1
old	1
parents.	1
	1
Reading	1
these	1
letters,	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
a	1
dread	1
of	1
their	1
wanting	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
surroundings	1
in	1
which,	1
protected	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
entanglements	1
of	1
life,	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
so	1
calmly	1
and	1
quietly.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
re-enter	1
that	1
whirlpool	1
of	1
life,	1
with	1
its	1
embarrassments	1
and	1
affairs	1
to	1
be	1
straightened	1
out,	1
its	1
accounts	1
with	1
stewards,	1
quarrels,	1
and	1
intrigues,	1
its	1
ties,	1
society,	1
and	1
with	1
Sonya's	1
love	1
and	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
her.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
dreadfully	1
difficult	1
and	1
complicated;	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
in	1
cold,	1
formal	1
letters	1
in	1
French,	1
beginning:	1
"My	1
dear	1
Mamma,"	1
and	1
ending:	1
"Your	1
obedient	1
son,"	1
which	1
said	1
nothing	1
of	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
return.	1
In	1
1810	1
he	1
received	1
letters	1
from	1
his	1
parents,	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
engagement	1
to	1
Bolkonski,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
wedding	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
year's	1
time	1
because	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
made	1
difficulties.	1
This	1
letter	1
grieved	1
and	1
mortified	1
Nicholas.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
that	1
Natasha,	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
cared	1
more	1
than	1
for	1
anyone	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
family,	1
should	1
be	1
lost	1
to	1
the	1
home;	1
and	1
secondly,	1
from	1
his	1
hussar	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
he	1
regretted	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
fellow	1
Bolkonski	1
that	1
connection	1
with	1
him	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
great	1
honor	1
after	1
all,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
loved	1
Natasha	1
he	1
might	1
dispense	1
with	1
permission	1
from	1
his	1
dotard	1
father.	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
hesitated	1
whether	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
apply	1
for	1
leave	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
Natasha	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
married,	1
but	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
maneuvers,	1
and	1
considerations	1
about	1
Sonya	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
confusion	1
of	1
their	1
affairs,	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
again	1
put	1
it	1
off.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
that	1
year,	1
he	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
mother,	1
written	1
without	1
his	1
father's	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
that	1
letter	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
return.	1
She	1
wrote	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
matters	1
in	1
hand,	1
their	1
whole	1
property	1
would	1
be	1
sold	1
by	1
auction	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
all	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
begging.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
so	1
weak,	1
and	1
trusted	1
Mitenka	1
so	1
much,	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
good-natured,	1
that	1
everybody	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
things	1
were	1
going	1
from	1
bad	1
to	1
worse.	1
"For	1
God's	1
sake,	1
I	1
implore	1
you,	1
come	1
at	1
once	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
wretched,"	1
wrote	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
This	1
letter	1
touched	1
Nicholas.	1
He	1
had	1
that	1
common	1
sense	1
of	1
a	1
matter-of-	1
fact	1
man	1
which	1
showed	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
The	1
right	1
thing	1
now	1
was,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
service,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
on	1
leave.	1
Why	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know;	1
but	1
after	1
his	1
after-dinner	1
nap	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
saddle	1
Mars,	1
an	1
extremely	1
vicious	1
gray	1
stallion	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
ridden	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
horse	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
lather,	1
he	1
informed	1
Lavrushka	1
(Denisov's	1
servant	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
with	1
him)	1
and	1
his	1
comrades	1
who	1
turned	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
applying	1
for	1
leave	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
home.	1
Difficult	1
and	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
away	1
without	1
having	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
staff--and	1
this	1
interested	1
him	1
extremely--whether	1
he	1
was	1
promoted	1
to	1
a	1
captaincy	1
or	1
would	1
receive	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
Anne	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
maneuvers;	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
away	1
without	1
having	1
sold	1
his	1
three	1
roans	1
to	1
the	1
Polish	1
Count	1
Golukhovski,	1
who	1
was	1
bargaining	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
Rostov	1
had	1
betted	1
he	1
would	1
sell	1
for	1
two	1
thousand	1
rubles;	1
incomprehensible	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
ball	1
the	1
hussars	1
were	1
giving	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
Polish	1
Mademoiselle	1
Przazdziecka	1
(out	1
of	1
rivalry	1
to	1
the	1
uhlans	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
one	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
their	1
Polish	1
Mademoiselle	1
Borzozowska)	1
would	1
take	1
place	1
without	1
him--he	1
knew	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
away	1
from	1
this	1
good,	1
bright	1
world	1
to	1
somewhere	1
where	1
everything	1
was	1
stupid	1
and	1
confused.	1
A	1
week	1
later	1
he	1
obtained	1
his	1
leave.	1
His	1
hussar	1
comrades--not	1
only	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
regiment,	1
but	1
the	1
whole	1
brigade--gave	1
Rostov	1
a	1
dinner	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
subscription	1
was	1
fifteen	1
rubles	1
a	1
head,	1
and	1
at	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
bands	1
and	1
two	1
choirs	1
of	1
singers.	1
Rostov	1
danced	1
the	1
Trepak	1
with	1
Major	1
Basov;	1
the	1
tipsy	1
officers	1
tossed,	1
embraced,	1
and	1
dropped	1
Rostov;	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
squadron	1
tossed	1
him	1
too,	1
and	1
shouted	1
"hurrah!"	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
sleigh	1
and	1
escorted	1
him	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
post	1
station.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
first	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
journey--from	1
Kremenchug	1
to	1
Kiev--all	1
Rostov's	1
thoughts,	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
such	1
cases,	1
were	1
behind	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
squadron;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
more	1
than	1
halfway	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
forget	1
his	1
three	1
roans	1
and	1
Dozhoyveyko,	1
his	1
quartermaster,	1
and	1
to	1
wonder	1
anxiously	1
how	1
things	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
Otradnoe	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
there.	1
Thoughts	1
of	1
home	1
grew	1
stronger	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
approached	1
it--far	1
stronger,	1
as	1
though	1
this	1
feeling	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
attraction	1
is	1
in	1
inverse	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
square	1
of	1
the	1
distance.	1
At	1
the	1
last	1
post	1
station	1
before	1
Otradnoe	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
driver	1
a	1
three-ruble	1
tip,	1
and	1
on	1
arriving	1
he	1
ran	1
breathlessly,	1
like	1
a	1
boy,	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
his	1
home.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
rapture	1
of	1
meeting,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
odd	1
feeling	1
of	1
unsatisfied	1
expectation--the	1
feeling	1
that	1
"everything	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
same,	1
so	1
why	1
did	1
I	1
hurry?"--Nicholas	1
began	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
home	1
world.	1
His	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
were	1
much	1
the	1
same,	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
older.	1
What	1
was	1
new	1
in	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
uneasiness	1
and	1
occasional	1
discord,	1
which	1
there	1
used	1
not	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
which,	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
soon	1
found	1
out,	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
bad	1
state	1
of	1
their	1
affairs.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
nearly	1
twenty;	1
she	1
had	1
stopped	1
growing	1
prettier	1
and	1
promised	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
was	1
already,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
enough.	1
She	1
exhaled	1
happiness	1
and	1
love	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
Nicholas	1
returned,	1
and	1
the	1
faithful,	1
unalterable	1
love	1
of	1
this	1
girl	1
had	1
a	1
gladdening	1
effect	1
on	1
him.	1
Petya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
surprised	1
Nicholas	1
most.	1
Petya	1
was	1
a	1
big	1
handsome	1
boy	1
of	1
thirteen,	1
merry,	1
witty,	1
and	1
mischievous,	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
was	1
already	1
breaking.	1
As	1
for	1
Natasha,	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
Nicholas	1
wondered	1
and	1
laughed	1
whenever	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
"You're	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
at	1
all,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"How?	1
Am	1
I	1
uglier?"	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
but	1
what	1
dignity?	1
A	1
princess!"	1
he	1
whispered	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
yes!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
joyfully.	1
	1
She	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
her	1
romance	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
Otradnoe	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
his	1
last	1
letter.	1
	1
"Well,	1
are	1
you	1
glad?"	1
Natasha	1
asked.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
tranquil	1
and	1
happy	1
now."	1
	1
"Very	1
glad,"	1
answered	1
Nicholas.	1
"He	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
fellow....	1
And	1
are	1
you	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love?"	1
	1
"How	1
shall	1
I	1
put	1
it?"	1
replied	1
Natasha.	1
"I	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Boris,	1
with	1
my	1
teacher,	1
and	1
with	1
Denisov,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
quite	1
different.	1
I	1
feel	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
settled.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
better	1
man	1
than	1
he	1
exists,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
calm	1
and	1
contented	1
now.	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
before."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
expressed	1
his	1
disapproval	1
of	1
the	1
postponement	1
of	1
the	1
marriage	1
for	1
a	1
year;	1
but	1
Natasha	1
attacked	1
her	1
brother	1
with	1
exasperation,	1
proving	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
thing	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
family	1
against	1
the	1
father's	1
will,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
wished	1
it	1
so.	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
at	1
all	1
understand,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
agreed	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
Her	1
brother	1
often	1
wondered	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
a	1
girl	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
parted	1
from	1
her	1
affianced	1
husband.	1
She	1
was	1
even-	1
tempered	1
and	1
calm	1
and	1
quite	1
as	1
cheerful	1
as	1
of	1
old.	1
This	1
amazed	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
even	1
made	1
him	1
regard	1
Bolkonski's	1
courtship	1
skeptically.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
her	1
fate	1
was	1
sealed,	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
It	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
quite	1
right	1
about	1
this	1
intended	1
marriage.	1
	1
"Why	1
this	1
delay?	1
Why	1
no	1
betrothal?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
Once,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
touched	1
on	1
this	1
topic	1
with	1
his	1
mother,	1
he	1
discovered,	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
and	1
somewhat	1
to	1
his	1
satisfaction,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
doubts	1
about	1
this	1
marriage.	1
	1
"You	1
see	1
he	1
writes,"	1
said	1
she,	1
showing	1
her	1
son	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's,	1
with	1
that	1
latent	1
grudge	1
a	1
mother	1
always	1
has	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
a	1
daughter's	1
future	1
married	1
happiness,	1
"he	1
writes	1
that	1
he	1
won't	1
come	1
before	1
December.	1
What	1
can	1
be	1
keeping	1
him?	1
Illness,	1
probably!	1
His	1
health	1
is	1
very	1
delicate.	1
Don't	1
tell	1
Natasha.	1
And	1
don't	1
attach	1
importance	1
to	1
her	1
being	1
so	1
bright:	1
that's	1
because	1
she's	1
living	1
through	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
girlhood,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
is	1
like	1
every	1
time	1
we	1
receive	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him!	1
However,	1
God	1
grant	1
that	1
everything	1
turns	1
out	1
well!"	1
(She	1
always	1
ended	1
with	1
these	1
words.)	1
"He	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
man!"	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
After	1
reaching	1
home	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
serious	1
and	1
even	1
dull.	1
He	1
was	1
worried	1
by	1
the	1
impending	1
necessity	1
of	1
interfering	1
in	1
the	1
stupid	1
business	1
matters	1
for	1
which	1
his	1
mother	1
had	1
called	1
him	1
home.	1
To	1
throw	1
off	1
this	1
burden	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible,	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
he	1
went,	1
angry	1
and	1
scowling	1
and	1
without	1
answering	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
to	1
Mitenka's	1
lodge	1
and	1
demanded	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
everything.	1
But	1
what	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
everything	1
might	1
be	1
Nicholas	1
knew	1
even	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
frightened	1
and	1
bewildered	1
Mitenka.	1
The	1
conversation	1
and	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
accounts	1
with	1
Mitenka	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long.	1
The	1
village	1
elder,	1
a	1
peasant	1
delegate,	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
clerk,	1
who	1
were	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
heard	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
delight	1
first	1
the	1
young	1
count's	1
voice	1
roaring	1
and	1
snapping	1
and	1
rising	1
louder	1
and	1
louder,	1
and	1
then	1
words	1
of	1
abuse,	1
dreadful	1
words,	1
ejaculated	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"Robber!...	1
Ungrateful	1
wretch!...	1
I'll	1
hack	1
the	1
dog	1
to	1
pieces!	1
I'm	1
not	1
my	1
father!...	1
Robbing	1
us!..."	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
Then	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
fear	1
and	1
delight	1
they	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
young	1
count,	1
red	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
bloodshot	1
eyes,	1
dragged	1
Mitenka	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
scruff	1
of	1
the	1
neck	1
and	1
applied	1
his	1
foot	1
and	1
knee	1
to	1
his	1
behind	1
with	1
great	1
agility	1
at	1
convenient	1
moments	1
between	1
the	1
words,	1
shouting,	1
"Be	1
off!	1
Never	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
your	1
face	1
here	1
again,	1
you	1
villain!"	1
	1
Mitenka	1
flew	1
headlong	1
down	1
the	1
six	1
steps	1
and	1
ran	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
shrubbery.	1
(This	1
shrubbery	1
was	1
a	1
well-known	1
haven	1
of	1
refuge	1
for	1
culprits	1
at	1
Otradnoe.	1
Mitenka	1
himself,	1
returning	1
tipsy	1
from	1
the	1
town,	1
used	1
to	1
hide	1
there,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
residents	1
at	1
Otradnoe,	1
hiding	1
from	1
Mitenka,	1
knew	1
of	1
its	1
protective	1
qualities.)	1
	1
Mitenka's	1
wife	1
and	1
sisters-in-law	1
thrust	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
frightened	1
faces	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
a	1
room	1
where	1
a	1
bright	1
samovar	1
was	1
boiling	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
steward's	1
high	1
bedstead	1
stood	1
with	1
its	1
patchwork	1
quilt.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
count	1
paid	1
no	1
heed	1
to	1
them,	1
but,	1
breathing	1
hard,	1
passed	1
by	1
with	1
resolute	1
strides	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
The	1
countess,	1
who	1
heard	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
the	1
maids	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
at	1
the	1
lodge,	1
was	1
calmed	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
now	1
their	1
affairs	1
would	1
certainly	1
improve,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
felt	1
anxious	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
this	1
excitement	1
might	1
have	1
on	1
her	1
son.	1
She	1
went	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
his	1
door	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
listened,	1
as	1
he	1
lighted	1
one	1
pipe	1
after	1
another.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
called	1
his	1
son	1
aside	1
and,	1
with	1
an	1
embarrassed	1
smile,	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
know,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
it's	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
got	1
excited!	1
Mitenka	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
knew,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
"that	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
understand	1
anything	1
in	1
this	1
crazy	1
world."	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
angry	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
entered	1
those	1
700	1
rubles.	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
carried	1
forward--and	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
page."	1
	1
"Papa,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
blackguard	1
and	1
a	1
thief!	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
is!	1
And	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done,	1
I	1
have	1
done;	1
but,	1
if	1
you	1
like,	1
I	1
won't	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
again."	1
	1
"No,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy"	1
(the	1
count,	1
too,	1
felt	1
embarrassed.	1
He	1
knew	1
he	1
had	1
mismanaged	1
his	1
wife's	1
property	1
and	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
toward	1
his	1
children,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
remedy	1
it).	1
"No,	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
business.	1
I	1
am	1
old.	1
I..."	1
	1
"No,	1
Papa.	1
Forgive	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
you	1
unpleasantness.	1
I	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
less	1
than	1
you	1
do."	1
	1
"Devil	1
take	1
all	1
these	1
peasants,	1
and	1
money	1
matters,	1
and	1
carryings	1
forward	1
from	1
page	1
to	1
page,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"I	1
used	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
a	1
'corner'	1
and	1
the	1
stakes	1
at	1
cards	1
meant,	1
but	1
carrying	1
forward	1
to	1
another	1
page	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
meddle	1
in	1
business	1
affairs.	1
But	1
once	1
the	1
countess	1
called	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
promissory	1
note	1
from	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
for	1
two	1
thousand	1
rubles,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
doing	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
"This,"	1
answered	1
Nicholas.	1
"You	1
say	1
it	1
rests	1
with	1
me.	1
Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
Boris,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
our	1
friends	1
and	1
poor.	1
Well	1
then,	1
this!"	1
and	1
he	1
tore	1
up	1
the	1
note,	1
and	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
caused	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
to	1
weep	1
tears	1
of	1
joy.	1
After	1
that,	1
young	1
Rostov	1
took	1
no	1
further	1
part	1
in	1
any	1
business	1
affairs,	1
but	1
devoted	1
himself	1
with	1
passionate	1
enthusiasm	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
new	1
pursuit--the	1
chase--for	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
kept	1
a	1
large	1
establishment.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
The	1
weather	1
was	1
already	1
growing	1
wintry	1
and	1
morning	1
frosts	1
congealed	1
an	1
earth	1
saturated	1
by	1
autumn	1
rains.	1
The	1
verdure	1
had	1
thickened	1
and	1
its	1
bright	1
green	1
stood	1
out	1
sharply	1
against	1
the	1
brownish	1
strips	1
of	1
winter	1
rye	1
trodden	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
cattle,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
pale-yellow	1
stubble	1
of	1
the	1
spring	1
buckwheat.	1
The	1
wooded	1
ravines	1
and	1
the	1
copses,	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
August	1
had	1
still	1
been	1
green	1
islands	1
amid	1
black	1
fields	1
and	1
stubble,	1
had	1
become	1
golden	1
and	1
bright-red	1
islands	1
amid	1
the	1
green	1
winter	1
rye.	1
The	1
hares	1
had	1
already	1
half	1
changed	1
their	1
summer	1
coats,	1
the	1
fox	1
cubs	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
scatter,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
wolves	1
were	1
bigger	1
than	1
dogs.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
for	1
the	1
chase.	1
The	1
hounds	1
of	1
that	1
ardent	1
young	1
sportsman	1
Rostov	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
reached	1
hard	1
winter	1
condition,	1
but	1
were	1
so	1
jaded	1
that	1
at	1
a	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
huntsmen	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
three	1
days'	1
rest	1
and	1
then,	1
on	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
of	1
September,	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
distant	1
expedition,	1
starting	1
from	1
the	1
oak	1
grove	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
undisturbed	1
litter	1
of	1
wolf	1
cubs.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
hounds	1
remained	1
at	1
home.	1
It	1
was	1
frosty	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
sharp,	1
but	1
toward	1
evening	1
the	1
sky	1
became	1
overcast	1
and	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
thaw.	1
On	1
the	1
fifteenth,	1
when	1
young	1
Rostov,	1
in	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
unsurpassable	1
morning	1
for	1
hunting:	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
sky	1
were	1
melting	1
and	1
sinking	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
without	1
any	1
wind.	1
The	1
only	1
motion	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
dripping,	1
microscopic	1
particles	1
of	1
drizzling	1
mist.	1
The	1
bare	1
twigs	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
were	1
hung	1
with	1
transparent	1
drops	1
which	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
freshly	1
fallen	1
leaves.	1
The	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
garden	1
looked	1
wet	1
and	1
black	1
and	1
glistened	1
like	1
poppy	1
seed	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
merged	1
into	1
the	1
dull,	1
moist	1
veil	1
of	1
mist.	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wet	1
and	1
muddy	1
porch.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
decaying	1
leaves	1
and	1
of	1
dog.	1
Milka,	1
a	1
black-spotted,	1
broad-haunched	1
bitch	1
with	1
prominent	1
black	1
eyes,	1
got	1
up	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
master,	1
stretched	1
her	1
hind	1
legs,	1
lay	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
hare,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
licked	1
him	1
right	1
on	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
mustache.	1
Another	1
borzoi,	1
a	1
dog,	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
path,	1
arched	1
his	1
back	1
and,	1
rushing	1
headlong	1
toward	1
the	1
porch	1
with	1
lifted	1
tail,	1
began	1
rubbing	1
himself	1
against	1
his	1
legs.	1
	1
"O-hoy!"	1
came	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
that	1
inimitable	1
huntsman's	1
call	1
which	1
unites	1
the	1
deepest	1
bass	1
with	1
the	1
shrillest	1
tenor,	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
came	1
Daniel	1
the	1
head	1
huntsman	1
and	1
head	1
kennelman,	1
a	1
gray,	1
wrinkled	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
hair	1
cut	1
straight	1
over	1
his	1
forehead,	1
Ukrainian	1
fashion,	1
a	1
long	1
bent	1
whip	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
that	1
look	1
of	1
independence	1
and	1
scorn	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
seen	1
in	1
huntsmen.	1
He	1
doffed	1
his	1
Circassian	1
cap	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
scornfully.	1
This	1
scorn	1
was	1
not	1
offensive	1
to	1
his	1
master.	1
Nicholas	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
Daniel,	1
disdainful	1
of	1
everybody	1
and	1
who	1
considered	1
himself	1
above	1
them,	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
his	1
serf	1
and	1
huntsman.	1
	1
"Daniel!"	1
Nicholas	1
said	1
timidly,	1
conscious	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
weather,	1
the	1
hounds,	1
and	1
the	1
huntsman	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
that	1
irresistible	1
passion	1
for	1
sport	1
which	1
makes	1
a	1
man	1
forget	1
all	1
his	1
previous	1
resolutions,	1
as	1
a	1
lover	1
forgets	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
mistress.	1
	1
"What	1
orders,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
said	1
the	1
huntsman	1
in	1
his	1
deep	1
bass,	1
deep	1
as	1
a	1
proto-deacon's	1
and	1
hoarse	1
with	1
hallooing--and	1
two	1
flashing	1
black	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
at	1
his	1
master,	1
who	1
was	1
silent.	1
"Can	1
you	1
resist	1
it?"	1
those	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
asking.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
good	1
day,	1
eh?	1
For	1
a	1
hunt	1
and	1
a	1
gallop,	1
eh?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas,	1
scratching	1
Milka	1
behind	1
the	1
ears.	1
	1
Daniel	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
but	1
winked	1
instead.	1
	1
"I	1
sent	1
Uvarka	1
at	1
dawn	1
to	1
listen,"	1
his	1
bass	1
boomed	1
out	1
after	1
a	1
minute's	1
pause.	1
"He	1
says	1
she's	1
moved	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
Otradnoe	1
enclosure.	1
They	1
were	1
howling	1
there."	1
(This	1
meant	1
that	1
the	1
she-wolf,	1
about	1
whom	1
they	1
both	1
knew,	1
had	1
moved	1
with	1
her	1
cubs	1
to	1
the	1
Otradnoe	1
copse,	1
a	1
small	1
place	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
from	1
the	1
house.)	1
	1
"We	1
ought	1
to	1
go,	1
don't	1
you	1
think	1
so?"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"Come	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
Uvarka."	1
	1
"As	1
you	1
please."	1
	1
"Then	1
put	1
off	1
feeding	1
them."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir."	1
	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
Daniel	1
and	1
Uvarka	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
Nicholas'	1
big	1
study.	1
Though	1
Daniel	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
big	1
man,	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
was	1
like	1
seeing	1
a	1
horse	1
or	1
a	1
bear	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
among	1
the	1
furniture	1
and	1
surroundings	1
of	1
human	1
life.	1
Daniel	1
himself	1
felt	1
this,	1
and	1
as	1
usual	1
stood	1
just	1
inside	1
the	1
door,	1
trying	1
to	1
speak	1
softly	1
and	1
not	1
move,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
breaking	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
master's	1
apartment,	1
and	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
say	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
necessary	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
from	1
under	1
that	1
ceiling,	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
under	1
the	1
sky	1
once	1
more.	1
	1
Having	1
finished	1
his	1
inquiries	1
and	1
extorted	1
from	1
Daniel	1
an	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
hounds	1
were	1
fit	1
(Daniel	1
himself	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
hunting),	1
Nicholas	1
ordered	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
saddled.	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
Daniel	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
Natasha	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps,	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
up	1
her	1
hair	1
or	1
finished	1
dressing	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
old	1
nurse's	1
big	1
shawl	1
wrapped	1
round	1
her.	1
Petya	1
ran	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
going?"	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
"I	1
knew	1
you	1
would!	1
Sonya	1
said	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
go,	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
today	1
is	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
day	1
when	1
you	1
couldn't	1
help	1
going."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
are	1
going,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas	1
reluctantly,	1
for	1
today,	1
as	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
hunt	1
seriously,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Petya.	1
"We	1
are	1
going,	1
but	1
only	1
wolf	1
hunting:	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
dull	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
greatest	1
pleasure,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"It's	1
not	1
fair;	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
by	1
yourself,	1
are	1
having	1
the	1
horses	1
saddled	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
us	1
about	1
it."	1
	1
"'No	1
barrier	1
bars	1
a	1
Russian's	1
path'--we'll	1
go!"	1
shouted	1
Petya.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
can't.	1
Mamma	1
said	1
you	1
mustn't,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I'll	1
go.	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
go,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
decisively.	1
"Daniel,	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
saddle	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
Michael	1
must	1
come	1
with	1
my	1
dogs,"	1
she	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
huntsman.	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Daniel	1
irksome	1
and	1
improper	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
impossible.	1
He	1
cast	1
down	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
hurried	1
out	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
business,	1
careful	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
not	1
to	1
inflict	1
any	1
accidental	1
injury	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
lady.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
The	1
old	1
count,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
kept	1
up	1
an	1
enormous	1
hunting	1
establishment	1
but	1
had	1
now	1
handed	1
it	1
all	1
completely	1
over	1
to	1
his	1
son's	1
care,	1
being	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
spirits	1
on	1
this	1
fifteenth	1
of	1
September,	1
prepared	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
In	1
an	1
hour's	1
time	1
the	1
whole	1
hunting	1
party	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
porch.	1
Nicholas,	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
and	1
serious	1
air	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
now	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
attending	1
to	1
trifles,	1
went	1
past	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Petya	1
who	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
something.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
hunt,	1
sent	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
hounds	1
and	1
huntsmen	1
on	1
ahead	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
quarry,	1
mounted	1
his	1
chestnut	1
Donets,	1
and	1
whistling	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
leash	1
of	1
borzois,	1
set	1
off	1
across	1
the	1
threshing	1
ground	1
to	1
a	1
field	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
Otradnoe	1
wood.	1
The	1
old	1
count's	1
horse,	1
a	1
sorrel	1
gelding	1
called	1
Viflyanka,	1
was	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
groom	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
him,	1
while	1
the	1
count	1
himself	1
was	1
to	1
drive	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
trap	1
straight	1
to	1
a	1
spot	1
reserved	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
They	1
were	1
taking	1
fifty-four	1
hounds,	1
with	1
six	1
hunt	1
attendants	1
and	1
whippers-in.	1
Besides	1
the	1
family,	1
there	1
were	1
eight	1
borzoi	1
kennelmen	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
borzois,	1
so	1
that,	1
with	1
the	1
borzois	1
on	1
the	1
leash	1
belonging	1
to	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
there	1
were	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
dogs	1
and	1
twenty	1
horsemen.	1
	1
Each	1
dog	1
knew	1
its	1
master	1
and	1
its	1
call.	1
Each	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
hunt	1
knew	1
his	1
business,	1
his	1
place,	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
fence	1
they	1
all	1
spread	1
out	1
evenly	1
and	1
quietly,	1
without	1
noise	1
or	1
talk,	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
field	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
Otradnoe	1
covert.	1
	1
The	1
horses	1
stepped	1
over	1
the	1
field	1
as	1
over	1
a	1
thick	1
carpet,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
splashing	1
into	1
puddles	1
as	1
they	1
crossed	1
a	1
road.	1
The	1
misty	1
sky	1
still	1
seemed	1
to	1
descend	1
evenly	1
and	1
imperceptibly	1
toward	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
still,	1
warm,	1
and	1
silent.	1
Occasionally	1
the	1
whistle	1
of	1
a	1
huntsman,	1
the	1
snort	1
of	1
a	1
horse,	1
the	1
crack	1
of	1
a	1
whip,	1
or	1
the	1
whine	1
of	1
a	1
straggling	1
hound	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
mile,	1
five	1
more	1
riders	1
with	1
dogs	1
appeared	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mist,	1
approaching	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
In	1
front	1
rode	1
a	1
fresh-looking,	1
handsome	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
gray	1
mustache.	1
	1
"Good	1
morning,	1
Uncle!"	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
drew	1
near.	1
	1
"That's	1
it.	1
Come	1
on!...	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
it,"	1
began	1
"Uncle."	1
(He	1
was	1
a	1
distant	1
relative	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs',	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
small	1
means,	1
and	1
their	1
neighbor.)	1
"I	1
knew	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
resist	1
it	1
and	1
it's	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
you're	1
going.	1
That's	1
it!	1
Come	1
on!"	1
(This	1
was	1
"Uncle's"	1
favorite	1
expression.)	1
"Take	1
the	1
covert	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
my	1
Girchik	1
says	1
the	1
Ilagins	1
are	1
at	1
Korniki	1
with	1
their	1
hounds.	1
That's	1
it.	1
Come	1
on!...	1
They'll	1
take	1
the	1
cubs	1
from	1
under	1
your	1
very	1
nose."	1
	1
"That's	1
where	1
I'm	1
going.	1
Shall	1
we	1
join	1
up	1
our	1
packs?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
The	1
hounds	1
were	1
joined	1
into	1
one	1
pack,	1
and	1
"Uncle"	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
rode	1
on	1
side	1
by	1
side.	1
Natasha,	1
muffled	1
up	1
in	1
shawls	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
hide	1
her	1
eager	1
face	1
and	1
shining	1
eyes,	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
She	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
Petya	1
who	1
always	1
kept	1
close	1
to	1
her,	1
by	1
Michael,	1
a	1
huntsman,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
groom	1
appointed	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
her.	1
Petya,	1
who	1
was	1
laughing,	1
whipped	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
his	1
horse.	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
easily	1
and	1
confidently	1
on	1
her	1
black	1
Arabchik	1
and	1
reined	1
him	1
in	1
without	1
effort	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
hand.	1
	1
"Uncle"	1
looked	1
round	1
disapprovingly	1
at	1
Petya	1
and	1
Natasha.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
combine	1
frivolity	1
with	1
the	1
serious	1
business	1
of	1
hunting.	1
	1
"Good	1
morning,	1
Uncle!	1
We	1
are	1
going	1
too!"	1
shouted	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Good	1
morning,	1
good	1
morning!	1
But	1
don't	1
go	1
overriding	1
the	1
hounds,"	1
said	1
"Uncle"	1
sternly.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
what	1
a	1
fine	1
dog	1
Trunila	1
is!	1
He	1
knew	1
me,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
referring	1
to	1
her	1
favorite	1
hound.	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
Trunila	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
'dog,'	1
but	1
a	1
harrier,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
his	1
sister,	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
feel	1
the	1
distance	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
separate	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
Natasha	1
understood	1
it.	1
	1
"You	1
mustn't	1
think	1
we'll	1
be	1
in	1
anyone's	1
way,	1
Uncle,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"We'll	1
go	1
to	1
our	1
places	1
and	1
won't	1
budge."	1
	1
"A	1
good	1
thing	1
too,	1
little	1
countess,"	1
said	1
"Uncle,"	1
"only	1
mind	1
you	1
don't	1
fall	1
off	1
your	1
horse,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"because--that's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!--you've	1
nothing	1
to	1
hold	1
on	1
to."	1
	1
The	1
oasis	1
of	1
the	1
Otradnoe	1
covert	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
yards	1
off,	1
the	1
huntsmen	1
were	1
already	1
nearing	1
it.	1
Rostov,	1
having	1
finally	1
settled	1
with	1
"Uncle"	1
where	1
they	1
should	1
set	1
on	1
the	1
hounds,	1
and	1
having	1
shown	1
Natasha	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
stand--a	1
spot	1
where	1
nothing	1
could	1
possibly	1
run	1
out--went	1
round	1
above	1
the	1
ravine.	1
	1
"Well,	1
nephew,	1
you're	1
going	1
for	1
a	1
big	1
wolf,"	1
said	1
"Uncle."	1
"Mind	1
and	1
don't	1
let	1
her	1
slip!"	1
	1
"That's	1
as	1
may	1
happen,"	1
answered	1
Rostov.	1
"Karay,	1
here!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
answering	1
"Uncle's"	1
remark	1
by	1
this	1
call	1
to	1
his	1
borzoi.	1
Karay	1
was	1
a	1
shaggy	1
old	1
dog	1
with	1
a	1
hanging	1
jowl,	1
famous	1
for	1
having	1
tackled	1
a	1
big	1
wolf	1
unaided.	1
They	1
all	1
took	1
up	1
their	1
places.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
count,	1
knowing	1
his	1
son's	1
ardor	1
in	1
the	1
hunt,	1
hurried	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
late,	1
and	1
the	1
huntsmen	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
reached	1
their	1
places	1
when	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
cheerful,	1
flushed,	1
and	1
with	1
quivering	1
cheeks,	1
drove	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
black	1
horses	1
over	1
the	1
winter	1
rye	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
reserved	1
for	1
him,	1
where	1
a	1
wolf	1
might	1
come	1
out.	1
Having	1
straightened	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
fastened	1
on	1
his	1
hunting	1
knives	1
and	1
horn,	1
he	1
mounted	1
his	1
good,	1
sleek,	1
well-fed,	1
and	1
comfortable	1
horse,	1
Viflyanka,	1
which	1
was	1
turning	1
gray,	1
like	1
himself.	1
His	1
horses	1
and	1
trap	1
were	1
sent	1
home.	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
though	1
not	1
at	1
heart	1
a	1
keen	1
sportsman,	1
knew	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
the	1
hunt	1
well,	1
and	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
bushy	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
stand,	1
arranged	1
his	1
reins,	1
settled	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
saddle,	1
and,	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ready,	1
looked	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Beside	1
him	1
was	1
Simon	1
Chekmar,	1
his	1
personal	1
attendant,	1
an	1
old	1
horseman	1
now	1
somewhat	1
stiff	1
in	1
the	1
saddle.	1
Chekmar	1
held	1
in	1
leash	1
three	1
formidable	1
wolfhounds,	1
who	1
had,	1
however,	1
grown	1
fat	1
like	1
their	1
master	1
and	1
his	1
horse.	1
Two	1
wise	1
old	1
dogs	1
lay	1
down	1
unleashed.	1
Some	1
hundred	1
paces	1
farther	1
along	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
stood	1
Mitka,	1
the	1
count's	1
other	1
groom,	1
a	1
daring	1
horseman	1
and	1
keen	1
rider	1
to	1
hounds.	1
Before	1
the	1
hunt,	1
by	1
old	1
custom,	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
drunk	1
a	1
silver	1
cupful	1
of	1
mulled	1
brandy,	1
taken	1
a	1
snack,	1
and	1
washed	1
it	1
down	1
with	1
half	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
his	1
favorite	1
Bordeaux.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
somewhat	1
flushed	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
and	1
the	1
drive.	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
rather	1
moist	1
and	1
glittered	1
more	1
than	1
usual,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
saddle,	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
fur	1
coat,	1
he	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
taken	1
out	1
for	1
an	1
outing.	1
	1
The	1
thin,	1
hollow-cheeked	1
Chekmar,	1
having	1
got	1
everything	1
ready,	1
kept	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
master	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
terms	1
for	1
thirty	1
years,	1
and	1
understanding	1
the	1
mood	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
expected	1
a	1
pleasant	1
chat.	1
A	1
third	1
person	1
rode	1
up	1
circumspectly	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
(it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
lesson)	1
and	1
stopped	1
behind	1
the	1
count.	1
This	1
person	1
was	1
a	1
gray-bearded	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
woman's	1
cloak,	1
with	1
a	1
tall	1
peaked	1
cap	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
buffoon,	1
who	1
went	1
by	1
a	1
woman's	1
name,	1
Nastasya	1
Ivanovna.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Nastasya	1
Ivanovna!"	1
whispered	1
the	1
count,	1
winking	1
at	1
him.	1
"If	1
you	1
scare	1
away	1
the	1
beast,	1
Daniel'll	1
give	1
it	1
you!"	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
a	1
thing	1
or	1
two	1
myself!"	1
said	1
Nastasya	1
Ivanovna.	1
	1
"Hush!"	1
whispered	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Simon.	1
"Have	1
you	1
seen	1
the	1
young	1
countess?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Where	1
is	1
she?"	1
	1
"With	1
young	1
Count	1
Peter,	1
by	1
the	1
Zharov	1
rank	1
grass,"	1
answered	1
Simon,	1
smiling.	1
"Though	1
she's	1
a	1
lady,	1
she's	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
hunting."	1
	1
"And	1
you're	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
she	1
rides,	1
Simon,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"She's	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
many	1
a	1
man!"	1
	1
"Of	1
course!	1
It's	1
marvelous.	1
So	1
bold,	1
so	1
easy!"	1
	1
"And	1
Nicholas?	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
By	1
the	1
Lyadov	1
upland,	1
isn't	1
he?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
He	1
knows	1
where	1
to	1
stand.	1
He	1
understands	1
the	1
matter	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
Daniel	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
often	1
quite	1
astounded,"	1
said	1
Simon,	1
well	1
knowing	1
what	1
would	1
please	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
"Rides	1
well,	1
eh?	1
And	1
how	1
well	1
he	1
looks	1
on	1
his	1
horse,	1
eh?"	1
	1
"A	1
perfect	1
picture!	1
How	1
he	1
chased	1
a	1
fox	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rank	1
grass	1
by	1
the	1
Zavarzinsk	1
thicket	1
the	1
other	1
day!	1
Leaped	1
a	1
fearful	1
place;	1
what	1
a	1
sight	1
when	1
they	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
covert...	1
the	1
horse	1
worth	1
a	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
and	1
the	1
rider	1
beyond	1
all	1
price!	1
Yes,	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
search	1
far	1
to	1
find	1
another	1
as	1
smart."	1
	1
"To	1
search	1
far..."	1
repeated	1
the	1
count,	1
evidently	1
sorry	1
Simon	1
had	1
not	1
said	1
more.	1
"To	1
search	1
far,"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
back	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
his	1
snuffbox.	1
	1
"The	1
other	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
Mass	1
in	1
full	1
uniform,	1
Michael	1
Sidorych..."	1
Simon	1
did	1
not	1
finish,	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
still	1
air	1
he	1
had	1
distinctly	1
caught	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
hunt	1
with	1
only	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
hounds	1
giving	1
tongue.	1
He	1
bent	1
down	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
listened,	1
shaking	1
a	1
warning	1
finger	1
at	1
his	1
master.	1
"They	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
the	1
cubs..."	1
he	1
whispered,	1
"straight	1
to	1
the	1
Lyadov	1
uplands."	1
	1
The	1
count,	1
forgetting	1
to	1
smooth	1
out	1
the	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
distance	1
straight	1
before	1
him,	1
down	1
the	1
narrow	1
open	1
space,	1
holding	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
but	1
not	1
taking	1
any.	1
After	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
hounds	1
came	1
the	1
deep	1
tones	1
of	1
the	1
wolf	1
call	1
from	1
Daniel's	1
hunting	1
horn;	1
the	1
pack	1
joined	1
the	1
first	1
three	1
hounds	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
full	1
cry,	1
with	1
that	1
peculiar	1
lift	1
in	1
the	1
note	1
that	1
indicates	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
after	1
a	1
wolf.	1
The	1
whippers-in	1
no	1
longer	1
set	1
on	1
the	1
hounds,	1
but	1
changed	1
to	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
ulyulyu,	1
and	1
above	1
the	1
others	1
rose	1
Daniel's	1
voice,	1
now	1
a	1
deep	1
bass,	1
now	1
piercingly	1
shrill.	1
His	1
voice	1
seemed	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
whole	1
wood	1
and	1
carried	1
far	1
beyond	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
field.	1
	1
After	1
listening	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
in	1
silence,	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
his	1
attendant	1
convinced	1
themselves	1
that	1
the	1
hounds	1
had	1
separated	1
into	1
two	1
packs:	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
pack,	1
eagerly	1
giving	1
tongue,	1
began	1
to	1
die	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
the	1
other	1
pack	1
rushed	1
by	1
the	1
wood	1
past	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
this	1
that	1
Daniel's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
calling	1
ulyulyu.	1
The	1
sounds	1
of	1
both	1
packs	1
mingled	1
and	1
broke	1
apart	1
again,	1
but	1
both	1
were	1
becoming	1
more	1
distant.	1
	1
Simon	1
sighed	1
and	1
stooped	1
to	1
straighten	1
the	1
leash	1
a	1
young	1
borzoi	1
had	1
entangled;	1
the	1
count	1
too	1
sighed	1
and,	1
noticing	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
opened	1
it	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
pinch.	1
"Back!"	1
cried	1
Simon	1
to	1
a	1
borzoi	1
that	1
was	1
pushing	1
forward	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood.	1
The	1
count	1
started	1
and	1
dropped	1
the	1
snuffbox.	1
Nastasya	1
Ivanovna	1
dismounted	1
to	1
pick	1
it	1
up.	1
The	1
count	1
and	1
Simon	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
Then,	1
unexpectedly,	1
as	1
often	1
happens,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
hunt	1
suddenly	1
approached,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
hounds	1
in	1
full	1
cry	1
and	1
Daniel	1
ulyulyuing	1
were	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
turned	1
and	1
saw	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
Mitka	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
starting	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
raising	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
pointing	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
"Look	1
out!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
plainly	1
showing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
fretted	1
to	1
utter	1
that	1
word,	1
and	1
letting	1
the	1
borzois	1
slip	1
he	1
galloped	1
toward	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
and	1
Simon	1
galloped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
saw	1
on	1
their	1
left	1
a	1
wolf	1
which,	1
softly	1
swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
was	1
coming	1
at	1
a	1
quiet	1
lope	1
farther	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
standing.	1
The	1
angry	1
borzois	1
whined	1
and	1
getting	1
free	1
of	1
the	1
leash	1
rushed	1
past	1
the	1
horses'	1
feet	1
at	1
the	1
wolf.	1
	1
The	1
wolf	1
paused,	1
turned	1
its	1
heavy	1
forehead	1
toward	1
the	1
dogs	1
awkwardly,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
suffering	1
from	1
the	1
quinsy,	1
and,	1
still	1
slightly	1
swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
gave	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
leaps	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
swish	1
of	1
its	1
tail	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
the	1
wood.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant,	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
like	1
a	1
wail,	1
first	1
one	1
hound,	1
then	1
another,	1
and	1
then	1
another,	1
sprang	1
helter-skelter	1
from	1
the	1
wood	1
opposite	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
pack	1
rushed	1
across	1
the	1
field	1
toward	1
the	1
very	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
wolf	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
The	1
hazel	1
bushes	1
parted	1
behind	1
the	1
hounds	1
and	1
Daniel's	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
appeared,	1
dark	1
with	1
sweat.	1
On	1
its	1
long	1
back	1
sat	1
Daniel,	1
hunched	1
forward,	1
capless,	1
his	1
disheveled	1
gray	1
hair	1
hanging	1
over	1
his	1
flushed,	1
perspiring	1
face.	1
	1
"Ulyulyulyu!	1
ulyulyu!..."	1
he	1
cried.	1
When	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
his	1
eyes	1
flashed	1
lightning.	1
	1
"Blast	1
you!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
whip	1
threateningly	1
at	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"You've	1
let	1
the	1
wolf	1
go!...	1
What	1
sportsmen!"	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
scorning	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
frightened	1
and	1
shamefaced	1
count,	1
he	1
lashed	1
the	1
heaving	1
flanks	1
of	1
his	1
sweating	1
chestnut	1
gelding	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
anger	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
aroused	1
and	1
flew	1
off	1
after	1
the	1
hounds.	1
The	1
count,	1
like	1
a	1
punished	1
schoolboy,	1
looked	1
round,	1
trying	1
by	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
win	1
Simon's	1
sympathy	1
for	1
his	1
plight.	1
But	1
Simon	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there.	1
He	1
was	1
galloping	1
round	1
by	1
the	1
bushes	1
while	1
the	1
field	1
was	1
coming	1
up	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
all	1
trying	1
to	1
head	1
the	1
wolf,	1
but	1
it	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
before	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
so.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
meanwhile	1
remained	1
at	1
his	1
post,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
wolf.	1
By	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
hunt	1
approached	1
and	1
receded,	1
by	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
dogs	1
whose	1
notes	1
were	1
familiar	1
to	1
him,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
huntsmen	1
approached,	1
receded,	1
and	1
rose,	1
he	1
realized	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
at	1
the	1
copse.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
wolves	1
were	1
there,	1
that	1
the	1
hounds	1
had	1
separated	1
into	1
two	1
packs,	1
that	1
somewhere	1
a	1
wolf	1
was	1
being	1
chased,	1
and	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
gone	1
wrong.	1
He	1
expected	1
the	1
wolf	1
to	1
come	1
his	1
way	1
any	1
moment.	1
He	1
made	1
thousands	1
of	1
different	1
conjectures	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
and	1
from	1
what	1
side	1
the	1
beast	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
set	1
upon	1
it.	1
Hope	1
alternated	1
with	1
despair.	1
Several	1
times	1
he	1
addressed	1
a	1
prayer	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
the	1
wolf	1
should	1
come	1
his	1
way.	1
He	1
prayed	1
with	1
that	1
passionate	1
and	1
shamefaced	1
feeling	1
with	1
which	1
men	1
pray	1
at	1
moments	1
of	1
great	1
excitement	1
arising	1
from	1
trivial	1
causes.	1
"What	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
Thee	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
me?"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
God.	1
"I	1
know	1
Thou	1
art	1
great,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
to	1
ask	1
this	1
of	1
Thee,	1
but	1
for	1
God's	1
sake	1
do	1
let	1
the	1
old	1
wolf	1
come	1
my	1
way	1
and	1
let	1
Karay	1
spring	1
at	1
it--in	1
sight	1
of	1
'Uncle'	1
who	1
is	1
watching	1
from	1
over	1
there-	1
-and	1
seize	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
throat	1
in	1
a	1
death	1
grip!"	1
A	1
thousand	1
times	1
during	1
that	1
half-hour	1
Rostov	1
cast	1
eager	1
and	1
restless	1
glances	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood,	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
scraggy	1
oaks	1
rising	1
above	1
the	1
aspen	1
undergrowth	1
and	1
the	1
gully	1
with	1
its	1
water-worn	1
side	1
and	1
"Uncle's"	1
cap	1
just	1
visible	1
above	1
the	1
bush	1
on	1
his	1
right.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
shan't	1
have	1
such	1
luck,"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
"yet	1
what	1
wouldn't	1
it	1
be	1
worth!	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be!	1
Everywhere,	1
at	1
cards	1
and	1
in	1
war,	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
unlucky."	1
Memories	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
and	1
of	1
Dolokhov	1
flashed	1
rapidly	1
and	1
clearly	1
through	1
his	1
mind.	1
"Only	1
once	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
get	1
an	1
old	1
wolf,	1
I	1
want	1
only	1
that!"	1
thought	1
he,	1
straining	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
and	1
looking	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
slightest	1
variation	1
of	1
note	1
in	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
dogs.	1
	1
Again	1
he	1
looked	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
saw	1
something	1
running	1
toward	1
him	1
across	1
the	1
deserted	1
field.	1
"No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
taking	1
a	1
deep	1
breath,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
does	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
something	1
long	1
hoped	1
for.	1
The	1
height	1
of	1
happiness	1
was	1
reached--and	1
so	1
simply,	1
without	1
warning,	1
or	1
noise,	1
or	1
display,	1
that	1
Rostov	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
doubt	1
for	1
over	1
a	1
second.	1
The	1
wolf	1
ran	1
forward	1
and	1
jumped	1
heavily	1
over	1
a	1
gully	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
her	1
path.	1
She	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
animal	1
with	1
a	1
gray	1
back	1
and	1
big	1
reddish	1
belly.	1
She	1
ran	1
without	1
hurry,	1
evidently	1
feeling	1
sure	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
saw	1
her.	1
Rostov,	1
holding	1
his	1
breath,	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
borzois.	1
They	1
stood	1
or	1
lay	1
not	1
seeing	1
the	1
wolf	1
or	1
understanding	1
the	1
situation.	1
Old	1
Karay	1
had	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
was	1
angrily	1
searching	1
for	1
fleas,	1
baring	1
his	1
yellow	1
teeth	1
and	1
snapping	1
at	1
his	1
hind	1
legs.	1
	1
"Ulyulyulyu!"	1
whispered	1
Rostov,	1
pouting	1
his	1
lips.	1
The	1
borzois	1
jumped	1
up,	1
jerking	1
the	1
rings	1
of	1
the	1
leashes	1
and	1
pricking	1
their	1
ears.	1
Karay	1
finished	1
scratching	1
his	1
hindquarters	1
and,	1
cocking	1
his	1
ears,	1
got	1
up	1
with	1
quivering	1
tail	1
from	1
which	1
tufts	1
of	1
matted	1
hair	1
hung	1
down.	1
	1
"Shall	1
I	1
loose	1
them	1
or	1
not?"	1
Nicholas	1
asked	1
himself	1
as	1
the	1
wolf	1
approached	1
him	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
copse.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
wolf's	1
whole	1
physiognomy	1
changed:	1
she	1
shuddered,	1
seeing	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
probably	1
never	1
seen	1
before--human	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her--and	1
turning	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
toward	1
Rostov,	1
she	1
paused.	1
	1
"Back	1
or	1
forward?	1
Eh,	1
no	1
matter,	1
forward..."	1
the	1
wolf	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
she	1
moved	1
forward	1
without	1
again	1
looking	1
round	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
quiet,	1
long,	1
easy	1
yet	1
resolute	1
lope.	1
	1
"Ulyulyu!"	1
cried	1
Nicholas,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
not	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
accord	1
his	1
good	1
horse	1
darted	1
headlong	1
downhill,	1
leaping	1
over	1
gullies	1
to	1
head	1
off	1
the	1
wolf,	1
and	1
the	1
borzois	1
passed	1
it,	1
running	1
faster	1
still.	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
his	1
own	1
cry	1
nor	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
galloping,	1
nor	1
see	1
the	1
borzois,	1
nor	1
the	1
ground	1
over	1
which	1
he	1
went:	1
he	1
saw	1
only	1
the	1
wolf,	1
who,	1
increasing	1
her	1
speed,	1
bounded	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
along	1
the	1
hollow.	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
view	1
was	1
Milka,	1
with	1
her	1
black	1
markings	1
and	1
powerful	1
quarters,	1
gaining	1
upon	1
the	1
wolf.	1
Nearer	1
and	1
nearer...	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
ahead	1
of	1
it;	1
but	1
the	1
wolf	1
turned	1
its	1
head	1
to	1
face	1
her,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
putting	1
on	1
speed	1
as	1
she	1
usually	1
did	1
Milka	1
suddenly	1
raised	1
her	1
tail	1
and	1
stiffened	1
her	1
forelegs.	1
	1
"Ulyulyulyulyu!"	1
shouted	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
The	1
reddish	1
Lyubim	1
rushed	1
forward	1
from	1
behind	1
Milka,	1
sprang	1
impetuously	1
at	1
the	1
wolf,	1
and	1
seized	1
it	1
by	1
its	1
hindquarters,	1
but	1
immediately	1
jumped	1
aside	1
in	1
terror.	1
The	1
wolf	1
crouched,	1
gnashed	1
her	1
teeth,	1
and	1
again	1
rose	1
and	1
bounded	1
forward,	1
followed	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
feet	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
borzois,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
any	1
closer	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"She'll	1
get	1
away!	1
No,	1
it's	1
impossible!"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
still	1
shouting	1
with	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice.	1
	1
"Karay,	1
ulyulyu!..."	1
he	1
shouted,	1
looking	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
borzoi	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
his	1
only	1
hope.	1
Karay,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
age	1
had	1
left	1
him,	1
stretched	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
and,	1
watching	1
the	1
wolf,	1
galloped	1
heavily	1
aside	1
to	1
intercept	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
quickness	1
of	1
the	1
wolf's	1
lope	1
and	1
the	1
borzoi's	1
slower	1
pace	1
made	1
it	1
plain	1
that	1
Karay	1
had	1
miscalculated.	1
Nicholas	1
could	1
already	1
see	1
not	1
far	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
wood	1
where	1
the	1
wolf	1
would	1
certainly	1
escape	1
should	1
she	1
reach	1
it.	1
But,	1
coming	1
toward	1
him,	1
he	1
saw	1
hounds	1
and	1
a	1
huntsman	1
galloping	1
almost	1
straight	1
at	1
the	1
wolf.	1
There	1
was	1
still	1
hope.	1
A	1
long,	1
yellowish	1
young	1
borzoi,	1
one	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
from	1
another	1
leash,	1
rushed	1
impetuously	1
at	1
the	1
wolf	1
from	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
almost	1
knocked	1
her	1
over.	1
But	1
the	1
wolf	1
jumped	1
up	1
more	1
quickly	1
than	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
expected	1
and,	1
gnashing	1
her	1
teeth,	1
flew	1
at	1
the	1
yellowish	1
borzoi,	1
which,	1
with	1
a	1
piercing	1
yelp,	1
fell	1
with	1
its	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
bleeding	1
from	1
a	1
gash	1
in	1
its	1
side.	1
	1
"Karay?	1
Old	1
fellow!..."	1
wailed	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
Thanks	1
to	1
the	1
delay	1
caused	1
by	1
this	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
wolf's	1
path,	1
the	1
old	1
dog	1
with	1
its	1
felted	1
hair	1
hanging	1
from	1
its	1
thigh	1
was	1
within	1
five	1
paces	1
of	1
it.	1
As	1
if	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
danger,	1
the	1
wolf	1
turned	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
Karay,	1
tucked	1
her	1
tail	1
yet	1
further	1
between	1
her	1
legs,	1
and	1
increased	1
her	1
speed.	1
But	1
here	1
Nicholas	1
only	1
saw	1
that	1
something	1
happened	1
to	1
Karay--the	1
borzoi	1
was	1
suddenly	1
on	1
the	1
wolf,	1
and	1
they	1
rolled	1
together	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
gully	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
That	1
instant,	1
when	1
Nicholas	1
saw	1
the	1
wolf	1
struggling	1
in	1
the	1
gully	1
with	1
the	1
dogs,	1
while	1
from	1
under	1
them	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
her	1
gray	1
hair	1
and	1
outstretched	1
hind	1
leg	1
and	1
her	1
frightened	1
choking	1
head,	1
with	1
her	1
ears	1
laid	1
back	1
(Karay	1
was	1
pinning	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
throat),	1
was	1
the	1
happiest	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
With	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
saddlebow,	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
dismount	1
and	1
stab	1
the	1
wolf,	1
when	1
she	1
suddenly	1
thrust	1
her	1
head	1
up	1
from	1
among	1
that	1
mass	1
of	1
dogs,	1
and	1
then	1
her	1
forepaws	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
gully.	1
She	1
clicked	1
her	1
teeth	1
(Karay	1
no	1
longer	1
had	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
throat),	1
leaped	1
with	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
hind	1
legs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gully,	1
and	1
having	1
disengaged	1
herself	1
from	1
the	1
dogs,	1
with	1
tail	1
tucked	1
in	1
again,	1
went	1
forward.	1
Karay,	1
his	1
hair	1
bristling,	1
and	1
probably	1
bruised	1
or	1
wounded,	1
climbed	1
with	1
difficulty	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gully.	1
	1
"Oh	1
my	1
God!	1
Why?"	1
Nicholas	1
cried	1
in	1
despair.	1
	1
"Uncle's"	1
huntsman	1
was	1
galloping	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
across	1
the	1
wolf's	1
path	1
and	1
his	1
borzois	1
once	1
more	1
stopped	1
the	1
animal's	1
advance.	1
She	1
was	1
again	1
hemmed	1
in.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
attendant,	1
with	1
"Uncle"	1
and	1
his	1
huntsman,	1
were	1
all	1
riding	1
round	1
the	1
wolf,	1
crying	1
"ulyulyu!"	1
shouting	1
and	1
preparing	1
to	1
dismount	1
each	1
moment	1
that	1
the	1
wolf	1
crouched	1
back,	1
and	1
starting	1
forward	1
again	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
shook	1
herself	1
and	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
wood	1
where	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
safe.	1
	1
Already,	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
this	1
chase,	1
Daniel,	1
hearing	1
the	1
ulyulyuing,	1
had	1
rushed	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
wood.	1
He	1
saw	1
Karay	1
seize	1
the	1
wolf,	1
and	1
checked	1
his	1
horse,	1
supposing	1
the	1
affair	1
to	1
be	1
over.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
horsemen	1
did	1
not	1
dismount	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
wolf	1
shook	1
herself	1
and	1
ran	1
for	1
safety,	1
Daniel	1
set	1
his	1
chestnut	1
galloping,	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
wolf	1
but	1
straight	1
toward	1
the	1
wood,	1
just	1
as	1
Karay	1
had	1
run	1
to	1
cut	1
the	1
animal	1
off.	1
As	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
this,	1
he	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
wolf	1
just	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
stopped	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
by	1
"Uncle's"	1
borzois.	1
	1
Daniel	1
galloped	1
up	1
silently,	1
holding	1
a	1
naked	1
dagger	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
and	1
thrashing	1
the	1
laboring	1
sides	1
of	1
his	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
whip	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
flail.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
neither	1
saw	1
nor	1
heard	1
Daniel	1
until	1
the	1
chestnut,	1
breathing	1
heavily,	1
panted	1
past	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
a	1
body	1
and	1
saw	1
Daniel	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
wolf's	1
back	1
among	1
the	1
dogs,	1
trying	1
to	1
seize	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
ears.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
to	1
the	1
dogs,	1
the	1
hunters,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wolf	1
herself	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
now	1
over.	1
The	1
terrified	1
wolf	1
pressed	1
back	1
her	1
ears	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
rise,	1
but	1
the	1
borzois	1
stuck	1
to	1
her.	1
Daniel	1
rose	1
a	1
little,	1
took	1
a	1
step,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
weight,	1
as	1
if	1
lying	1
down	1
to	1
rest,	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
wolf,	1
seizing	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
ears.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
stab	1
her,	1
but	1
Daniel	1
whispered,	1
"Don't!	1
We'll	1
gag	1
her!"	1
and,	1
changing	1
his	1
position,	1
set	1
his	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
wolf's	1
neck.	1
A	1
stick	1
was	1
thrust	1
between	1
her	1
jaws	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
fastened	1
with	1
a	1
leash,	1
as	1
if	1
bridled,	1
her	1
legs	1
were	1
bound	1
together,	1
and	1
Daniel	1
rolled	1
her	1
over	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side.	1
	1
With	1
happy,	1
exhausted	1
faces,	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
old	1
wolf,	1
alive,	1
on	1
a	1
shying	1
and	1
snorting	1
horse	1
and,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
dogs	1
yelping	1
at	1
her,	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
meet.	1
The	1
hounds	1
had	1
killed	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
cubs	1
and	1
the	1
borzois	1
three.	1
The	1
huntsmen	1
assembled	1
with	1
their	1
booty	1
and	1
their	1
stories,	1
and	1
all	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
wolf,	1
which,	1
with	1
her	1
broad-browed	1
head	1
hanging	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
bitten	1
stick	1
between	1
her	1
jaws,	1
gazed	1
with	1
great	1
glassy	1
eyes	1
at	1
this	1
crowd	1
of	1
dogs	1
and	1
men	1
surrounding	1
her.	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
touched,	1
she	1
jerked	1
her	1
bound	1
legs	1
and	1
looked	1
wildly	1
yet	1
simply	1
at	1
everybody.	1
Old	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
also	1
rode	1
up	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
wolf.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
formidable	1
one!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"A	1
formidable	1
one,	1
eh?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Daniel,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
near.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
answered	1
Daniel,	1
quickly	1
doffing	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
remembered	1
the	1
wolf	1
he	1
had	1
let	1
slip	1
and	1
his	1
encounter	1
with	1
Daniel.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
crusty	1
fellow,	1
friend!"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
For	1
sole	1
reply	1
Daniel	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
shy,	1
childlike,	1
meek,	1
and	1
amiable	1
smile.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
went	1
home,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Petya	1
promised	1
to	1
return	1
very	1
soon,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
early	1
the	1
hunt	1
went	1
farther.	1
At	1
midday	1
they	1
put	1
the	1
hounds	1
into	1
a	1
ravine	1
thickly	1
overgrown	1
with	1
young	1
trees.	1
Nicholas	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
fallow	1
field	1
could	1
see	1
all	1
his	1
whips.	1
	1
Facing	1
him	1
lay	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
winter	1
rye,	1
there	1
his	1
own	1
huntsman	1
stood	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
behind	1
a	1
hazel	1
bush.	1
The	1
hounds	1
had	1
scarcely	1
been	1
loosed	1
before	1
Nicholas	1
heard	1
one	1
he	1
knew,	1
Voltorn,	1
giving	1
tongue	1
at	1
intervals;	1
other	1
hounds	1
joined	1
in,	1
now	1
pausing	1
and	1
now	1
again	1
giving	1
tongue.	1
A	1
moment	1
later	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
wooded	1
ravine	1
that	1
a	1
fox	1
had	1
been	1
found,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
pack,	1
joining	1
together,	1
rushed	1
along	1
the	1
ravine	1
toward	1
the	1
ryefield	1
and	1
away	1
from	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
whips	1
in	1
their	1
red	1
caps	1
galloping	1
along	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
ravine,	1
he	1
even	1
saw	1
the	1
hounds,	1
and	1
was	1
expecting	1
a	1
fox	1
to	1
show	1
itself	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
on	1
the	1
ryefield	1
opposite.	1
	1
The	1
huntsman	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
moved	1
and	1
loosed	1
his	1
borzois,	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
saw	1
a	1
queer,	1
short-legged	1
red	1
fox	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
brush	1
going	1
hard	1
across	1
the	1
field.	1
The	1
borzois	1
bore	1
down	1
on	1
it....	1
Now	1
they	1
drew	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
fox	1
which	1
began	1
to	1
dodge	1
between	1
the	1
field	1
in	1
sharper	1
and	1
sharper	1
curves,	1
trailing	1
its	1
brush,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
a	1
strange	1
white	1
borzoi	1
dashed	1
in	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
black	1
one,	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
in	1
confusion;	1
the	1
borzois	1
formed	1
a	1
star-shaped	1
figure,	1
scarcely	1
swaying	1
their	1
bodies	1
and	1
with	1
tails	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
group.	1
Two	1
huntsmen	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dogs;	1
one	1
in	1
a	1
red	1
cap,	1
the	1
other,	1
a	1
stranger,	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
coat.	1
	1
"What's	1
this?"	1
thought	1
Nicholas.	1
"Where's	1
that	1
huntsman	1
from?	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
'Uncle's'	1
man."	1
	1
The	1
huntsmen	1
got	1
the	1
fox,	1
but	1
stayed	1
there	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
without	1
strapping	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
saddle.	1
Their	1
horses,	1
bridled	1
and	1
with	1
high	1
saddles,	1
stood	1
near	1
them	1
and	1
there	1
too	1
the	1
dogs	1
were	1
lying.	1
The	1
huntsmen	1
waved	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
did	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
fox.	1
Then	1
from	1
that	1
spot	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
horn,	1
with	1
the	1
signal	1
agreed	1
on	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
fight.	1
	1
"That's	1
Ilagin's	1
huntsman	1
having	1
a	1
row	1
with	1
our	1
Ivan,"	1
said	1
Nicholas'	1
groom.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
sent	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
call	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Petya	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
rode	1
at	1
a	1
footpace	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
whips	1
were	1
getting	1
the	1
hounds	1
together.	1
Several	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
fight	1
was	1
going	1
on.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
with	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Petya,	1
who	1
had	1
ridden	1
up,	1
stopped	1
near	1
the	1
hounds,	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
would	1
end.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
bushes	1
came	1
the	1
huntsman	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
fighting	1
and	1
rode	1
toward	1
his	1
young	1
master,	1
with	1
the	1
fox	1
tied	1
to	1
his	1
crupper.	1
While	1
still	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
speak	1
respectfully,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
breathless	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
angry.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
was	1
black,	1
but	1
he	1
probably	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
aware	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"What	1
has	1
happened?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"A	1
likely	1
thing,	1
killing	1
a	1
fox	1
our	1
dogs	1
had	1
hunted!	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
gray	1
bitch	1
that	1
caught	1
it!	1
Go	1
to	1
law,	1
indeed!...	1
He	1
snatches	1
at	1
the	1
fox!	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
fox.	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
saddle!	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
this?..."	1
said	1
the	1
huntsman,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
dagger	1
and	1
probably	1
imagining	1
himself	1
still	1
speaking	1
to	1
his	1
foe.	1
	1
Nicholas,	1
not	1
stopping	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
asked	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
Petya	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
enemy's,	1
Ilagin's,	1
hunting	1
party	1
was.	1
	1
The	1
victorious	1
huntsman	1
rode	1
off	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
there,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
inquiring	1
sympathizers,	1
recounted	1
his	1
exploits.	1
	1
The	1
facts	1
were	1
that	1
Ilagin,	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
had	1
a	1
quarrel	1
and	1
were	1
at	1
law,	1
hunted	1
over	1
places	1
that	1
belonged	1
by	1
custom	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
and	1
had	1
now,	1
as	1
if	1
purposely,	1
sent	1
his	1
men	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
woods	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
hunting	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
man	1
snatch	1
a	1
fox	1
their	1
dogs	1
had	1
chased.	1
	1
Nicholas,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
Ilagin,	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
absence	1
of	1
moderation	1
in	1
judgment,	1
hated	1
him	1
cordially	1
from	1
reports	1
of	1
his	1
arbitrariness	1
and	1
violence,	1
and	1
regarded	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
bitterest	1
foe.	1
He	1
rode	1
in	1
angry	1
agitation	1
toward	1
him,	1
firmly	1
grasping	1
his	1
whip	1
and	1
fully	1
prepared	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
most	1
resolute	1
and	1
desperate	1
steps	1
to	1
punish	1
his	1
enemy.	1
	1
Hardly	1
had	1
he	1
passed	1
an	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
before	1
a	1
stout	1
gentleman	1
in	1
a	1
beaver	1
cap	1
came	1
riding	1
toward	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
handsome	1
raven-black	1
horse,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
two	1
hunt	1
servants.	1
	1
Instead	1
of	1
an	1
enemy,	1
Nicholas	1
found	1
in	1
Ilagin	1
a	1
stately	1
and	1
courteous	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
particularly	1
anxious	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
young	1
count's	1
acquaintance.	1
Having	1
ridden	1
up	1
to	1
Nicholas,	1
Ilagin	1
raised	1
his	1
beaver	1
cap	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
much	1
regretted	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
man	1
punished	1
who	1
had	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
seize	1
a	1
fox	1
hunted	1
by	1
someone	1
else's	1
borzois.	1
He	1
hoped	1
to	1
become	1
better	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
draw	1
his	1
covert.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
afraid	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
would	1
do	1
something	1
dreadful,	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
excitement.	1
Seeing	1
the	1
enemies	1
exchanging	1
friendly	1
greetings,	1
she	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
Ilagin	1
lifted	1
his	1
beaver	1
cap	1
still	1
higher	1
to	1
Natasha	1
and	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile,	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
countess	1
resembled	1
Diana	1
in	1
her	1
passion	1
for	1
the	1
chase	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
beauty,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
much.	1
	1
To	1
expiate	1
his	1
huntsman's	1
offense,	1
Ilagin	1
pressed	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
upland	1
of	1
his	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
away	1
which	1
he	1
usually	1
kept	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
which,	1
he	1
said,	1
swarmed	1
with	1
hares.	1
Nicholas	1
agreed,	1
and	1
the	1
hunt,	1
now	1
doubled,	1
moved	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
way	1
to	1
Iligin's	1
upland	1
was	1
across	1
the	1
fields.	1
The	1
hunt	1
servants	1
fell	1
into	1
line.	1
The	1
masters	1
rode	1
together.	1
"Uncle,"	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
Ilagin	1
kept	1
stealthily	1
glancing	1
at	1
one	1
another's	1
dogs,	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
by	1
their	1
companions	1
and	1
searching	1
uneasily	1
for	1
rivals	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
borzois.	1
	1
Rostov	1
was	1
particularly	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
small,	1
pure-bred,	1
red-	1
spotted	1
bitch	1
on	1
Ilagin's	1
leash,	1
slender	1
but	1
with	1
muscles	1
like	1
steel,	1
a	1
delicate	1
muzzle,	1
and	1
prominent	1
black	1
eyes.	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
swiftness	1
of	1
Ilagin's	1
borzois,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
beautiful	1
bitch	1
saw	1
a	1
rival	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
Milka.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
sober	1
conversation	1
begun	1
by	1
Ilagin	1
about	1
the	1
year's	1
harvest,	1
Nicholas	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
red-spotted	1
bitch.	1
	1
"A	1
fine	1
little	1
bitch,	1
that!"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
careless	1
tone.	1
"Is	1
she	1
swift?"	1
	1
"That	1
one?	1
Yes,	1
she's	1
a	1
good	1
dog,	1
gets	1
what	1
she's	1
after,"	1
answered	1
Ilagin	1
indifferently,	1
of	1
the	1
red-spotted	1
bitch	1
Erza,	1
for	1
which,	1
a	1
year	1
before,	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
neighbor	1
three	1
families	1
of	1
house	1
serfs.	1
"So	1
in	1
your	1
parts,	1
too,	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
boast	1
of,	1
Count?"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
continuing	1
the	1
conversation	1
they	1
had	1
begun.	1
And	1
considering	1
it	1
polite	1
to	1
return	1
the	1
young	1
count's	1
compliment,	1
Ilagin	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
borzois	1
and	1
picked	1
out	1
Milka	1
who	1
attracted	1
his	1
attention	1
by	1
her	1
breadth.	1
"That	1
black-spotted	1
one	1
of	1
yours	1
is	1
fine--well	1
shaped!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
she's	1
fast	1
enough,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
thought:	1
"If	1
only	1
a	1
full-grown	1
hare	1
would	1
cross	1
the	1
field	1
now	1
I'd	1
show	1
you	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
borzoi	1
she	1
is,"	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
groom,	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
a	1
ruble	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
found	1
a	1
hare.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
continued	1
Ilagin,	1
"how	1
some	1
sportsmen	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
jealous	1
about	1
game	1
and	1
dogs.	1
For	1
myself,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
Count,	1
I	1
enjoy	1
riding	1
in	1
company	1
such	1
as	1
this...	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
better?"	1
(he	1
again	1
raised	1
his	1
cap	1
to	1
Natasha)	1
"but	1
as	1
for	1
counting	1
skins	1
and	1
what	1
one	1
takes,	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
about	1
that."	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
not!"	1
	1
"Or	1
being	1
upset	1
because	1
someone	1
else's	1
borzoi	1
and	1
not	1
mine	1
catches	1
something.	1
All	1
I	1
care	1
about	1
is	1
to	1
enjoy	1
seeing	1
the	1
chase,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
Count?	1
For	1
I	1
consider	1
that..."	1
	1
"A-tu!"	1
came	1
the	1
long-drawn	1
cry	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
borzoi	1
whippers-in,	1
who	1
had	1
halted.	1
He	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
knoll	1
in	1
the	1
stubble,	1
holding	1
his	1
whip	1
aloft,	1
and	1
again	1
repeated	1
his	1
long-drawn	1
cry,	1
"A-tu!"	1
(This	1
call	1
and	1
the	1
uplifted	1
whip	1
meant	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
sitting	1
hare.)	1
	1
"Ah,	1
he	1
has	1
found	1
one,	1
I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Ilagin	1
carelessly.	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
must	1
ride	1
up....	1
Shall	1
we	1
both	1
course	1
it?"	1
answered	1
Nicholas,	1
seeing	1
in	1
Erza	1
and	1
"Uncle's"	1
red	1
Rugay	1
two	1
rivals	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
had	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
pitting	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
borzois.	1
"And	1
suppose	1
they	1
outdo	1
my	1
Milka	1
at	1
once!"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
with	1
"Uncle"	1
and	1
Ilagin	1
toward	1
the	1
hare.	1
	1
"A	1
full-grown	1
one?"	1
asked	1
Ilagin	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
whip	1
who	1
had	1
sighted	1
the	1
hare--and	1
not	1
without	1
agitation	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
whistled	1
to	1
Erza.	1
	1
"And	1
you,	1
Michael	1
Nikanorovich?"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
"Uncle."	1
	1
The	1
latter	1
was	1
riding	1
with	1
a	1
sullen	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
I	1
join	1
in?	1
Why,	1
you've	1
given	1
a	1
village	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
your	1
borzois!	1
That's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!	1
Yours	1
are	1
worth	1
thousands.	1
Try	1
yours	1
against	1
one	1
another,	1
you	1
two,	1
and	1
I'll	1
look	1
on!"	1
	1
"Rugay,	1
hey,	1
hey!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
"Rugayushka!"	1
he	1
added,	1
involuntarily	1
by	1
this	1
diminutive	1
expressing	1
his	1
affection	1
and	1
the	1
hopes	1
he	1
placed	1
on	1
this	1
red	1
borzoi.	1
Natasha	1
saw	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
agitation	1
the	1
two	1
elderly	1
men	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
conceal,	1
and	1
was	1
herself	1
excited	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
huntsman	1
stood	1
halfway	1
up	1
the	1
knoll	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
whip	1
and	1
the	1
gentlefolk	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
a	1
footpace;	1
the	1
hounds	1
that	1
were	1
far	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
horizon	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
hare,	1
and	1
the	1
whips,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
gentlefolk,	1
also	1
moved	1
away.	1
All	1
were	1
moving	1
slowly	1
and	1
sedately.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
pointing?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas,	1
riding	1
a	1
hundred	1
paces	1
toward	1
the	1
whip	1
who	1
had	1
sighted	1
the	1
hare.	1
	1
But	1
before	1
the	1
whip	1
could	1
reply,	1
the	1
hare,	1
scenting	1
the	1
frost	1
coming	1
next	1
morning,	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
rest	1
and	1
leaped	1
up.	1
The	1
pack	1
on	1
leash	1
rushed	1
downhill	1
in	1
full	1
cry	1
after	1
the	1
hare,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
the	1
borzois	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
on	1
leash	1
darted	1
after	1
the	1
hounds	1
and	1
the	1
hare.	1
All	1
the	1
hunt,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
moving	1
slowly,	1
shouted,	1
"Stop!"	1
calling	1
in	1
the	1
hounds,	1
while	1
the	1
borzoi	1
whips,	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
"A-tu!"	1
galloped	1
across	1
the	1
field	1
setting	1
the	1
borzois	1
on	1
the	1
hare.	1
The	1
tranquil	1
Ilagin,	1
Nicholas,	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
"Uncle"	1
flew,	1
reckless	1
of	1
where	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
went,	1
seeing	1
only	1
the	1
borzois	1
and	1
the	1
hare	1
and	1
fearing	1
only	1
to	1
lose	1
sight	1
even	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
of	1
the	1
chase.	1
The	1
hare	1
they	1
had	1
started	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
and	1
swift	1
one.	1
When	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
run	1
at	1
once,	1
but	1
pricked	1
his	1
ears	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
shouting	1
and	1
trampling	1
that	1
resounded	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
at	1
once.	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
dozen	1
bounds,	1
not	1
very	1
quickly,	1
letting	1
the	1
borzois	1
gain	1
on	1
him,	1
and,	1
finally	1
having	1
chosen	1
his	1
direction	1
and	1
realized	1
his	1
danger,	1
laid	1
back	1
his	1
ears	1
and	1
rushed	1
off	1
headlong.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
stubble,	1
but	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
autumn	1
sowing	1
where	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
soft.	1
The	1
two	1
borzois	1
of	1
the	1
huntsman	1
who	1
had	1
sighted	1
him,	1
having	1
been	1
the	1
nearest,	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
pursue	1
him,	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
far	1
before	1
Ilagin's	1
red-spotted	1
Erza	1
passed	1
them,	1
got	1
within	1
a	1
length,	1
flew	1
at	1
the	1
hare	1
with	1
terrible	1
swiftness	1
aiming	1
at	1
his	1
scut,	1
and,	1
thinking	1
she	1
had	1
seized	1
him,	1
rolled	1
over	1
like	1
a	1
ball.	1
The	1
hare	1
arched	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
bounded	1
off	1
yet	1
more	1
swiftly.	1
From	1
behind	1
Erza	1
rushed	1
the	1
broad-	1
haunched,	1
black-spotted	1
Milka	1
and	1
began	1
rapidly	1
gaining	1
on	1
the	1
hare.	1
	1
"Milashka,	1
dear!"	1
rose	1
Nicholas'	1
triumphant	1
cry.	1
It	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
Milka	1
would	1
immediately	1
pounce	1
on	1
the	1
hare,	1
but	1
she	1
overtook	1
him	1
and	1
flew	1
past.	1
The	1
hare	1
had	1
squatted.	1
Again	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Erza	1
reached	1
him,	1
but	1
when	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
hare's	1
scut	1
paused	1
as	1
if	1
measuring	1
the	1
distance,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
mistake	1
this	1
time	1
but	1
seize	1
his	1
hind	1
leg.	1
	1
"Erza,	1
darling!"	1
Ilagin	1
wailed	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
unlike	1
his	1
own.	1
Erza	1
did	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
his	1
appeal.	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
seized	1
her	1
prey,	1
the	1
hare	1
moved	1
and	1
darted	1
along	1
the	1
balk	1
between	1
the	1
winter	1
rye	1
and	1
the	1
stubble.	1
Again	1
Erza	1
and	1
Milka	1
were	1
abreast,	1
running	1
like	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
carriage	1
horses,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
overtake	1
the	1
hare,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
easier	1
for	1
the	1
hare	1
to	1
run	1
on	1
the	1
balk	1
and	1
the	1
borzois	1
did	1
not	1
overtake	1
him	1
so	1
quickly.	1
	1
"Rugay,	1
Rugayushka!	1
That's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!"	1
came	1
a	1
third	1
voice	1
just	1
then,	1
and	1
"Uncle's"	1
red	1
borzoi,	1
straining	1
and	1
curving	1
its	1
back,	1
caught	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
foremost	1
borzois,	1
pushed	1
ahead	1
of	1
them	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
strain,	1
put	1
on	1
speed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
hare,	1
knocked	1
it	1
off	1
the	1
balk	1
onto	1
the	1
ryefield,	1
again	1
put	1
on	1
speed	1
still	1
more	1
viciously,	1
sinking	1
to	1
his	1
knees	1
in	1
the	1
muddy	1
field,	1
and	1
all	1
one	1
could	1
see	1
was	1
how,	1
muddying	1
his	1
back,	1
he	1
rolled	1
over	1
with	1
the	1
hare.	1
A	1
ring	1
of	1
borzois	1
surrounded	1
him.	1
A	1
moment	1
later	1
everyone	1
had	1
drawn	1
up	1
round	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
dogs.	1
Only	1
the	1
delighted	1
"Uncle"	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
a	1
pad,	1
shaking	1
the	1
hare	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
to	1
drip	1
off,	1
and	1
anxiously	1
glancing	1
round	1
with	1
restless	1
eyes	1
while	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
twitched.	1
He	1
spoke	1
without	1
himself	1
knowing	1
whom	1
to	1
or	1
what	1
about.	1
"That's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!	1
That's	1
a	1
dog!...	1
There,	1
it	1
has	1
beaten	1
them	1
all,	1
the	1
thousand-ruble	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
one-ruble	1
borzois.	1
That's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!"	1
said	1
he,	1
panting	1
and	1
looking	1
wrathfully	1
around	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
abusing	1
someone,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
his	1
enemies	1
and	1
had	1
insulted	1
him,	1
and	1
only	1
now	1
had	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
in	1
justifying	1
himself.	1
"There	1
are	1
your	1
thousand-ruble	1
ones....	1
That's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!..."	1
	1
"Rugay,	1
here's	1
a	1
pad	1
for	1
you!"	1
he	1
said,	1
throwing	1
down	1
the	1
hare's	1
muddy	1
pad.	1
"You've	1
deserved	1
it,	1
that's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!"	1
	1
"She'd	1
tired	1
herself	1
out,	1
she'd	1
run	1
it	1
down	1
three	1
times	1
by	1
herself,"	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
also	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
whether	1
he	1
were	1
heard	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
running	1
across	1
it	1
like	1
that?"	1
said	1
Ilagin's	1
groom.	1
	1
"Once	1
she	1
had	1
missed	1
it	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
away,	1
any	1
mongrel	1
could	1
take	1
it,"	1
Ilagin	1
was	1
saying	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
breathless	1
from	1
his	1
gallop	1
and	1
his	1
excitement.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
Natasha,	1
without	1
drawing	1
breath,	1
screamed	1
joyously,	1
ecstatically,	1
and	1
so	1
piercingly	1
that	1
it	1
set	1
everyone's	1
ear	1
tingling.	1
By	1
that	1
shriek	1
she	1
expressed	1
what	1
the	1
others	1
expressed	1
by	1
all	1
talking	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
herself	1
have	1
been	1
ashamed	1
of	1
so	1
wild	1
a	1
cry	1
and	1
everyone	1
else	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
amazed	1
at	1
it	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
time.	1
"Uncle"	1
himself	1
twisted	1
up	1
the	1
hare,	1
threw	1
it	1
neatly	1
and	1
smartly	1
across	1
his	1
horse's	1
back	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
that	1
gesture	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
rebuke	1
everybody,	1
and,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
anyone,	1
mounted	1
his	1
bay	1
and	1
rode	1
off.	1
The	1
others	1
all	1
followed,	1
dispirited	1
and	1
shamefaced,	1
and	1
only	1
much	1
later	1
were	1
they	1
able	1
to	1
regain	1
their	1
former	1
affectation	1
of	1
indifference.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
they	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
red	1
Rugay	1
who,	1
his	1
arched	1
back	1
spattered	1
with	1
mud	1
and	1
clanking	1
the	1
ring	1
of	1
his	1
leash,	1
walked	1
along	1
just	1
behind	1
"Uncle's"	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
serene	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
conqueror.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
any	1
other	1
dog	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it's	1
not	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
coursing.	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
is,	1
then	1
look	1
out!"	1
his	1
appearance	1
seemed	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
be	1
saying.	1
	1
When,	1
much	1
later,	1
"Uncle"	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
felt	1
flattered	1
that,	1
after	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
"Uncle"	1
deigned	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Toward	1
evening	1
Ilagin	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
home	1
that	1
he	1
accepted	1
"Uncle's"	1
offer	1
that	1
the	1
hunting	1
party	1
should	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
his	1
little	1
village	1
of	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
	1
"And	1
if	1
you	1
put	1
up	1
at	1
my	1
house	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
still.	1
That's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!"	1
said	1
"Uncle."	1
"You	1
see	1
it's	1
damp	1
weather,	1
and	1
you	1
could	1
rest,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
countess	1
could	1
be	1
driven	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
trap."	1
	1
"Uncle's"	1
offer	1
was	1
accepted.	1
A	1
huntsman	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
Otradnoe	1
for	1
a	1
trap,	1
while	1
Nicholas	1
rode	1
with	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Petya	1
to	1
"Uncle's"	1
house.	1
	1
Some	1
five	1
male	1
domestic	1
serfs,	1
big	1
and	1
little,	1
rushed	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
porch	1
to	1
meet	1
their	1
master.	1
A	1
score	1
of	1
women	1
serfs,	1
old	1
and	1
young,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
children,	1
popped	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
back	1
entrance	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
hunters	1
who	1
were	1
arriving.	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
Natasha--a	1
woman,	1
a	1
lady,	1
and	1
on	1
horseback--raised	1
the	1
curiosity	1
of	1
the	1
serfs	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
stared	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
face,	1
and	1
unabashed	1
by	1
her	1
presence	1
made	1
remarks	1
about	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
some	1
prodigy	1
on	1
show	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
hear	1
or	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
about	1
her.	1
	1
"Arinka!	1
Look,	1
she	1
sits	1
sideways!	1
There	1
she	1
sits	1
and	1
her	1
skirt	1
dangles....	1
See,	1
she's	1
got	1
a	1
little	1
hunting	1
horn!"	1
	1
"Goodness	1
gracious!	1
See	1
her	1
knife?..."	1
	1
"Isn't	1
she	1
a	1
Tartar!"	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
didn't	1
go	1
head	1
over	1
heels?"	1
asked	1
the	1
boldest	1
of	1
all,	1
addressing	1
Natasha	1
directly.	1
	1
"Uncle"	1
dismounted	1
at	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
wooden	1
house	1
which	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
an	1
overgrown	1
garden	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
his	1
retainers,	1
shouted	1
authoritatively	1
that	1
the	1
superfluous	1
ones	1
should	1
take	1
themselves	1
off	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
necessary	1
preparations	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
guests	1
and	1
the	1
visitors.	1
	1
The	1
serfs	1
all	1
dispersed.	1
"Uncle"	1
lifted	1
Natasha	1
off	1
her	1
horse	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
led	1
her	1
up	1
the	1
rickety	1
wooden	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
porch.	1
The	1
house,	1
with	1
its	1
bare,	1
unplastered	1
log	1
walls,	1
was	1
not	1
overclean--it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
that	1
those	1
living	1
in	1
it	1
aimed	1
at	1
keeping	1
it	1
spotless--but	1
neither	1
was	1
it	1
noticeably	1
neglected.	1
In	1
the	1
entry	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
fresh	1
apples,	1
and	1
wolf	1
and	1
fox	1
skins	1
hung	1
about.	1
	1
"Uncle"	1
led	1
the	1
visitors	1
through	1
the	1
anteroom	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
hall	1
with	1
a	1
folding	1
table	1
and	1
red	1
chairs,	1
then	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
round	1
birchwood	1
table	1
and	1
a	1
sofa,	1
and	1
finally	1
into	1
his	1
private	1
room	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tattered	1
sofa,	1
a	1
worn	1
carpet,	1
and	1
portraits	1
of	1
Suvorov,	1
of	1
the	1
host's	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
of	1
himself	1
in	1
military	1
uniform.	1
The	1
study	1
smelt	1
strongly	1
of	1
tobacco	1
and	1
dogs.	1
"Uncle"	1
asked	1
his	1
visitors	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
make	1
themselves	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Rugay,	1
his	1
back	1
still	1
muddy,	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
cleaning	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
tongue	1
and	1
teeth.	1
Leading	1
from	1
the	1
study	1
was	1
a	1
passage	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
partition	1
with	1
ragged	1
curtains	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
From	1
behind	1
this	1
came	1
women's	1
laughter	1
and	1
whispers.	1
Natasha,	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
Petya	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
wraps	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
Petya,	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbow,	1
fell	1
asleep	1
at	1
once.	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
were	1
silent.	1
Their	1
faces	1
glowed,	1
they	1
were	1
hungry	1
and	1
very	1
cheerful.	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
(now	1
that	1
the	1
hunt	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
Nicholas	1
no	1
longer	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
manly	1
superiority	1
over	1
his	1
sister),	1
Natasha	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
wink,	1
and	1
neither	1
refrained	1
long	1
from	1
bursting	1
into	1
a	1
peal	1
of	1
ringing	1
laughter	1
even	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
pretext	1
ready	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
"Uncle"	1
came	1
in,	1
in	1
a	1
Cossack	1
coat,	1
blue	1
trousers,	1
and	1
small	1
top	1
boots.	1
And	1
Natasha	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
costume,	1
the	1
very	1
one	1
she	1
had	1
regarded	1
with	1
surprise	1
and	1
amusement	1
at	1
Otradnoe,	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
worse	1
than	1
a	1
swallow-tail	1
or	1
frock	1
coat.	1
"Uncle"	1
too	1
was	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
offended	1
by	1
the	1
brother's	1
and	1
sister's	1
laughter	1
(it	1
could	1
never	1
enter	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
laughing	1
at	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
life)	1
he	1
himself	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
merriment.	1
	1
"That's	1
right,	1
young	1
countess,	1
that's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
anyone	1
like	1
her!"	1
said	1
he,	1
offering	1
Nicholas	1
a	1
pipe	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
stem	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
practiced	1
motion	1
of	1
three	1
fingers,	1
taking	1
down	1
another	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
short.	1
"She's	1
ridden	1
all	1
day	1
like	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
is	1
as	1
fresh	1
as	1
ever!"	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
"Uncle's"	1
reappearance	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
opened,	1
evidently	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
by	1
a	1
barefooted	1
girl,	1
and	1
a	1
stout,	1
rosy,	1
good-looking	1
woman	1
of	1
about	1
forty,	1
with	1
a	1
double	1
chin	1
and	1
full	1
red	1
lips,	1
entered	1
carrying	1
a	1
large	1
loaded	1
tray.	1
With	1
hospitable	1
dignity	1
and	1
cordiality	1
in	1
her	1
glance	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
motion,	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
visitors	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile,	1
bowed	1
respectfully.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
exceptional	1
stoutness,	1
which	1
caused	1
her	1
to	1
protrude	1
her	1
chest	1
and	1
stomach	1
and	1
throw	1
back	1
her	1
head,	1
this	1
woman	1
(who	1
was	1
"Uncle's"	1
housekeeper)	1
trod	1
very	1
lightly.	1
She	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
set	1
down	1
the	1
tray,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
plump	1
white	1
hands	1
deftly	1
took	1
from	1
it	1
the	1
bottles	1
and	1
various	1
hors	1
d'oeuvres	1
and	1
dishes	1
and	1
arranged	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
finished,	1
she	1
stepped	1
aside	1
and	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
"Here	1
I	1
am.	1
I	1
am	1
she!	1
Now	1
do	1
you	1
understand	1
'Uncle'?"	1
her	1
expression	1
said	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
How	1
could	1
one	1
help	1
understanding?	1
Not	1
only	1
Nicholas,	1
but	1
even	1
Natasha	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
puckered	1
brow	1
and	1
the	1
happy	1
complacent	1
smile	1
that	1
slightly	1
puckered	1
his	1
lips	1
when	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna	1
entered.	1
On	1
the	1
tray	1
was	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
herb	1
wine,	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
vodka,	1
pickled	1
mushrooms,	1
rye	1
cakes	1
made	1
with	1
buttermilk,	1
honey	1
in	1
the	1
comb,	1
still	1
mead	1
and	1
sparkling	1
mead,	1
apples,	1
nuts	1
(raw	1
and	1
roasted),	1
and	1
nut-and-honey	1
sweets.	1
Afterwards	1
she	1
brought	1
a	1
freshly	1
roasted	1
chicken,	1
ham,	1
preserves	1
made	1
with	1
honey,	1
and	1
preserves	1
made	1
with	1
sugar.	1
	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna's	1
housekeeping,	1
gathered	1
and	1
prepared	1
by	1
her.	1
The	1
smell	1
and	1
taste	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
had	1
a	1
smack	1
of	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna	1
herself:	1
a	1
savor	1
of	1
juiciness,	1
cleanliness,	1
whiteness,	1
and	1
pleasant	1
smiles.	1
	1
"Take	1
this,	1
little	1
Lady-Countess!"	1
she	1
kept	1
saying,	1
as	1
she	1
offered	1
Natasha	1
first	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
then	1
another.	1
	1
Natasha	1
ate	1
of	1
everything	1
and	1
thought	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
or	1
eaten	1
such	1
buttermilk	1
cakes,	1
such	1
aromatic	1
jam,	1
such	1
honey-and-nut	1
sweets,	1
or	1
such	1
a	1
chicken	1
anywhere.	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
After	1
supper,	1
over	1
their	1
cherry	1
brandy,	1
Rostov	1
and	1
"Uncle"	1
talked	1
of	1
past	1
and	1
future	1
hunts,	1
of	1
Rugay	1
and	1
Ilagin's	1
dogs,	1
while	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
upright	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes.	1
She	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
wake	1
Petya	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
eat	1
something,	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
muttered	1
incoherent	1
words	1
without	1
waking	1
up.	1
Natasha	1
felt	1
so	1
lighthearted	1
and	1
happy	1
in	1
these	1
novel	1
surroundings	1
that	1
she	1
only	1
feared	1
the	1
trap	1
would	1
come	1
for	1
her	1
too	1
soon.	1
After	1
a	1
casual	1
pause,	1
such	1
as	1
often	1
occurs	1
when	1
receiving	1
friends	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
one's	1
own	1
house,	1
"Uncle,"	1
answering	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
visitors'	1
minds,	1
said:	1
	1
"This,	1
you	1
see,	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
am	1
finishing	1
my	1
days...	1
Death	1
will	1
come.	1
That's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!	1
Nothing	1
will	1
remain.	1
Then	1
why	1
harm	1
anyone?"	1
	1
"Uncle's"	1
face	1
was	1
very	1
significant	1
and	1
even	1
handsome	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this.	1
Involuntarily	1
Rostov	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
about	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
neighbors.	1
Throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
province	1
"Uncle"	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
most	1
honorable	1
and	1
disinterested	1
of	1
cranks.	1
They	1
called	1
him	1
in	1
to	1
decide	1
family	1
disputes,	1
chose	1
him	1
as	1
executor,	1
confided	1
secrets	1
to	1
him,	1
elected	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
justice	1
and	1
to	1
other	1
posts;	1
but	1
he	1
always	1
persistently	1
refused	1
public	1
appointments,	1
passing	1
the	1
autumn	1
and	1
spring	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
on	1
his	1
bay	1
gelding,	1
sitting	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
winter,	1
and	1
lying	1
in	1
his	1
overgrown	1
garden	1
in	1
summer.	1
	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
enter	1
the	1
service,	1
Uncle?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
once,	1
but	1
gave	1
it	1
up.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
fit	1
for	1
it.	1
That's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
head	1
or	1
tail	1
of	1
it.	1
That's	1
for	1
you--I	1
haven't	1
brains	1
enough.	1
Now,	1
hunting	1
is	1
another	1
matter--that's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!	1
Open	1
the	1
door,	1
there!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
"Why	1
have	1
you	1
shut	1
it?"	1
	1
The	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
huntsmen's	1
room,	1
as	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
hunt	1
servants.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
rapid	1
patter	1
of	1
bare	1
feet,	1
and	1
an	1
unseen	1
hand	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
huntsmen's	1
room,	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
clear	1
sounds	1
of	1
a	1
balalayka	1
on	1
which	1
someone,	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
a	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
art,	1
was	1
playing.	1
Natasha	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
to	1
those	1
strains	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
and	1
now	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
to	1
hear	1
better.	1
	1
"That's	1
Mitka,	1
my	1
coachman....	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
him	1
a	1
good	1
balalayka.	1
I'm	1
fond	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
"Uncle."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
for	1
Mitka	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
balalayka	1
in	1
the	1
huntsmen's	1
room	1
when	1
"Uncle"	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
chase.	1
"Uncle"	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
such	1
music.	1
	1
"How	1
good!	1
Really	1
very	1
good!"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
with	1
some	1
unintentional	1
superciliousness,	1
as	1
if	1
ashamed	1
to	1
confess	1
that	1
the	1
sounds	1
pleased	1
him	1
very	1
much.	1
	1
"Very	1
good?"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
reproachfully,	1
noticing	1
her	1
brother's	1
tone.	1
"Not	1
'very	1
good'	1
it's	1
simply	1
delicious!"	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
"Uncle's"	1
pickled	1
mushrooms,	1
honey,	1
and	1
cherry	1
brandy	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
best	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
so	1
also	1
that	1
song,	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
acme	1
of	1
musical	1
delight.	1
	1
"More,	1
please,	1
more!"	1
cried	1
Natasha	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
balalayka	1
ceased.	1
Mitka	1
tuned	1
up	1
afresh,	1
and	1
recommenced	1
thrumming	1
the	1
balalayka	1
to	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
My	1
Lady,	1
with	1
trills	1
and	1
variations.	1
"Uncle"	1
sat	1
listening,	1
slightly	1
smiling,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side.	1
The	1
air	1
was	1
repeated	1
a	1
hundred	1
times.	1
The	1
balalayka	1
was	1
retuned	1
several	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
notes	1
were	1
thrummed	1
again,	1
but	1
the	1
listeners	1
did	1
not	1
grow	1
weary	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again.	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
leaned	1
her	1
portly	1
person	1
against	1
the	1
doorpost.	1
	1
"You	1
like	1
listening?"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
extremely	1
like	1
"Uncle's."	1
"That's	1
a	1
good	1
player	1
of	1
ours,"	1
she	1
added.	1
	1
"He	1
doesn't	1
play	1
that	1
part	1
right!"	1
said	1
"Uncle"	1
suddenly,	1
with	1
an	1
energetic	1
gesture.	1
"Here	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
burst	1
out--that's	1
it,	1
come	1
on!--	1
ought	1
to	1
burst	1
out."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
play	1
then?"	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Uncle"	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
but	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Anisya,	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
strings	1
of	1
my	1
guitar	1
are	1
all	1
right.	1
I	1
haven't	1
touched	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
That's	1
it--come	1
on!	1
I've	1
given	1
it	1
up."	1
	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna,	1
with	1
her	1
light	1
step,	1
willingly	1
went	1
to	1
fulfill	1
her	1
errand	1
and	1
brought	1
back	1
the	1
guitar.	1
	1
Without	1
looking	1
at	1
anyone,	1
"Uncle"	1
blew	1
the	1
dust	1
off	1
it	1
and,	1
tapping	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
his	1
bony	1
fingers,	1
tuned	1
the	1
guitar	1
and	1
settled	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
armchair.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
guitar	1
a	1
little	1
above	1
the	1
fingerboard,	1
arching	1
his	1
left	1
elbow	1
with	1
a	1
somewhat	1
theatrical	1
gesture,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
wink	1
at	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna,	1
struck	1
a	1
single	1
chord,	1
pure	1
and	1
sonorous,	1
and	1
then	1
quietly,	1
smoothly,	1
and	1
confidently	1
began	1
playing	1
in	1
very	1
slow	1
time,	1
not	1
My	1
Lady,	1
but	1
the	1
well-known	1
song:	1
Came	1
a	1
maiden	1
down	1
the	1
street.	1
The	1
tune,	1
played	1
with	1
precision	1
and	1
in	1
exact	1
time,	1
began	1
to	1
thrill	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
arousing	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
sober	1
mirth	1
as	1
radiated	1
from	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna's	1
whole	1
being.	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna	1
flushed,	1
and	1
drawing	1
her	1
kerchief	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
went	1
laughing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
"Uncle"	1
continued	1
to	1
play	1
correctly,	1
carefully,	1
with	1
energetic	1
firmness,	1
looking	1
with	1
a	1
changed	1
and	1
inspired	1
expression	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna	1
had	1
just	1
stood.	1
Something	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
laughing	1
a	1
little	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
under	1
his	1
gray	1
mustaches,	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
song	1
grew	1
brisker	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
quicker	1
and	1
when,	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
his	1
fingers	1
over	1
the	1
strings,	1
something	1
seemed	1
to	1
snap.	1
	1
"Lovely,	1
lovely!	1
Go	1
on,	1
Uncle,	1
go	1
on!"	1
shouted	1
Natasha	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
finished.	1
She	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
hugged	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
"Nicholas,	1
Nicholas!"	1
she	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
him:	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
moves	1
me	1
so?"	1
	1
Nicholas	1
too	1
was	1
greatly	1
pleased	1
by	1
"Uncle's"	1
playing,	1
and	1
"Uncle"	1
played	1
the	1
piece	1
over	1
again.	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna's	1
smiling	1
face	1
reappeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
and	1
behind	1
hers	1
other	1
faces...	1
	1
	1
Fetching	1
water	1
clear	1
and	1
sweet,	1
Stop,	1
dear	1
maiden,	1
I	1
entreat--	1
	1
played	1
"Uncle"	1
once	1
more,	1
running	1
his	1
fingers	1
skillfully	1
over	1
the	1
strings,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
and	1
jerked	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"Go	1
on,	1
Uncle	1
dear,"	1
Natasha	1
wailed	1
in	1
an	1
imploring	1
tone	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
life	1
depended	1
on	1
it.	1
	1
"Uncle"	1
rose,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
him:	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
smiled	1
seriously	1
at	1
the	1
merry	1
fellow,	1
while	1
the	1
merry	1
fellow	1
struck	1
a	1
naive	1
and	1
precise	1
attitude	1
preparatory	1
to	1
a	1
folk	1
dance.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
niece!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
waving	1
to	1
Natasha	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
struck	1
a	1
chord.	1
	1
Natasha	1
threw	1
off	1
the	1
shawl	1
from	1
her	1
shoulders,	1
ran	1
forward	1
to	1
face	1
"Uncle,"	1
and	1
setting	1
her	1
arms	1
akimbo	1
also	1
made	1
a	1
motion	1
with	1
her	1
shoulders	1
and	1
struck	1
an	1
attitude.	1
	1
Where,	1
how,	1
and	1
when	1
had	1
this	1
young	1
countess,	1
educated	1
by	1
an	1
emigree	1
French	1
governess,	1
imbibed	1
from	1
the	1
Russian	1
air	1
she	1
breathed	1
that	1
spirit	1
and	1
obtained	1
that	1
manner	1
which	1
the	1
pas	1
de	1
chale	1
*	1
would,	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
supposed,	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
effaced?	1
But	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
the	1
movements	1
were	1
those	1
inimitable	1
and	1
unteachable	1
Russian	1
ones	1
that	1
"Uncle"	1
had	1
expected	1
of	1
her.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
struck	1
her	1
pose,	1
and	1
smiled	1
triumphantly,	1
proudly,	1
and	1
with	1
sly	1
merriment,	1
the	1
fear	1
that	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
seized	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
do	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
already	1
admiring	1
her.	1
	1
	1
*	1
The	1
French	1
shawl	1
dance.	1
	1
She	1
did	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
with	1
such	1
precision,	1
such	1
complete	1
precision,	1
that	1
Anisya	1
Fedorovna,	1
who	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
handed	1
her	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
she	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
dance,	1
had	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
though	1
she	1
laughed	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
this	1
slim,	1
graceful	1
countess,	1
reared	1
in	1
silks	1
and	1
velvets	1
and	1
so	1
different	1
from	1
herself,	1
who	1
yet	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
understand	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Anisya	1
and	1
in	1
Anisya's	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
and	1
aunt,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
Russian	1
man	1
and	1
woman.	1
	1
"Well,	1
little	1
countess;	1
that's	1
it--come	1
on!"	1
cried	1
"Uncle,"	1
with	1
a	1
joyous	1
laugh,	1
having	1
finished	1
the	1
dance.	1
"Well	1
done,	1
niece!	1
Now	1
a	1
fine	1
young	1
fellow	1
must	1
be	1
found	1
as	1
husband	1
for	1
you.	1
That's	1
it--come	1
on!"	1
	1
"He's	1
chosen	1
already,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
smiling.	1
	1
"Oh?"	1
said	1
"Uncle"	1
in	1
surprise,	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
nodded	1
her	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
smile.	1
	1
"And	1
such	1
a	1
one!"	1
she	1
said.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
a	1
new	1
train	1
of	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
arose	1
in	1
her.	1
"What	1
did	1
Nicholas'	1
smile	1
mean	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
'chosen	1
already'?	1
Is	1
he	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
or	1
not?	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
my	1
Bolkonski	1
would	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
or	1
understand	1
our	1
gaiety.	1
But	1
he	1
would	1
understand	1
it	1
all.	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
now?"	1
she	1
thought,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
suddenly	1
became	1
serious.	1
But	1
this	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
second.	1
"Don't	1
dare	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
smilingly	1
beside	1
"Uncle,"	1
begging	1
him	1
to	1
play	1
something	1
more.	1
	1
"Uncle"	1
played	1
another	1
song	1
and	1
a	1
valse;	1
then	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
he	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
sang	1
his	1
favorite	1
hunting	1
song:	1
	1
	1
As	1
'twas	1
growing	1
dark	1
last	1
night	1
Fell	1
the	1
snow	1
so	1
soft	1
and	1
light...	1
	1
"Uncle"	1
sang	1
as	1
peasants	1
sing,	1
with	1
full	1
and	1
naive	1
conviction	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
a	1
song	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
tune	1
comes	1
of	1
itself,	1
and	1
that	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
tune,	1
which	1
exists	1
only	1
to	1
give	1
measure	1
to	1
the	1
words.	1
As	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
unconsidered	1
tune,	1
like	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
a	1
bird,	1
was	1
extraordinarily	1
good.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
in	1
ecstasies	1
over	1
"Uncle's"	1
singing.	1
She	1
resolved	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
learning	1
the	1
harp	1
and	1
to	1
play	1
only	1
the	1
guitar.	1
She	1
asked	1
"Uncle"	1
for	1
his	1
guitar	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
found	1
the	1
chords	1
of	1
the	1
song.	1
	1
After	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
two	1
traps	1
and	1
three	1
mounted	1
men,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
them,	1
arrived	1
to	1
fetch	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Petya.	1
The	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
and	1
were	1
very	1
anxious,	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men.	1
	1
Petya	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
log	1
and	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
larger	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
traps.	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
other.	1
"Uncle"	1
wrapped	1
Natasha	1
up	1
warmly	1
and	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
quite	1
a	1
new	1
tenderness.	1
He	1
accompanied	1
them	1
on	1
foot	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
bridge	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
crossed,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
by	1
the	1
ford,	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
huntsmen	1
to	1
ride	1
in	1
front	1
with	1
lanterns.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
dear	1
niece,"	1
his	1
voice	1
called	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
darkness--not	1
the	1
voice	1
Natasha	1
had	1
known	1
previously,	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
sung	1
As	1
'twas	1
growing	1
dark	1
last	1
night.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
village	1
through	1
which	1
they	1
passed	1
there	1
were	1
red	1
lights	1
and	1
a	1
cheerful	1
smell	1
of	1
smoke.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
darling	1
Uncle	1
is!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
highroad.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
returned	1
Nicholas.	1
"You're	1
not	1
cold?"	1
	1
"No.	1
I'm	1
quite,	1
quite	1
all	1
right.	1
I	1
feel	1
so	1
comfortable!"	1
answered	1
Natasha,	1
almost	1
perplexed	1
by	1
her	1
feelings.	1
They	1
remained	1
silent	1
a	1
long	1
while.	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
damp.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
horses,	1
but	1
only	1
heard	1
them	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
unseen	1
mud.	1
	1
What	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
that	1
receptive	1
childlike	1
soul	1
that	1
so	1
eagerly	1
caught	1
and	1
assimilated	1
all	1
the	1
diverse	1
impressions	1
of	1
life?	1
How	1
did	1
they	1
all	1
find	1
place	1
in	1
her?	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
happy.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
nearing	1
home	1
she	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
up	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
As	1
'twas	1
growing	1
dark	1
last	1
night--the	1
tune	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
and	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
caught.	1
	1
"Got	1
it?"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"What	1
were	1
you	1
thinking	1
about	1
just	1
now,	1
Nicholas?"	1
inquired	1
Natasha.	1
	1
They	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
asking	1
one	1
another	1
that	1
question.	1
	1
"I?"	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
trying	1
to	1
remember.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
first	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
Rugay,	1
the	1
red	1
hound,	1
was	1
like	1
Uncle,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
would	1
always	1
keep	1
Uncle	1
near	1
him,	1
if	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
riding,	1
then	1
for	1
his	1
manner.	1
What	1
a	1
good	1
fellow	1
Uncle	1
is!	1
Don't	1
you	1
think	1
so?...	1
Well,	1
and	1
you?"	1
	1
"I?	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
wait....	1
Yes,	1
first	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
driving	1
along	1
and	1
imagining	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
home,	1
but	1
that	1
heaven	1
knows	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
really	1
going	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
arrive	1
and	1
suddenly	1
find	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
Otradnoe,	1
but	1
in	1
Fairyland.	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
thought...	1
No,	1
nothing	1
else."	1
	1
"I	1
know,	1
I	1
expect	1
you	1
thought	1
of	1
him,"	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
smiling	1
as	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
in	1
reality	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
"Uncle."	1
"And	1
then	1
I	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
myself	1
all	1
the	1
way,	1
'How	1
well	1
Anisya	1
carried	1
herself,	1
how	1
well!'"	1
And	1
Nicholas	1
heard	1
her	1
spontaneous,	1
happy,	1
ringing	1
laughter.	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
know,"	1
she	1
suddenly	1
said,	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
again	1
be	1
as	1
happy	1
and	1
tranquil	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
now."	1
	1
"Rubbish,	1
nonsense,	1
humbug!"	1
exclaimed	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
he	1
thought:	1
"How	1
charming	1
this	1
Natasha	1
of	1
mine	1
is!	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
friend	1
like	1
her	1
and	1
never	1
shall	1
have.	1
Why	1
should	1
she	1
marry?	1
We	1
might	1
always	1
drive	1
about	1
together!"	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
darling	1
this	1
Nicholas	1
of	1
mine	1
is!"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
there	1
are	1
still	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room!"	1
she	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
gleamed	1
invitingly	1
in	1
the	1
moist	1
velvety	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
had	1
resigned	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Marshal	1
of	1
the	1
Nobility	1
because	1
it	1
involved	1
him	1
in	1
too	1
much	1
expense,	1
but	1
still	1
his	1
affairs	1
did	1
not	1
improve.	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
often	1
noticed	1
their	1
parents	1
conferring	1
together	1
anxiously	1
and	1
privately	1
and	1
heard	1
suggestions	1
of	1
selling	1
the	1
fine	1
ancestral	1
Rostov	1
house	1
and	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
necessary	1
to	1
entertain	1
so	1
freely	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
been	1
Marshal,	1
and	1
life	1
at	1
Otradnoe	1
was	1
quieter	1
than	1
in	1
former	1
years,	1
but	1
still	1
the	1
enormous	1
house	1
and	1
its	1
lodges	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
people	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
table	1
every	1
day.	1
These	1
were	1
all	1
their	1
own	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
almost	1
as	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
or	1
persons	1
who	1
were,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
obliged	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
count's	1
house.	1
Such	1
were	1
Dimmler	1
the	1
musician	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
Vogel	1
the	1
dancing	1
master	1
and	1
his	1
family,	1
Belova,	1
an	1
old	1
maiden	1
lady,	1
an	1
inmate	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
many	1
others	1
such	1
as	1
Petya's	1
tutors,	1
the	1
girls'	1
former	1
governess,	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
who	1
simply	1
found	1
it	1
preferable	1
and	1
more	1
advantageous	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
count's	1
house	1
than	1
at	1
home.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
as	1
many	1
visitors	1
as	1
before,	1
but	1
the	1
old	1
habits	1
of	1
life	1
without	1
which	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
of	1
existence	1
remained	1
unchanged.	1
There	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
hunting	1
establishment	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
even	1
enlarged,	1
the	1
same	1
fifty	1
horses	1
and	1
fifteen	1
grooms	1
in	1
the	1
stables,	1
the	1
same	1
expensive	1
presents	1
and	1
dinner	1
parties	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
district	1
on	1
name	1
days;	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
the	1
count's	1
games	1
of	1
whist	1
and	1
boston,	1
at	1
which--spreading	1
out	1
his	1
cards	1
so	1
that	1
everybody	1
could	1
see	1
them--he	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
plundered	1
of	1
hundreds	1
of	1
rubles	1
every	1
day	1
by	1
his	1
neighbors,	1
who	1
looked	1
upon	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
play	1
a	1
rubber	1
with	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
profitable	1
source	1
of	1
income.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
moved	1
in	1
his	1
affairs	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
huge	1
net,	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
entangled	1
but	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
so	1
at	1
every	1
step,	1
and	1
feeling	1
too	1
feeble	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
meshes	1
or	1
to	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
carefully	1
and	1
patiently	1
to	1
disentangle	1
them.	1
The	1
countess,	1
with	1
her	1
loving	1
heart,	1
felt	1
that	1
her	1
children	1
were	1
being	1
ruined,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
count's	1
fault	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
what	1
he	1
was--that	1
(though	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
it)	1
he	1
himself	1
suffered	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
his	1
children's	1
ruin,	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
means	1
of	1
remedying	1
the	1
position.	1
From	1
her	1
feminine	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
only	1
one	1
solution,	1
namely,	1
for	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
marry	1
a	1
rich	1
heiress.	1
She	1
felt	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
last	1
hope	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
Nicholas	1
refused	1
the	1
match	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
for	1
him,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
ever	1
getting	1
matters	1
right.	1
This	1
match	1
was	1
with	1
Julie	1
Karagina,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
excellent	1
and	1
virtuous	1
parents,	1
a	1
girl	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
had	1
known	1
from	1
childhood,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
now	1
become	1
a	1
wealthy	1
heiress	1
through	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
her	1
brothers.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
written	1
direct	1
to	1
Julie's	1
mother	1
in	1
Moscow	1
suggesting	1
a	1
marriage	1
between	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
favorable	1
answer	1
from	1
her.	1
Karagina	1
had	1
replied	1
that	1
for	1
her	1
part	1
she	1
was	1
agreeable,	1
and	1
everything	1
depend	1
on	1
her	1
daughter's	1
inclination.	1
She	1
invited	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
Several	1
times	1
the	1
countess,	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
told	1
her	1
son	1
that	1
now	1
both	1
her	1
daughters	1
were	1
settled,	1
her	1
only	1
wish	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
married.	1
She	1
said	1
she	1
could	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
grave	1
peacefully	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
accomplished.	1
Then	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
a	1
splendid	1
girl	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
about	1
marriage.	1
	1
At	1
other	1
times	1
she	1
praised	1
Julie	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Moscow	1
during	1
the	1
holidays	1
to	1
amuse	1
himself.	1
Nicholas	1
guessed	1
what	1
his	1
mother's	1
remarks	1
were	1
leading	1
to	1
and	1
during	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
conversations	1
induced	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
quite	1
frankly.	1
She	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
her	1
only	1
hope	1
of	1
getting	1
their	1
affairs	1
disentangled	1
now	1
lay	1
in	1
his	1
marrying	1
Julie	1
Karagina.	1
	1
"But,	1
Mamma,	1
suppose	1
I	1
loved	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
has	1
no	1
fortune,	1
would	1
you	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
my	1
feelings	1
and	1
my	1
honor	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
money?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
mother,	1
not	1
realizing	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
his	1
question	1
and	1
only	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
noble-mindedness.	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
understood	1
me,"	1
said	1
his	1
mother,	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
justify	1
herself.	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
understood	1
me,	1
Nikolenka.	1
It	1
is	1
your	1
happiness	1
I	1
wish	1
for,"	1
she	1
added,	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
telling	1
an	1
untruth	1
and	1
was	1
becoming	1
entangled.	1
She	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
don't	1
cry!	1
Only	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
wish	1
it,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
my	1
life,	1
anything,	1
to	1
put	1
you	1
at	1
ease,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"I	1
would	1
sacrifice	1
anything	1
for	1
you--even	1
my	1
feelings."	1
	1
But	1
the	1
countess	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
the	1
question	1
put	1
like	1
that:	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
from	1
her	1
son,	1
she	1
herself	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
understood	1
me,	1
don't	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
it,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
wiping	1
away	1
her	1
tears.	1
	1
"Maybe	1
I	1
do	1
love	1
a	1
poor	1
girl,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Am	1
I	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
my	1
feelings	1
and	1
my	1
honor	1
for	1
money?	1
I	1
wonder	1
how	1
Mamma	1
could	1
speak	1
so	1
to	1
me.	1
Because	1
Sonya	1
is	1
poor	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
love	1
her,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"must	1
not	1
respond	1
to	1
her	1
faithful,	1
devoted	1
love?	1
Yet	1
I	1
should	1
certainly	1
be	1
happier	1
with	1
her	1
than	1
with	1
some	1
doll-like	1
Julie.	1
I	1
can	1
always	1
sacrifice	1
my	1
feelings	1
for	1
my	1
family's	1
welfare,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"but	1
I	1
can't	1
coerce	1
my	1
feelings.	1
If	1
I	1
love	1
Sonya,	1
that	1
feeling	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
stronger	1
and	1
higher	1
than	1
all	1
else."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
did	1
not	1
renew	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
marriage.	1
She	1
saw	1
with	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
with	1
exasperation,	1
symptoms	1
of	1
a	1
growing	1
attachment	1
between	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
portionless	1
Sonya.	1
Though	1
she	1
blamed	1
herself	1
for	1
it,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
grumbling	1
at	1
and	1
worrying	1
Sonya,	1
often	1
pulling	1
her	1
up	1
without	1
reason,	1
addressing	1
her	1
stiffly	1
as	1
"my	1
dear,"	1
and	1
using	1
the	1
formal	1
"you"	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
intimate	1
"thou"	1
in	1
speaking	1
to	1
her.	1
The	1
kindhearted	1
countess	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
vexed	1
with	1
Sonya	1
because	1
that	1
poor,	1
dark-eyed	1
niece	1
of	1
hers	1
was	1
so	1
meek,	1
so	1
kind,	1
so	1
devotedly	1
grateful	1
to	1
her	1
benefactors,	1
and	1
so	1
faithfully,	1
unchangingly,	1
and	1
unselfishly	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Nicholas,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
grounds	1
for	1
finding	1
fault	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
spending	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
his	1
leave	1
at	1
home.	1
A	1
fourth	1
letter	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
from	1
Rome,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
Russia	1
long	1
ago	1
had	1
not	1
his	1
wound	1
unexpectedly	1
reopened	1
in	1
the	1
warm	1
climate,	1
which	1
obliged	1
him	1
to	1
defer	1
his	1
return	1
till	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
year.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
still	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
betrothed,	1
found	1
the	1
same	1
comfort	1
in	1
that	1
love,	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
as	1
ready	1
to	1
throw	1
herself	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
life	1
as	1
before;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
month	1
of	1
their	1
separation	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
fits	1
of	1
depression	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
master.	1
She	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
herself:	1
sorry	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
being	1
wasted	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
anyone--	1
while	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
so	1
capable	1
of	1
loving	1
and	1
being	1
loved.	1
	1
Things	1
were	1
not	1
cheerful	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
home.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Christmas	1
came	1
and	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
ceremonial	1
Mass,	1
the	1
solemn	1
and	1
wearisome	1
Christmas	1
congratulations	1
from	1
neighbors	1
and	1
servants,	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
dresses	1
everyone	1
put	1
on,	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
special	1
festivities,	1
though	1
the	1
calm	1
frost	1
of	1
twenty	1
degrees	1
Reaumur,	1
the	1
dazzling	1
sunshine	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
starlight	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
nights	1
seemed	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
some	1
special	1
celebration	1
of	1
the	1
season.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
of	1
Christmas	1
week,	1
after	1
the	1
midday	1
dinner,	1
all	1
the	1
inmates	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
dispersed	1
to	1
various	1
rooms.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
dullest	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
visiting	1
some	1
neighbors	1
that	1
morning,	1
was	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
sitting-room	1
sofa.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
was	1
resting	1
in	1
his	1
study.	1
Sonya	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
round	1
table,	1
copying	1
a	1
design	1
for	1
embroidery.	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
playing	1
patience.	1
Nastasya	1
Ivanovna	1
the	1
buffoon	1
sat	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
face	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
with	1
two	1
old	1
ladies.	1
Natasha	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Sonya,	1
glanced	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
stood	1
without	1
speaking.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
wandering	1
about	1
like	1
an	1
outcast?"	1
asked	1
her	1
mother.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
	1
"Him...	1
I	1
want	1
him...	1
now,	1
this	1
minute!	1
I	1
want	1
him!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
and	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
lifted	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
attentively	1
at	1
her	1
daughter.	1
	1
"Don't	1
look	1
at	1
me,	1
Mamma!	1
Don't	1
look;	1
I	1
shall	1
cry	1
directly."	1
	1
"Sit	1
down	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
little,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
I	1
want	1
him.	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
be	1
wasted	1
like	1
this,	1
Mamma?"	1
	1
Her	1
voice	1
broke,	1
tears	1
gushed	1
from	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
quickly	1
to	1
hide	1
them	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
She	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
stood	1
there	1
thinking	1
awhile,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
maids'	1
room.	1
There	1
an	1
old	1
maidservant	1
was	1
grumbling	1
at	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
who	1
stood	1
panting,	1
having	1
just	1
run	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
cold	1
from	1
the	1
serfs'	1
quarters.	1
	1
"Stop	1
playing--there's	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
everything,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
woman.	1
	1
"Let	1
her	1
alone,	1
Kondratevna,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Go,	1
Mavrushka,	1
go."	1
	1
Having	1
released	1
Mavrushka,	1
Natasha	1
crossed	1
the	1
dancing	1
hall	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
vestibule.	1
There	1
an	1
old	1
footman	1
and	1
two	1
young	1
ones	1
were	1
playing	1
cards.	1
They	1
broke	1
off	1
and	1
rose	1
as	1
she	1
entered.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
with	1
them?"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Nikita,	1
please	1
go...	1
where	1
can	1
I	1
send	1
him?...	1
Yes,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
fetch	1
a	1
fowl,	1
please,	1
a	1
cock,	1
and	1
you,	1
Misha,	1
bring	1
me	1
some	1
oats."	1
	1
"Just	1
a	1
few	1
oats?"	1
said	1
Misha,	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
readily.	1
	1
"Go,	1
go	1
quickly,"	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
urged	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
you,	1
Theodore,	1
get	1
me	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
chalk."	1
	1
On	1
her	1
way	1
past	1
the	1
butler's	1
pantry	1
she	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
samovar,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
tea.	1
	1
Foka,	1
the	1
butler,	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
ill-tempered	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
Natasha	1
liked	1
to	1
test	1
her	1
power	1
over	1
him.	1
He	1
distrusted	1
the	1
order	1
and	1
asked	1
whether	1
the	1
samovar	1
was	1
really	1
wanted.	1
	1
"Oh	1
dear,	1
what	1
a	1
young	1
lady!"	1
said	1
Foka,	1
pretending	1
to	1
frown	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
	1
No	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
sent	1
people	1
about	1
or	1
gave	1
them	1
as	1
much	1
trouble	1
as	1
Natasha	1
did.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
people	1
unconcernedly,	1
but	1
had	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
on	1
some	1
errand.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
trying	1
whether	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
get	1
angry	1
or	1
sulky	1
with	1
her;	1
but	1
the	1
serfs	1
fulfilled	1
no	1
one's	1
orders	1
so	1
readily	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
hers.	1
"What	1
can	1
I	1
do,	1
where	1
can	1
I	1
go?"	1
thought	1
she,	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
slowly	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
	1
"Nastasya	1
Ivanovna,	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
children	1
shall	1
I	1
have?"	1
she	1
asked	1
the	1
buffoon,	1
who	1
was	1
coming	1
toward	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
woman's	1
jacket.	1
	1
"Why,	1
fleas,	1
crickets,	1
grasshoppers,"	1
answered	1
the	1
buffoon.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
it's	1
always	1
the	1
same!	1
Oh,	1
where	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
go?	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
myself?"	1
And	1
tapping	1
with	1
her	1
heels,	1
she	1
ran	1
quickly	1
upstairs	1
to	1
see	1
Vogel	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
lived	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
story.	1
	1
Two	1
governesses	1
were	1
sitting	1
with	1
the	1
Vogels	1
at	1
a	1
table,	1
on	1
which	1
were	1
plates	1
of	1
raisins,	1
walnuts,	1
and	1
almonds.	1
The	1
governesses	1
were	1
discussing	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
cheaper	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
Moscow	1
or	1
Odessa.	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
down,	1
listened	1
to	1
their	1
talk	1
with	1
a	1
serious	1
and	1
thoughtful	1
air,	1
and	1
then	1
got	1
up	1
again.	1
	1
"The	1
island	1
of	1
Madagascar,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"Ma-da-gas-car,"	1
she	1
repeated,	1
articulating	1
each	1
syllable	1
distinctly,	1
and,	1
not	1
replying	1
to	1
Madame	1
Schoss	1
who	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying,	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Her	1
brother	1
Petya	1
was	1
upstairs	1
too;	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
fireworks	1
to	1
let	1
off	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
"Petya!	1
Petya!"	1
she	1
called	1
to	1
him.	1
"Carry	1
me	1
downstairs."	1
	1
Petya	1
ran	1
up	1
and	1
offered	1
her	1
his	1
back.	1
She	1
jumped	1
on	1
it,	1
putting	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
he	1
pranced	1
along	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
"No,	1
don't...	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Madagascar!"	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
jumping	1
off	1
his	1
back	1
she	1
went	1
downstairs.	1
	1
Having	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
reviewed	1
her	1
kingdom,	1
tested	1
her	1
power,	1
and	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
submissive,	1
but	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
it	1
was	1
dull,	1
Natasha	1
betook	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
picked	1
up	1
her	1
guitar,	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
corner	1
behind	1
a	1
bookcase,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
her	1
fingers	1
over	1
the	1
strings	1
in	1
the	1
bass,	1
picking	1
out	1
a	1
passage	1
she	1
recalled	1
from	1
an	1
opera	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
What	1
she	1
drew	1
from	1
the	1
guitar	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
meaning	1
for	1
other	1
listeners,	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
reminiscences	1
arose	1
from	1
those	1
sounds.	1
She	1
sat	1
behind	1
the	1
bookcase	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
streak	1
of	1
light	1
escaping	1
from	1
the	1
pantry	1
door	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
pondered.	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
mood	1
for	1
brooding	1
on	1
the	1
past.	1
	1
Sonya	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
pantry	1
with	1
a	1
glass	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
Natasha	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
crack	1
in	1
the	1
pantry	1
door,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
remembered	1
the	1
light	1
falling	1
through	1
that	1
crack	1
once	1
before	1
and	1
Sonya	1
passing	1
with	1
a	1
glass	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
"Yes	1
it	1
was	1
exactly	1
the	1
same,"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
what	1
is	1
this?"	1
she	1
cried,	1
twanging	1
a	1
thick	1
string.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
are	1
there!"	1
said	1
Sonya	1
with	1
a	1
start,	1
and	1
came	1
near	1
and	1
listened.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know.	1
A	1
storm?"	1
she	1
ventured	1
timidly,	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
wrong.	1
	1
"There!	1
That's	1
just	1
how	1
she	1
started	1
and	1
just	1
how	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
smiling	1
timidly	1
when	1
all	1
this	1
happened	1
before,"	1
thought	1
Natasha,	1
"and	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
I	1
thought	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
lacking	1
in	1
her."	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
the	1
chorus	1
from	1
The	1
Water-Carrier,	1
listen!"	1
and	1
Natasha	1
sang	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
chorus	1
so	1
that	1
Sonya	1
should	1
catch	1
it.	1
"Where	1
were	1
you	1
going?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"To	1
change	1
the	1
water	1
in	1
this	1
glass.	1
I	1
am	1
just	1
finishing	1
the	1
design."	1
	1
"You	1
always	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
I	1
can't,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"And	1
where's	1
Nicholas?"	1
	1
"Asleep,	1
I	1
think."	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
go	1
and	1
wake	1
him,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Tell	1
him	1
I	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
sing."	1
	1
She	1
sat	1
awhile,	1
wondering	1
what	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
having	1
happened	1
before	1
could	1
be,	1
and	1
without	1
solving	1
this	1
problem,	1
or	1
at	1
all	1
regretting	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
so,	1
she	1
again	1
passed	1
in	1
fancy	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
lover's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
only	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
quicker!	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
afraid	1
it	1
will	1
never	1
be!	1
And,	1
worst	1
of	1
all,	1
I	1
am	1
growing	1
old--that's	1
the	1
thing!	1
There	1
won't	1
then	1
be	1
in	1
me	1
what	1
there	1
is	1
now.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
he'll	1
come	1
today,	1
will	1
come	1
immediately.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
and	1
is	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
came	1
yesterday	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
forgotten	1
it."	1
She	1
rose,	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
guitar,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
domestic	1
circle,	1
tutors,	1
governesses,	1
and	1
guests,	1
were	1
already	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table.	1
The	1
servants	1
stood	1
round	1
the	1
table--but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
and	1
life	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
here	1
she	1
is!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Natasha	1
enter.	1
"Well,	1
sit	1
down	1
by	1
me."	1
But	1
Natasha	1
stayed	1
by	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
glanced	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
looking	1
for	1
something.	1
	1
"Mamma!"	1
she	1
muttered,	1
"give	1
him	1
to	1
me,	1
give	1
him,	1
Mamma,	1
quickly,	1
quickly!"	1
and	1
she	1
again	1
had	1
difficulty	1
in	1
repressing	1
her	1
sobs.	1
	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
between	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1
"My	1
God,	1
my	1
God!	1
The	1
same	1
faces,	1
the	1
same	1
talk,	1
Papa	1
holding	1
his	1
cup	1
and	1
blowing	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way!"	1
thought	1
Natasha,	1
feeling	1
with	1
horror	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
repulsion	1
rising	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
household,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
always	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
After	1
tea,	1
Nicholas,	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
to	1
their	1
favorite	1
corner	1
where	1
their	1
most	1
intimate	1
talks	1
always	1
began.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
"Does	1
it	1
ever	1
happen	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
when	1
they	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
"does	1
it	1
ever	1
happen	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
come--nothing;	1
that	1
everything	1
good	1
is	1
past?	1
And	1
to	1
feel	1
not	1
exactly	1
dull,	1
but	1
sad?"	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
think	1
so!"	1
he	1
replied.	1
"I	1
have	1
felt	1
like	1
that	1
when	1
everything	1
was	1
all	1
right	1
and	1
everyone	1
was	1
cheerful.	1
The	1
thought	1
has	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
tired	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
die.	1
Once	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
to	1
some	1
merrymaking	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
music...	1
and	1
suddenly	1
I	1
felt	1
so	1
depressed..."	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know!"	1
Natasha	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
"When	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
little	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
me.	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
punished	1
once	1
about	1
some	1
plums?	1
You	1
were	1
all	1
dancing,	1
and	1
I	1
sat	1
sobbing	1
in	1
the	1
schoolroom?	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
it:	1
I	1
felt	1
sad	1
and	1
sorry	1
for	1
everyone,	1
for	1
myself,	1
and	1
for	1
everyone.	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
innocent--that	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember?"	1
	1
"I	1
remember,"	1
answered	1
Nicholas.	1
"I	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
you	1
afterwards	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
comfort	1
you,	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
to.	1
We	1
were	1
terribly	1
absurd.	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
funny	1
doll	1
then	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you.	1
Do	1
you	1
remember?"	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
remember,"	1
Natasha	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
pensive	1
smile,	1
"how	1
once,	1
long,	1
long	1
ago,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
quite	1
little,	1
Uncle	1
called	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
study--that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
house--and	1
it	1
was	1
dark--we	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
stood..."	1
	1
"A	1
Negro,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
Nicholas	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
delight.	1
"Of	1
course	1
I	1
remember.	1
Even	1
now	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
whether	1
there	1
really	1
was	1
a	1
Negro,	1
or	1
if	1
we	1
only	1
dreamed	1
it	1
or	1
were	1
told	1
about	1
him."	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
gray,	1
you	1
remember,	1
and	1
had	1
white	1
teeth,	1
and	1
stood	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
us..."	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
do	1
you	1
remember?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
do	1
remember	1
something	1
too,"	1
Sonya	1
answered	1
timidly.	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
Papa	1
and	1
Mamma	1
about	1
that	1
Negro,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
"and	1
they	1
say	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
Negro	1
at	1
all.	1
But	1
you	1
see,	1
you	1
remember!"	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
I	1
do,	1
I	1
remember	1
his	1
teeth	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
seen	1
them."	1
	1
"How	1
strange	1
it	1
is!	1
It's	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
dream!	1
I	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
rolled	1
hard-boiled	1
eggs	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
two	1
old	1
women	1
began	1
spinning	1
round	1
on	1
the	1
carpet?	1
Was	1
that	1
real	1
or	1
not?	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
what	1
fun	1
it	1
was?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
Papa	1
in	1
his	1
blue	1
overcoat	1
fired	1
a	1
gun	1
in	1
the	1
porch?"	1
	1
So	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
their	1
memories,	1
smiling	1
with	1
pleasure:	1
not	1
the	1
sad	1
memories	1
of	1
old	1
age,	1
but	1
poetic,	1
youthful	1
ones--those	1
impressions	1
of	1
one's	1
most	1
distant	1
past	1
in	1
which	1
dreams	1
and	1
realities	1
blend--and	1
they	1
laughed	1
with	1
quiet	1
enjoyment.	1
	1
Sonya,	1
as	1
always,	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
them,	1
though	1
they	1
shared	1
the	1
same	1
reminiscences.	1
	1
Much	1
that	1
they	1
remembered	1
had	1
slipped	1
from	1
her	1
mind,	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
recalled	1
did	1
not	1
arouse	1
the	1
same	1
poetic	1
feeling	1
as	1
they	1
experienced.	1
She	1
simply	1
enjoyed	1
their	1
pleasure	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
fit	1
in	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
She	1
only	1
really	1
took	1
part	1
when	1
they	1
recalled	1
Sonya's	1
first	1
arrival.	1
She	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
afraid	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
corded	1
jacket	1
and	1
her	1
nurse	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
she,	1
too,	1
would	1
be	1
sewn	1
up	1
with	1
cords.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
remember	1
their	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
under	1
a	1
cabbage,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
"and	1
I	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
disbelieve	1
it	1
then,	1
but	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
true,	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
so	1
uncomfortable."	1
	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
a	1
maid	1
thrust	1
her	1
head	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
"They	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
cock,	1
Miss,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
"It	1
isn't	1
wanted,	1
Petya.	1
Tell	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
away,"	1
replied	1
Natasha.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
their	1
talk	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
Dimmler	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
harp	1
that	1
stood	1
there	1
in	1
a	1
corner.	1
He	1
took	1
off	1
its	1
cloth	1
covering,	1
and	1
the	1
harp	1
gave	1
out	1
a	1
jarring	1
sound.	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Dimmler,	1
please	1
play	1
my	1
favorite	1
nocturne	1
by	1
Field,"	1
came	1
the	1
old	1
countess'	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
Dimmler	1
struck	1
a	1
chord	1
and,	1
turning	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
remarked:	1
"How	1
quiet	1
you	1
young	1
people	1
are!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we're	1
philosophizing,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
glancing	1
round	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
then	1
continuing	1
the	1
conversation.	1
They	1
were	1
now	1
discussing	1
dreams.	1
	1
Dimmler	1
began	1
to	1
play;	1
Natasha	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
noiselessly	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
candle,	1
carried	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
returned,	1
seating	1
herself	1
quietly	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
place.	1
It	1
was	1
dark	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
especially	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
big	1
windows	1
the	1
silvery	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
moon	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
Dimmler	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
piece	1
but	1
still	1
sat	1
softly	1
running	1
his	1
fingers	1
over	1
the	1
strings,	1
evidently	1
uncertain	1
whether	1
to	1
stop	1
or	1
to	1
play	1
something	1
else.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
moving	1
closer	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
"that	1
when	1
one	1
goes	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
recalling	1
memories,	1
one	1
at	1
last	1
begins	1
to	1
remember	1
what	1
happened	1
before	1
one	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
world..."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
metempsychosis,"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
learned	1
well,	1
and	1
remembered	1
everything.	1
"The	1
Egyptians	1
believed	1
that	1
our	1
souls	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
animals,	1
and	1
will	1
go	1
back	1
into	1
animals	1
again."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
we	1
ever	1
were	1
in	1
animals,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
still	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
though	1
the	1
music	1
had	1
ceased.	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
angels	1
somewhere	1
there,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
here,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
we	1
remember...."	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
join	1
you?"	1
said	1
Dimmler	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
quietly,	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
angels,	1
why	1
have	1
we	1
fallen	1
lower?"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"No,	1
that	1
can't	1
be!"	1
	1
"Not	1
lower,	1
who	1
said	1
we	1
were	1
lower?...	1
How	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
before?"	1
Natasha	1
rejoined	1
with	1
conviction.	1
"The	1
soul	1
is	1
immortal--well	1
then,	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
live	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
lived	1
before,	1
lived	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
eternity."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
imagine	1
eternity,"	1
remarked	1
Dimmler,	1
who	1
had	1
joined	1
the	1
young	1
folk	1
with	1
a	1
mildly	1
condescending	1
smile	1
but	1
now	1
spoke	1
as	1
quietly	1
and	1
seriously	1
as	1
they.	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
imagine	1
eternity?"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"It	1
is	1
now	1
today,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
tomorrow,	1
and	1
always;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
before..."	1
	1
"Natasha!	1
Now	1
it's	1
your	1
turn.	1
Sing	1
me	1
something,"	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
countess	1
say.	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
sitting	1
there	1
like	1
conspirators?"	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
I	1
don't	1
at	1
all	1
want	1
to,"	1
replied	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
she	1
rose.	1
	1
None	1
of	1
them,	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
middle-aged	1
Dimmler,	1
wanted	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
their	1
conversation	1
and	1
quit	1
that	1
corner	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
but	1
Natasha	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
Standing	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
choosing	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
resonance	1
was	1
best,	1
Natasha	1
began	1
to	1
sing	1
her	1
mother's	1
favorite	1
song.	1
	1
She	1
had	1
said	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
sing,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
sung,	1
and	1
long	1
before	1
she	1
again	1
sang,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
that	1
evening.	1
The	1
count,	1
from	1
his	1
study	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Mitenka,	1
heard	1
her	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
run	1
out	1
to	1
play,	1
blundered	1
in	1
his	1
talk	1
while	1
giving	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
steward,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
stopped,	1
while	1
Mitenka	1
stood	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
also	1
listening	1
and	1
smiling.	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
drew	1
breath	1
in	1
time	1
with	1
her.	1
Sonya,	1
as	1
she	1
listened,	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
immense	1
difference	1
there	1
was	1
between	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
friend,	1
and	1
how	1
impossible	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
like	1
as	1
bewitching	1
as	1
her	1
cousin.	1
The	1
old	1
countess	1
sat	1
with	1
a	1
blissful	1
yet	1
sad	1
smile	1
and	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
occasionally	1
shaking	1
her	1
head.	1
She	1
thought	1
of	1
Natasha	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
youth,	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
unnatural	1
and	1
dreadful	1
in	1
this	1
impending	1
marriage	1
of	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Dimmler,	1
who	1
had	1
seated	1
himself	1
beside	1
the	1
countess,	1
listened	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Countess,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
"that's	1
a	1
European	1
talent,	1
she	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
learn--what	1
softness,	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
strength...."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
how	1
afraid	1
I	1
am	1
for	1
her,	1
how	1
afraid	1
I	1
am!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
not	1
realizing	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
speaking.	1
Her	1
maternal	1
instinct	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
Natasha	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
something,	1
and	1
that	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
happy.	1
Before	1
Natasha	1
had	1
finished	1
singing,	1
fourteen-year-old	1
Petya	1
rushed	1
in	1
delightedly,	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
some	1
mummers	1
had	1
arrived.	1
	1
Natasha	1
stopped	1
abruptly.	1
	1
"Idiot!"	1
she	1
screamed	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
and,	1
running	1
to	1
a	1
chair,	1
threw	1
herself	1
on	1
it,	1
sobbing	1
so	1
violently	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
stop	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
"It's	1
nothing,	1
Mamma,	1
really	1
it's	1
nothing;	1
only	1
Petya	1
startled	1
me,"	1
she	1
said,	1
trying	1
to	1
smile,	1
but	1
her	1
tears	1
still	1
flowed	1
and	1
sobs	1
still	1
choked	1
her.	1
	1
The	1
mummers	1
(some	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
serfs)	1
dressed	1
up	1
as	1
bears,	1
Turks,	1
innkeepers,	1
and	1
ladies--frightening	1
and	1
funny--bringing	1
in	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
cold	1
from	1
outside	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
gaiety,	1
crowded,	1
at	1
first	1
timidly,	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
then	1
hiding	1
behind	1
one	1
another	1
they	1
pushed	1
into	1
the	1
ballroom	1
where,	1
shyly	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
merrily	1
and	1
heartily,	1
they	1
started	1
singing,	1
dancing,	1
and	1
playing	1
Christmas	1
games.	1
The	1
countess,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
identified	1
them	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
their	1
costumes,	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
count	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
smiling	1
radiantly	1
and	1
applauding	1
the	1
players.	1
The	1
young	1
people	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
there	1
appeared	1
among	1
the	1
other	1
mummers	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
an	1
old	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
hooped	1
skirt--this	1
was	1
Nicholas.	1
A	1
Turkish	1
girl	1
was	1
Petya.	1
A	1
clown	1
was	1
Dimmler.	1
An	1
hussar	1
was	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
a	1
Circassian	1
was	1
Sonya	1
with	1
burnt-cork	1
mustache	1
and	1
eyebrows.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
condescending	1
surprise,	1
nonrecognition,	1
and	1
praise,	1
from	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
themselves	1
dressed	1
up,	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
decided	1
that	1
their	1
costumes	1
were	1
so	1
good	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
shown	1
elsewhere.	1
	1
Nicholas,	1
who,	1
as	1
the	1
roads	1
were	1
in	1
splendid	1
condition,	1
wanted	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
all	1
for	1
a	1
drive	1
in	1
his	1
troyka,	1
proposed	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
them	1
about	1
a	1
dozen	1
of	1
the	1
serf	1
mummers	1
and	1
drive	1
to	1
"Uncle's."	1
	1
"No,	1
why	1
disturb	1
the	1
old	1
fellow?"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
"Besides,	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
room	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
there.	1
If	1
you	1
must	1
go,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Melyukovs'."	1
	1
Melyukova	1
was	1
a	1
widow,	1
who,	1
with	1
her	1
family	1
and	1
their	1
tutors	1
and	1
governesses,	1
lived	1
three	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
	1
"That's	1
right,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
thoroughly	1
aroused.	1
"I'll	1
dress	1
up	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
them.	1
I'll	1
make	1
Pashette	1
open	1
her	1
eyes."	1
	1
But	1
the	1
countess	1
would	1
not	1
agree	1
to	1
his	1
going;	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
bad	1
leg	1
all	1
these	1
last	1
days.	1
It	1
was	1
decided	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
must	1
not	1
go,	1
but	1
that	1
if	1
Louisa	1
Ivanovna	1
(Madame	1
Schoss)	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
them,	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
might	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Melyukovs',	1
Sonya,	1
generally	1
so	1
timid	1
and	1
shy,	1
more	1
urgently	1
than	1
anyone	1
begging	1
Louisa	1
Ivanovna	1
not	1
to	1
refuse.	1
	1
Sonya's	1
costume	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all.	1
Her	1
mustache	1
and	1
eyebrows	1
were	1
extraordinarily	1
becoming.	1
Everyone	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
looked	1
very	1
handsome,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
spirited	1
and	1
energetic	1
mood	1
unusual	1
with	1
her.	1
Some	1
inner	1
voice	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
now	1
or	1
never	1
her	1
fate	1
would	1
be	1
decided,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
male	1
attire	1
she	1
seemed	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
person.	1
Louisa	1
Ivanovna	1
consented	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
four	1
troyka	1
sleighs	1
with	1
large	1
and	1
small	1
bells,	1
their	1
runners	1
squeaking	1
and	1
whistling	1
over	1
the	1
frozen	1
snow,	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
foremost	1
in	1
setting	1
a	1
merry	1
holiday	1
tone,	1
which,	1
passing	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
grew	1
stronger	1
and	1
reached	1
its	1
climax	1
when	1
they	1
all	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
frost	1
and	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
sleighs,	1
talking,	1
calling	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
laughing,	1
and	1
shouting.	1
	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
troykas	1
were	1
the	1
usual	1
household	1
sleighs,	1
the	1
third	1
was	1
the	1
old	1
count's	1
with	1
a	1
trotter	1
from	1
the	1
Orlov	1
stud	1
as	1
shaft	1
horse,	1
the	1
fourth	1
was	1
Nicholas'	1
own	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
shaggy	1
black	1
shaft	1
horse.	1
Nicholas,	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
lady's	1
dress	1
over	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
belted	1
his	1
hussar	1
overcoat,	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
sleigh,	1
reins	1
in	1
hand.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
light	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
moonlight	1
reflected	1
from	1
the	1
metal	1
harness	1
disks	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
horses,	1
who	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
alarm	1
at	1
the	1
noisy	1
party	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
porch	1
roof.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
Sonya,	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
and	1
two	1
maids	1
got	1
into	1
Nicholas'	1
sleigh;	1
Dimmler,	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
Petya,	1
into	1
the	1
old	1
count's,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
mummers	1
seated	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
sleighs.	1
	1
"You	1
go	1
ahead,	1
Zakhar!"	1
shouted	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
coachman,	1
wishing	1
for	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
race	1
past	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
count's	1
troyka,	1
with	1
Dimmler	1
and	1
his	1
party,	1
started	1
forward,	1
squeaking	1
on	1
its	1
runners	1
as	1
though	1
freezing	1
to	1
the	1
snow,	1
its	1
deep-toned	1
bell	1
clanging.	1
The	1
side	1
horses,	1
pressing	1
against	1
the	1
shafts	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
horse,	1
sank	1
in	1
the	1
snow,	1
which	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
glittered	1
like	1
sugar,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
set	1
off,	1
following	1
the	1
first	1
sleigh;	1
behind	1
him	1
the	1
others	1
moved	1
noisily,	1
their	1
runners	1
squeaking.	1
At	1
first	1
they	1
drove	1
at	1
a	1
steady	1
trot	1
along	1
the	1
narrow	1
road.	1
While	1
they	1
drove	1
past	1
the	1
garden	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
bare	1
trees	1
often	1
fell	1
across	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
hid	1
the	1
brilliant	1
moonlight,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
past	1
the	1
fence,	1
the	1
snowy	1
plain	1
bathed	1
in	1
moonlight	1
and	1
motionless	1
spread	1
out	1
before	1
them	1
glittering	1
like	1
diamonds	1
and	1
dappled	1
with	1
bluish	1
shadows.	1
Bang,	1
bang!	1
went	1
the	1
first	1
sleigh	1
over	1
a	1
cradle	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
sleighs	1
jolted	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
and	1
rudely	1
breaking	1
the	1
frost-	1
bound	1
stillness,	1
the	1
troykas	1
began	1
to	1
speed	1
along	1
the	1
road,	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"A	1
hare's	1
track,	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
tracks!"	1
rang	1
out	1
Natasha's	1
voice	1
through	1
the	1
frost-bound	1
air.	1
	1
"How	1
light	1
it	1
is,	1
Nicholas!"	1
came	1
Sonya's	1
voice.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
bent	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
face	1
closer.	1
Quite	1
a	1
new,	1
sweet	1
face	1
with	1
black	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
mustaches	1
peeped	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
her	1
sable	1
furs--so	1
close	1
and	1
yet	1
so	1
distant--in	1
the	1
moonlight.	1
	1
"That	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
Sonya,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
closer	1
and	1
smiled.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
Nicholas?"	1
	1
"Nothing,"	1
said	1
he	1
and	1
turned	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
horses.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
beaten	1
highroad--polished	1
by	1
sleigh	1
runners	1
and	1
cut	1
up	1
by	1
rough-shod	1
hoofs,	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight--the	1
horses	1
began	1
to	1
tug	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord	1
and	1
increased	1
their	1
pace.	1
The	1
near	1
side	1
horse,	1
arching	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
breaking	1
into	1
a	1
short	1
canter,	1
tugged	1
at	1
his	1
traces.	1
The	1
shaft	1
horse	1
swayed	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
moving	1
his	1
ears	1
as	1
if	1
asking:	1
"Isn't	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
begin	1
now?"	1
In	1
front,	1
already	1
far	1
ahead	1
the	1
deep	1
bell	1
of	1
the	1
sleigh	1
ringing	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
off,	1
the	1
black	1
horses	1
driven	1
by	1
Zakhar	1
could	1
be	1
clearly	1
seen	1
against	1
the	1
white	1
snow.	1
From	1
that	1
sleigh	1
one	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
shouts,	1
laughter,	1
and	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
mummers.	1
	1
"Gee	1
up,	1
my	1
darlings!"	1
shouted	1
Nicholas,	1
pulling	1
the	1
reins	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
flourishing	1
the	1
whip.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
keener	1
wind	1
that	1
met	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
jerks	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
horses	1
who	1
pulled	1
harder--ever	1
increasing	1
their	1
gallop--that	1
one	1
noticed	1
how	1
fast	1
the	1
troyka	1
was	1
flying.	1
Nicholas	1
looked	1
back.	1
With	1
screams	1
squeals,	1
and	1
waving	1
of	1
whips	1
that	1
caused	1
even	1
the	1
shaft	1
horses	1
to	1
gallop--the	1
other	1
sleighs	1
followed.	1
The	1
shaft	1
horse	1
swung	1
steadily	1
beneath	1
the	1
bow	1
over	1
its	1
head,	1
with	1
no	1
thought	1
of	1
slackening	1
pace	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
speed	1
when	1
required.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
overtook	1
the	1
first	1
sleigh.	1
They	1
were	1
driving	1
downhill	1
and	1
coming	1
out	1
upon	1
a	1
broad	1
trodden	1
track	1
across	1
a	1
meadow,	1
near	1
a	1
river.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
we?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"It's	1
the	1
Kosoy	1
meadow,	1
I	1
suppose.	1
But	1
no--	1
this	1
is	1
something	1
new	1
I've	1
never	1
seen	1
before.	1
This	1
isn't	1
the	1
Kosoy	1
meadow	1
nor	1
the	1
Demkin	1
hill,	1
and	1
heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
it	1
is!	1
It	1
is	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
enchanted.	1
Well,	1
whatever	1
it	1
may	1
be..."	1
And	1
shouting	1
to	1
his	1
horses,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
first	1
sleigh.	1
	1
Zakhar	1
held	1
back	1
his	1
horses	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
face,	1
which	1
was	1
already	1
covered	1
with	1
hoarfrost	1
to	1
his	1
eyebrows.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
gave	1
the	1
horses	1
the	1
rein,	1
and	1
Zakhar,	1
stretching	1
out	1
his	1
arms,	1
clucked	1
his	1
tongue	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
horses	1
go.	1
	1
"Now,	1
look	1
out,	1
master!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
Faster	1
still	1
the	1
two	1
troykas	1
flew	1
side	1
by	1
side,	1
and	1
faster	1
moved	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
galloping	1
side	1
horses.	1
Nicholas	1
began	1
to	1
draw	1
ahead.	1
Zakhar,	1
while	1
still	1
keeping	1
his	1
arms	1
extended,	1
raised	1
one	1
hand	1
with	1
the	1
reins.	1
	1
"No	1
you	1
won't,	1
master!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
put	1
all	1
his	1
horses	1
to	1
a	1
gallop	1
and	1
passed	1
Zakhar.	1
The	1
horses	1
showered	1
the	1
fine	1
dry	1
snow	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
sleigh--beside	1
them	1
sounded	1
quick	1
ringing	1
bells	1
and	1
they	1
caught	1
confused	1
glimpses	1
of	1
swiftly	1
moving	1
legs	1
and	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
troyka	1
they	1
were	1
passing.	1
The	1
whistling	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
runners	1
on	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
girls	1
shrieking	1
were	1
heard	1
from	1
different	1
sides.	1
	1
Again	1
checking	1
his	1
horses,	1
Nicholas	1
looked	1
around	1
him.	1
They	1
were	1
still	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
magic	1
plain	1
bathed	1
in	1
moonlight	1
and	1
spangled	1
with	1
stars.	1
	1
"Zakhar	1
is	1
shouting	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
but	1
why	1
to	1
the	1
left?"	1
thought	1
Nicholas.	1
"Are	1
we	1
getting	1
to	1
the	1
Melyukovs'?	1
Is	1
this	1
Melyukovka?	1
Heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
going,	1
and	1
heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
is	1
happening	1
to	1
us--but	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
strange	1
and	1
pleasant	1
whatever	1
it	1
is."	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
sleigh.	1
	1
"Look,	1
his	1
mustache	1
and	1
eyelashes	1
are	1
all	1
white!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
strange,	1
pretty,	1
unfamiliar	1
people--the	1
one	1
with	1
fine	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
mustache.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
this	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
Natasha,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
"and	1
that	1
was	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
it's	1
not,	1
and	1
this	1
Circassian	1
with	1
the	1
mustache	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
but	1
I	1
love	1
her."	1
	1
"Aren't	1
you	1
cold?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
but	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
Dimmler	1
from	1
the	1
sleigh	1
behind	1
shouted	1
something--probably	1
something	1
funny--but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes!"	1
some	1
voices	1
answered,	1
laughing.	1
	1
"But	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
fairy	1
forest	1
with	1
black	1
moving	1
shadows,	1
and	1
a	1
glitter	1
of	1
diamonds	1
and	1
a	1
flight	1
of	1
marble	1
steps	1
and	1
the	1
silver	1
roofs	1
of	1
fairy	1
buildings	1
and	1
the	1
shrill	1
yells	1
of	1
some	1
animals.	1
And	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
really	1
Melyukovka,	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
stranger	1
that	1
we	1
drove	1
heaven	1
knows	1
where	1
and	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
Melyukovka,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
It	1
really	1
was	1
Melyukovka,	1
and	1
maids	1
and	1
footmen	1
with	1
merry	1
faces	1
came	1
running,	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
carrying	1
candles.	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
someone	1
in	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
"The	1
mummers	1
from	1
the	1
count's.	1
I	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
horses,"	1
replied	1
some	1
voices.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Pelageya	1
Danilovna	1
Melyukova,	1
a	1
broadly	1
built,	1
energetic	1
woman	1
wearing	1
spectacles,	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
in	1
a	1
loose	1
dress,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
her	1
daughters	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
keep	1
from	1
feeling	1
dull.	1
They	1
were	1
quietly	1
dropping	1
melted	1
wax	1
into	1
snow	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
shadows	1
the	1
wax	1
figures	1
would	1
throw	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
voices	1
of	1
new	1
arrivals	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule.	1
	1
Hussars,	1
ladies,	1
witches,	1
clowns,	1
and	1
bears,	1
after	1
clearing	1
their	1
throats	1
and	1
wiping	1
the	1
hoarfrost	1
from	1
their	1
faces	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule,	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
ballroom	1
where	1
candles	1
were	1
hurriedly	1
lighted.	1
The	1
clown--	1
Dimmler--and	1
the	1
lady--Nicholas--started	1
a	1
dance.	1
Surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
screaming	1
children	1
the	1
mummers,	1
covering	1
their	1
faces	1
and	1
disguising	1
their	1
voices,	1
bowed	1
to	1
their	1
hostess	1
and	1
arranged	1
themselves	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1

"Dear	1
me!	1
there's	1
no	1
recognizing	1
them!	1
And	1
Natasha!	1
See	1
whom	1
she	1
looks	1
like!	1
She	1
really	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
somebody.	1
But	1
Herr	1
Dimmler--isn't	1
he	1
good!	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
him!	1
And	1
how	1
he	1
dances.	1
Dear	1
me,	1
there's	1
a	1
Circassian.	1
Really,	1
how	1
becoming	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
dear	1
Sonya.	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
that?	1
Well,	1
you	1
have	1
cheered	1
us	1
up!	1
Nikita	1
and	1
Vanya--clear	1
away	1
the	1
tables!	1
And	1
we	1
were	1
sitting	1
so	1
quietly.	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!...	1
The	1
hussar,	1
the	1
hussar!	1
Just	1
like	1
a	1
boy!	1
And	1
the	1
legs!...	1
I	1
can't	1
look	1
at	1
him..."	1
different	1
voices	1
were	1
saying.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
the	1
young	1
Melyukovs'	1
favorite,	1
disappeared	1
with	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
back	1
rooms	1
where	1
a	1
cork	1
and	1
various	1
dressing	1
gowns	1
and	1
male	1
garments	1
were	1
called	1
for	1
and	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
footman	1
by	1
bare	1
girlish	1
arms	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
door.	1
Ten	1
minutes	1
later,	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
Melyukovs	1
joined	1
the	1
mummers.	1
	1
Pelageya	1
Danilovna,	1
having	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
rooms	1
for	1
the	1
visitors	1
and	1
arranged	1
about	1
refreshments	1
for	1
the	1
gentry	1
and	1
the	1
serfs,	1
went	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
mummers	1
without	1
removing	1
her	1
spectacles,	1
peering	1
into	1
their	1
faces	1
with	1
a	1
suppressed	1
smile	1
and	1
failing	1
to	1
recognize	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
Dimmler	1
and	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
she	1
failed	1
to	1
recognize,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
recognize	1
her	1
own	1
daughters,	1
or	1
her	1
late	1
husband's,	1
dressing	1
gowns	1
and	1
uniforms,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
put	1
on.	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
this?"	1
she	1
asked	1
her	1
governess,	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
daughter	1
dressed	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
Kazan-Tartar.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs!	1
Well,	1
Mr.	1
Hussar,	1
and	1
what	1
regiment	1
do	1
you	1
serve	1
in?"	1
she	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
"Here,	1
hand	1
some	1
fruit	1
jelly	1
to	1
the	1
Turk!"	1
she	1
ordered	1
the	1
butler	1
who	1
was	1
handing	1
things	1
round.	1
"That's	1
not	1
forbidden	1
by	1
his	1
law."	1
	1
Sometimes,	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
but	1
amusing	1
capers	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
dancers,	1
who--having	1
decided	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
being	1
disguised,	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
recognize	1
them--were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
shy,	1
Pelageya	1
Danilovna	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
stout	1
body	1
shook	1
with	1
irrepressible,	1
kindly,	1
elderly	1
laughter.	1
	1
"My	1
little	1
Sasha!	1
Look	1
at	1
Sasha!"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
After	1
Russian	1
country	1
dances	1
and	1
chorus	1
dances,	1
Pelageya	1
Danilovna	1
made	1
the	1
serfs	1
and	1
gentry	1
join	1
in	1
one	1
large	1
circle:	1
a	1
ring,	1
a	1
string,	1
and	1
a	1
silver	1
ruble	1
were	1
fetched	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
played	1
games	1
together.	1
	1
In	1
an	1
hour,	1
all	1
the	1
costumes	1
were	1
crumpled	1
and	1
disordered.	1
The	1
corked	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
mustaches	1
were	1
smeared	1
over	1
the	1
perspiring,	1
flushed,	1
and	1
merry	1
faces.	1
Pelageya	1
Danilovna	1
began	1
to	1
recognize	1
the	1
mummers,	1
admired	1
their	1
cleverly	1
contrived	1
costumes,	1
and	1
particularly	1
how	1
they	1
suited	1
the	1
young	1
ladies,	1
and	1
she	1
thanked	1
them	1
all	1
for	1
having	1
entertained	1
her	1
so	1
well.	1
The	1
visitors	1
were	1
invited	1
to	1
supper	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
and	1
the	1
serfs	1
had	1
something	1
served	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
	1
"Now	1
to	1
tell	1
one's	1
fortune	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1
bathhouse	1
is	1
frightening!"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
maid	1
who	1
lived	1
with	1
the	1
Melyukovs,	1
during	1
supper.	1
	1
"Why?"	1
said	1
the	1
eldest	1
Melyukov	1
girl.	1
	1
"You	1
wouldn't	1
go,	1
it	1
takes	1
courage..."	1
	1
"I'll	1
go,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Tell	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
lady!"	1
said	1
the	1
second	1
Melyukov	1
girl.	1
	1
"Well,"	1
began	1
the	1
old	1
maid,	1
"a	1
young	1
lady	1
once	1
went	1
out,	1
took	1
a	1
cock,	1
laid	1
the	1
table	1
for	1
two,	1
all	1
properly,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
After	1
sitting	1
a	1
while,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
hears	1
someone	1
coming...	1
a	1
sleigh	1
drives	1
up	1
with	1
harness	1
bells;	1
she	1
hears	1
him	1
coming!	1
He	1
comes	1
in,	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
like	1
an	1
officer--comes	1
in	1
and	1
sits	1
down	1
to	1
table	1
with	1
her."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
ah!"	1
screamed	1
Natasha,	1
rolling	1
her	1
eyes	1
with	1
horror.	1
	1
"Yes?	1
And	1
how...	1
did	1
he	1
speak?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
like	1
a	1
man.	1
Everything	1
quite	1
all	1
right,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
persuading	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
kept	1
him	1
talking	1
till	1
cockcrow,	1
but	1
she	1
got	1
frightened,	1
just	1
got	1
frightened	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands.	1
Then	1
he	1
caught	1
her	1
up.	1
It	1
was	1
lucky	1
the	1
maids	1
ran	1
in	1
just	1
then..."	1
	1
"Now,	1
why	1
frighten	1
them?"	1
said	1
Pelageya	1
Danilovna.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
try	1
your	1
fate	1
yourself..."	1
said	1
her	1
daughter.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
does	1
one	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
barn?"	1
inquired	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Well,	1
say	1
you	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
barn	1
now,	1
and	1
listened.	1
It	1
depends	1
on	1
what	1
you	1
hear;	1
hammering	1
and	1
knocking--that's	1
bad;	1
but	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
shifting	1
grain	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
one	1
sometimes	1
hears	1
that,	1
too."	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
tell	1
us	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
barn."	1
	1
Pelageya	1
Danilovna	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I've	1
forgotten..."	1
she	1
replied.	1
"But	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
would	1
go?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
will;	1
Pelageya	1
Danilovna,	1
let	1
me!	1
I'll	1
go,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Well,	1
why	1
not,	1
if	1
you're	1
not	1
afraid?"	1
	1
"Louisa	1
Ivanovna,	1
may	1
I?"	1
asked	1
Sonya.	1
	1
Whether	1
they	1
were	1
playing	1
the	1
ring	1
and	1
string	1
game	1
or	1
the	1
ruble	1
game	1
or	1
talking	1
as	1
now,	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
Sonya's	1
side,	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
quite	1
new	1
eyes.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
today,	1
thanks	1
to	1
that	1
burnt-cork	1
mustache,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
fully	1
learned	1
to	1
know	1
her.	1
And	1
really,	1
that	1
evening,	1
Sonya	1
was	1
brighter,	1
more	1
animated,	1
and	1
prettier	1
than	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
her	1
before.	1
	1
"So	1
that's	1
what	1
she	1
is	1
like;	1
what	1
a	1
fool	1
I	1
have	1
been!"	1
he	1
thought	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
sparkling	1
eyes,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
mustache	1
a	1
happy	1
rapturous	1
smile	1
dimpled	1
her	1
cheeks,	1
a	1
smile	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before.	1
	1
"I'm	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
anything,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
"May	1
I	1
go	1
at	1
once?"	1
She	1
got	1
up.	1
	1
They	1
told	1
her	1
where	1
the	1
barn	1
was	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
should	1
stand	1
and	1
listen,	1
and	1
they	1
handed	1
her	1
a	1
fur	1
cloak.	1
She	1
threw	1
this	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
shoulders	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
darling	1
that	1
girl	1
is!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"And	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
till	1
now?"	1
	1
Sonya	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
barn.	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
hastily	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
porch,	1
saying	1
he	1
felt	1
too	1
hot.	1
The	1
crowd	1
of	1
people	1
really	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
house	1
stuffy.	1
	1
Outside,	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
cold	1
stillness	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
moon,	1
but	1
even	1
brighter	1
than	1
before.	1
The	1
light	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
and	1
the	1
snow	1
sparkled	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
stars	1
that	1
one	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
the	1
real	1
stars	1
were	1
unnoticed.	1
The	1
sky	1
was	1
black	1
and	1
dreary,	1
while	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
gay.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
fool,	1
a	1
fool!	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
waiting	1
for?"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
running	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
porch	1
he	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
porch.	1
He	1
knew	1
Sonya	1
would	1
pass	1
that	1
way.	1
Halfway	1
lay	1
some	1
snow-covered	1
piles	1
of	1
firewood	1
and	1
across	1
and	1
along	1
them	1
a	1
network	1
of	1
shadows	1
from	1
the	1
bare	1
old	1
lime	1
trees	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
path.	1
This	1
path	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
barn.	1
The	1
log	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
barn	1
and	1
its	1
snow-covered	1
roof,	1
that	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
hewn	1
out	1
of	1
some	1
precious	1
stone,	1
sparkled	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight.	1
A	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
snapped	1
with	1
the	1
frost,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
was	1
again	1
perfectly	1
silent.	1
His	1
bosom	1
seemed	1
to	1
inhale	1
not	1
air	1
but	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
eternal	1
youth	1
and	1
gladness.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
back	1
porch	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
feet	1
descending	1
the	1
steps,	1
the	1
bottom	1
step	1
upon	1
which	1
snow	1
had	1
fallen	1
gave	1
a	1
ringing	1
creak	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
maidservant	1
saying,	1
"Straight,	1
straight,	1
along	1
the	1
path,	1
Miss.	1
Only,	1
don't	1
look	1
back."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid,"	1
answered	1
Sonya's	1
voice,	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
toward	1
Nicholas	1
came	1
the	1
crunching,	1
whistling	1
sound	1
of	1
Sonya's	1
feet	1
in	1
her	1
thin	1
shoes.	1
	1
Sonya	1
came	1
along,	1
wrapped	1
in	1
her	1
cloak.	1
She	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
paces	1
away	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
too	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
Nicholas	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
and	1
always	1
slightly	1
feared.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
woman's	1
dress,	1
with	1
tousled	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
happy	1
smile	1
new	1
to	1
Sonya.	1
She	1
ran	1
rapidly	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
"Quite	1
different	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
same,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
all	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
moonlight.	1
He	1
slipped	1
his	1
arms	1
under	1
the	1
cloak	1
that	1
covered	1
her	1
head,	1
embraced	1
her,	1
pressed	1
her	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
lips	1
that	1
wore	1
a	1
mustache	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
burnt	1
cork.	1
Sonya	1
kissed	1
him	1
full	1
on	1
the	1
lips,	1
and	1
disengaging	1
her	1
little	1
hands	1
pressed	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
	1
"Sonya!...	1
Nicholas!"...	1
was	1
all	1
they	1
said.	1
They	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
barn	1
and	1
then	1
back	1
again,	1
re-entering,	1
he	1
by	1
the	1
front	1
and	1
she	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
porch.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
When	1
they	1
all	1
drove	1
back	1
from	1
Pelageya	1
Danilovna's,	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
always	1
saw	1
and	1
noticed	1
everything,	1
arranged	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
Madame	1
Schoss	1
should	1
go	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
sleigh	1
with	1
Dimmler,	1
and	1
Sonya	1
with	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
the	1
maids.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
back	1
Nicholas	1
drove	1
at	1
a	1
steady	1
pace	1
instead	1
of	1
racing	1
and	1
kept	1
peering	1
by	1
that	1
fantastic	1
all-transforming	1
light	1
into	1
Sonya's	1
face	1
and	1
searching	1
beneath	1
the	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
mustache	1
for	1
his	1
former	1
and	1
his	1
present	1
Sonya	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
resolved	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
again.	1
He	1
looked	1
and	1
recognizing	1
in	1
her	1
both	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
being	1
reminded	1
by	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
burnt	1
cork	1
of	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
her	1
kiss,	1
inhaled	1
the	1
frosty	1
air	1
with	1
a	1
full	1
breast	1
and,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
ground	1
flying	1
beneath	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
sparkling	1
sky,	1
felt	1
himself	1
again	1
in	1
fairyland.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
is	1
it	1
well	1
with	1
thee?"	1
he	1
asked	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time.	1
	1
"Yes!"	1
she	1
replied.	1
"And	1
with	1
thee?"	1
	1
When	1
halfway	1
home	1
Nicholas	1
handed	1
the	1
reins	1
to	1
the	1
coachman	1
and	1
ran	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
sleigh	1
and	1
stood	1
on	1
its	1
wing.	1
	1
"Natasha!"	1
he	1
whispered	1
in	1
French,	1
"do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
about	1
Sonya?"	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
told	1
her?"	1
asked	1
Natasha,	1
suddenly	1
beaming	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
strange	1
you	1
are	1
with	1
that	1
mustache	1
and	1
those	1
eyebrows!...	1
Natasha--are	1
you	1
glad?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
glad,	1
so	1
glad!	1
I	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
vexed	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
treating	1
her	1
badly.	1
What	1
a	1
heart	1
she	1
has,	1
Nicholas!	1
I	1
am	1
horrid	1
sometimes,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
while	1
Sonya	1
was	1
not,"	1
continued	1
Natasha.	1
"Now	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
glad!	1
Well,	1
run	1
back	1
to	1
her."	1
	1
"No,	1
wait	1
a	1
bit....	1
Oh,	1
how	1
funny	1
you	1
look!"	1
cried	1
Nicholas,	1
peering	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
finding	1
in	1
his	1
sister	1
too	1
something	1
new,	1
unusual,	1
and	1
bewitchingly	1
tender	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
before.	1
"Natasha,	1
it's	1
magical,	1
isn't	1
it?"	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
she	1
replied.	1
"You	1
have	1
done	1
splendidly."	1
	1
"Had	1
I	1
seen	1
her	1
before	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
now,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
"I	1
should	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
whatever	1
she	1
told	1
me,	1
and	1
all	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
well."	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
glad	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
right?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
quite	1
right!	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
quarrel	1
with	1
Mamma	1
some	1
time	1
ago	1
about	1
it.	1
Mamma	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
angling	1
for	1
you.	1
How	1
could	1
she	1
say	1
such	1
a	1
thing!	1
I	1
nearly	1
stormed	1
at	1
Mamma.	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
let	1
anyone	1
say	1
anything	1
bad	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
good	1
in	1
her."	1
	1
"Then	1
it's	1
all	1
right?"	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
again	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
sister's	1
face	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
earnest.	1
Then	1
he	1
jumped	1
down	1
and,	1
his	1
boots	1
scrunching	1
the	1
snow,	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
sleigh.	1
The	1
same	1
happy,	1
smiling	1
Circassian,	1
with	1
mustache	1
and	1
beaming	1
eyes	1
looking	1
up	1
from	1
under	1
a	1
sable	1
hood,	1
was	1
still	1
sitting	1
there,	1
and	1
that	1
Circassian	1
was	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
certainly	1
his	1
future	1
happy	1
and	1
loving	1
wife.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
home	1
and	1
had	1
told	1
their	1
mother	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
Melyukovs',	1
the	1
girls	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
bedroom.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
undressed,	1
but	1
without	1
washing	1
off	1
the	1
cork	1
mustaches,	1
they	1
sat	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
talking	1
of	1
their	1
happiness.	1
They	1
talked	1
of	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
live	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
married,	1
how	1
their	1
husbands	1
would	1
be	1
friends,	1
and	1
how	1
happy	1
they	1
would	1
be.	1
On	1
Natasha's	1
table	1
stood	1
two	1
looking	1
glasses	1
which	1
Dunyasha	1
had	1
prepared	1
beforehand.	1
	1
"Only	1
when	1
will	1
all	1
that	1
be?	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
never....	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
good!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
rising	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
looking	1
glasses.	1
	1
"Sit	1
down,	1
Natasha;	1
perhaps	1
you'll	1
see	1
him,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
Natasha	1
lit	1
the	1
candles,	1
one	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
looking	1
glasses,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
someone	1
with	1
a	1
mustache,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
seeing	1
her	1
own	1
face.	1
	1
"You	1
mustn't	1
laugh,	1
Miss,"	1
said	1
Dunyasha.	1
	1
With	1
Sonya's	1
help	1
and	1
the	1
maid's,	1
Natasha	1
got	1
the	1
glass	1
she	1
held	1
into	1
the	1
right	1
position	1
opposite	1
the	1
other;	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
serious	1
expression	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
silent.	1
She	1
sat	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
receding	1
line	1
of	1
candles	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
glasses	1
and	1
expecting	1
(from	1
tales	1
she	1
had	1
heard)	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
coffin,	1
or	1
him,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
in	1
that	1
last	1
dim,	1
indistinctly	1
outlined	1
square.	1
But	1
ready	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
smallest	1
speck	1
for	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
of	1
a	1
coffin,	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing.	1
She	1
began	1
blinking	1
rapidly	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
looking	1
glasses.	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
others	1
see	1
things	1
and	1
I	1
don't?"	1
she	1
said.	1
"You	1
sit	1
down	1
now,	1
Sonya.	1
You	1
absolutely	1
must,	1
tonight!	1
Do	1
it	1
for	1
me....	1
Today	1
I	1
feel	1
so	1
frightened!"	1
	1
Sonya	1
sat	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
glasses,	1
got	1
the	1
right	1
position,	1
and	1
began	1
looking.	1
	1
"Now,	1
Miss	1
Sonya	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
see	1
something,"	1
whispered	1
Dunyasha;	1
"while	1
you	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
laugh."	1
	1
Sonya	1
heard	1
this	1
and	1
Natasha's	1
whisper:	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
she	1
will.	1
She	1
saw	1
something	1
last	1
year."	1
	1
For	1
about	1
three	1
minutes	1
all	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
she	1
will!"	1
whispered	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
finish...	1
suddenly	1
Sonya	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
glass	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
and	1
covered	1
her	1
eyes	1
with	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Natasha!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
see?	1
Did	1
you?	1
What	1
was	1
it?"	1
exclaimed	1
Natasha,	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
looking	1
glass.	1
	1
Sonya	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
anything,	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
wanting	1
to	1
blink	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
Natasha	1
say,	1
"Of	1
course	1
she	1
will!"	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
disappoint	1
either	1
Dunyasha	1
or	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
sit	1
still.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
herself	1
know	1
how	1
or	1
why	1
the	1
exclamation	1
escaped	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
covered	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
"You	1
saw	1
him?"	1
urged	1
Natasha,	1
seizing	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Yes.	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit...	1
I...	1
saw	1
him,"	1
Sonya	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying,	1
not	1
yet	1
knowing	1
whom	1
Natasha	1
meant	1
by	1
him,	1
Nicholas	1
or	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
shouldn't	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
saw	1
something?	1
Others	1
do	1
see!	1
Besides	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
whether	1
I	1
saw	1
anything	1
or	1
not?"	1
flashed	1
through	1
Sonya's	1
mind.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
saw	1
him,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"How?	1
Standing	1
or	1
lying?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
saw...	1
At	1
first	1
there	1
was	1
nothing,	1
then	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
lying	1
down."	1
	1
"Andrew	1
lying?	1
Is	1
he	1
ill?"	1
asked	1
Natasha,	1
her	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
friend.	1
	1
"No,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary!	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
cheerful,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me."	1
And	1
when	1
saying	1
this	1
she	1
herself	1
fancied	1
she	1
had	1
really	1
seen	1
what	1
she	1
described.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
then,	1
Sonya?..."	1
	1
"After	1
that,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
there	1
was;	1
something	1
blue	1
and	1
red..."	1
	1
"Sonya!	1
When	1
will	1
he	1
come	1
back?	1
When	1
shall	1
I	1
see	1
him!	1
O,	1
God,	1
how	1
afraid	1
I	1
am	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
about	1
everything!..."	1
Natasha	1
began,	1
and	1
without	1
replying	1
to	1
Sonya's	1
words	1
of	1
comfort	1
she	1
got	1
into	1
bed,	1
and	1
long	1
after	1
her	1
candle	1
was	1
out	1
lay	1
open-eyed	1
and	1
motionless,	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
moonlight	1
through	1
the	1
frosty	1
windowpanes.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
the	1
Christmas	1
holidays	1
Nicholas	1
told	1
his	1
mother	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
Sonya	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
firm	1
resolve	1
to	1
marry	1
her.	1
The	1
countess,	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
noticed	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
was	1
expecting	1
this	1
declaration,	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
then	1
told	1
her	1
son	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
marry	1
whom	1
he	1
pleased,	1
but	1
that	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
give	1
their	1
blessing	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
marriage.	1
Nicholas,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
displeased	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
that,	1
despite	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
him,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
way.	1
Coldly,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
son,	1
she	1
sent	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
and,	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
tried	1
briefly	1
and	1
coldly	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
facts,	1
in	1
her	1
son's	1
presence,	1
but	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
herself	1
she	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
of	1
vexation	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
began	1
irresolutely	1
to	1
admonish	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
beg	1
him	1
to	1
abandon	1
his	1
purpose.	1
Nicholas	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
word,	1
and	1
his	1
father,	1
sighing	1
and	1
evidently	1
disconcerted,	1
very	1
soon	1
became	1
silent	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
countess.	1
In	1
all	1
his	1
encounters	1
with	1
his	1
son,	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
always	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
guilt	1
toward	1
him	1
for	1
having	1
wasted	1
the	1
family	1
fortune,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
refusing	1
to	1
marry	1
an	1
heiress	1
and	1
choosing	1
the	1
dowerless	1
Sonya.	1
On	1
this	1
occasion,	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
more	1
vividly	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
if	1
his	1
affairs	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
disorder,	1
no	1
better	1
wife	1
for	1
Nicholas	1
than	1
Sonya	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
wished	1
for,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
Mitenka	1
and	1
his	1
uncomfortable	1
habits	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
finances.	1
	1
The	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
their	1
son	1
again,	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
the	1
countess	1
sent	1
for	1
Sonya	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
cruelty	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
expected,	1
reproached	1
her	1
niece	1
for	1
trying	1
to	1
catch	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
for	1
ingratitude.	1
Sonya	1
listened	1
silently	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
countess'	1
cruel	1
words,	1
without	1
understanding	1
what	1
was	1
required	1
of	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
everything	1
for	1
her	1
benefactors.	1
Self-	1
sacrifice	1
was	1
her	1
most	1
cherished	1
idea	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
sacrifice,	1
or	1
for	1
whom.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
loving	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
Rostov	1
family,	1
but	1
neither	1
could	1
she	1
help	1
loving	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
his	1
happiness	1
depended	1
on	1
that	1
love.	1
She	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
sad	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
the	1
situation	1
to	1
be	1
intolerable	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
explanation	1
with	1
his	1
mother.	1
He	1
first	1
implored	1
her	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
and	1
Sonya	1
and	1
consent	1
to	1
their	1
marriage,	1
then	1
he	1
threatened	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
molested	1
Sonya	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
marry	1
her	1
secretly.	1
	1
The	1
countess,	1
with	1
a	1
coldness	1
her	1
son	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
before,	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
age,	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
marrying	1
without	1
his	1
father's	1
consent,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
receive	1
that	1
intriguer	1
as	1
her	1
daughter.	1
	1
Exploding	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
intriguer,	1
Nicholas,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice,	1
told	1
his	1
mother	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
expected	1
her	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
force	1
him	1
to	1
sell	1
his	1
feelings,	1
but	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
so,	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time....	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
decisive	1
word	1
which	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
caused	1
his	1
mother	1
to	1
await	1
with	1
terror,	1
and	1
which	1
would	1
perhaps	1
have	1
forever	1
remained	1
a	1
cruel	1
memory	1
to	1
them	1
both.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
it,	1
for	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
and	1
set	1
face,	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
listening.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
nonsense!	1
Be	1
quiet,	1
be	1
quiet,	1
be	1
quiet,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!..."	1
she	1
almost	1
screamed,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
drown	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"Mamma	1
darling,	1
it's	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
so...	1
my	1
poor,	1
sweet	1
darling,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
who	1
conscious	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
a	1
rupture	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
son	1
with	1
terror,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
obstinacy	1
and	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
conflict	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
way.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
I'll	1
explain	1
to	1
you.	1
Go	1
away!	1
Listen,	1
Mamma	1
darling,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Her	1
words	1
were	1
incoherent,	1
but	1
they	1
attained	1
the	1
purpose	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
aiming.	1
	1
The	1
countess,	1
sobbing	1
heavily,	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
on	1
her	1
daughter's	1
breast,	1
while	1
Nicholas	1
rose,	1
clutching	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Natasha	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
reconciliation,	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
succeeded	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
received	1
a	1
promise	1
from	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
Sonya	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
troubled,	1
while	1
he	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
promised	1
not	1
to	1
undertake	1
anything	1
without	1
his	1
parents'	1
knowledge.	1
	1
Firmly	1
resolved,	1
after	1
putting	1
his	1
affairs	1
in	1
order	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
return	1
and	1
marry	1
Sonya,	1
Nicholas,	1
serious,	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
at	1
variance	1
with	1
his	1
parents,	1
but,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
passionately	1
in	1
love,	1
left	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
January	1
to	1
rejoin	1
his	1
regiment.	1
	1
After	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
gone	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
Rostov	1
household	1
were	1
more	1
depressing	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
fell	1
ill	1
from	1
mental	1
agitation.	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
unhappy	1
at	1
the	1
separation	1
from	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
hostile	1
tone	1
the	1
countess	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
adopting	1
toward	1
her.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
more	1
perturbed	1
than	1
ever	1
by	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
his	1
affairs,	1
which	1
called	1
for	1
some	1
decisive	1
action.	1
Their	1
town	1
house	1
and	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow	1
had	1
inevitably	1
to	1
be	1
sold,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
But	1
the	1
countess'	1
health	1
obliged	1
them	1
to	1
delay	1
their	1
departure	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
had	1
borne	1
the	1
first	1
period	1
of	1
separation	1
from	1
her	1
betrothed	1
lightly	1
and	1
even	1
cheerfully,	1
now	1
grew	1
more	1
agitated	1
and	1
impatient	1
every	1
day.	1
The	1
thought	1
that	1
her	1
best	1
days,	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
employed	1
in	1
loving	1
him,	1
were	1
being	1
vainly	1
wasted,	1
with	1
no	1
advantage	1
to	1
anyone,	1
tormented	1
her	1
incessantly.	1
His	1
letters	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
irritated	1
her.	1
It	1
hurt	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
while	1
she	1
lived	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
a	1
real	1
life,	1
seeing	1
new	1
places	1
and	1
new	1
people	1
that	1
interested	1
him.	1
The	1
more	1
interesting	1
his	1
letters	1
were	1
the	1
more	1
vexed	1
she	1
felt.	1
Her	1
letters	1
to	1
him,	1
far	1
from	1
giving	1
her	1
any	1
comfort,	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
wearisome	1
and	1
artificial	1
obligation.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
write,	1
because	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
expressing	1
sincerely	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
even	1
a	1
thousandth	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
expressed	1
by	1
voice,	1
smile,	1
and	1
glance.	1
She	1
wrote	1
to	1
him	1
formal,	1
monotonous,	1
and	1
dry	1
letters,	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
attached	1
no	1
importance	1
herself,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
rough	1
copies	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
countess	1
corrected	1
her	1
mistakes	1
in	1
spelling.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
still	1
no	1
improvement	1
in	1
the	1
countess'	1
health,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
defer	1
the	1
journey	1
to	1
Moscow	1
any	1
longer.	1
Natasha's	1
trousseau	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
ordered	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
sold.	1
Moreover,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
expected	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
where	1
old	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
spending	1
the	1
winter,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
felt	1
sure	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
arrived.	1
	1
So	1
the	1
countess	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
the	1
count,	1
taking	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
with	1
him,	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
January.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
After	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
engagement	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
Pierre	1
without	1
any	1
apparent	1
cause	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
as	1
before.	1
Firmly	1
convinced	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
truths	1
revealed	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
benefactor,	1
and	1
happy	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
perfecting	1
his	1
inner	1
man,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
devoted	1
himself	1
with	1
such	1
ardor--all	1
the	1
zest	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
life	1
vanished	1
after	1
the	1
engagement	1
of	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Natasha	1
and	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich,	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
which	1
reached	1
him	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
Only	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
life	1
remained:	1
his	1
house,	1
a	1
brilliant	1
wife	1
who	1
now	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
favors	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
personage,	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
all	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
his	1
court	1
service	1
with	1
its	1
dull	1
formalities.	1
And	1
this	1
life	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
unexpectedly	1
loathsome.	1
He	1
ceased	1
keeping	1
a	1
diary,	1
avoided	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
Brothers,	1
began	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
again,	1
drank	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
and	1
came	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
bachelor	1
sets,	1
leading	1
such	1
a	1
life	1
that	1
the	1
Countess	1
Helene	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
speak	1
severely	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
right,	1
and	1
to	1
avoid	1
compromising	1
her	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
In	1
Moscow	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
his	1
huge	1
house	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
faded	1
and	1
fading	1
princesses	1
still	1
lived,	1
with	1
its	1
enormous	1
retinue;	1
as	1
soon	1
as,	1
driving	1
through	1
the	1
town,	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
Iberian	1
shrine	1
with	1
innumerable	1
tapers	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
golden	1
covers	1
of	1
the	1
icons,	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
Square	1
with	1
its	1
snow	1
undisturbed	1
by	1
vehicles,	1
the	1
sleigh	1
drivers	1
and	1
hovels	1
of	1
the	1
Sivtsev	1
Vrazhok,	1
those	1
old	1
Moscovites	1
who	1
desired	1
nothing,	1
hurried	1
nowhere,	1
and	1
were	1
ending	1
their	1
days	1
leisurely;	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
those	1
old	1
Moscow	1
ladies,	1
the	1
Moscow	1
balls,	1
and	1
the	1
English	1
Club,	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
haven.	1
In	1
Moscow	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
peace,	1
at	1
home,	1
warm	1
and	1
dirty	1
as	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
dressing	1
gown.	1
	1
Moscow	1
society,	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
women	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
children,	1
received	1
Pierre	1
like	1
a	1
long-expected	1
guest	1
whose	1
place	1
was	1
always	1
ready	1
awaiting	1
him.	1
For	1
Moscow	1
society	1
Pierre	1
was	1
the	1
nicest,	1
kindest,	1
most	1
intellectual,	1
merriest,	1
and	1
most	1
magnanimous	1
of	1
cranks,	1
a	1
heedless,	1
genial	1
nobleman	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Russian	1
type.	1
His	1
purse	1
was	1
always	1
empty	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
open	1
to	1
everyone.	1
	1
Benefit	1
performances,	1
poor	1
pictures,	1
statues,	1
benevolent	1
societies,	1
gypsy	1
choirs,	1
schools,	1
subscription	1
dinners,	1
sprees,	1
Freemasons,	1
churches,	1
and	1
books--no	1
one	1
and	1
nothing	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
refusal	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
two	1
friends	1
who	1
had	1
borrowed	1
large	1
sums	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
taken	1
him	1
under	1
their	1
protection,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
everything	1
away.	1
There	1
was	1
never	1
a	1
dinner	1
or	1
soiree	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
without	1
him.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
sank	1
into	1
his	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
after	1
two	1
bottles	1
of	1
Margaux	1
he	1
was	1
surrounded,	1
and	1
talking,	1
disputing,	1
and	1
joking	1
began.	1
When	1
there	1
were	1
quarrels,	1
his	1
kindly	1
smile	1
and	1
well-timed	1
jests	1
reconciled	1
the	1
antagonists.	1
The	1
masonic	1
dinners	1
were	1
dull	1
and	1
dreary	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
	1
When	1
after	1
a	1
bachelor	1
supper	1
he	1
rose	1
with	1
his	1
amiable	1
and	1
kindly	1
smile,	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
entreaties	1
of	1
the	1
festive	1
company	1
to	1
drive	1
off	1
somewhere	1
with	1
them,	1
shouts	1
of	1
delight	1
and	1
triumph	1
arose	1
among	1
the	1
young	1
men.	1
At	1
balls	1
he	1
danced	1
if	1
a	1
partner	1
was	1
needed.	1
Young	1
ladies,	1
married	1
and	1
unmarried,	1
liked	1
him	1
because	1
without	1
making	1
love	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
he	1
was	1
equally	1
amiable	1
to	1
all,	1
especially	1
after	1
supper.	1
"Il	1
est	1
charmant;	1
il	1
n'a	1
pas	1
de	1
sexe,"	1
*	1
they	1
said	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"He	1
is	1
charming;	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
sex."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
retired	1
gentlemen-in-waiting	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
hundreds	1
good-humoredly	1
ending	1
their	1
days	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
	1
How	1
horrified	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
seven	1
years	1
before,	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
arrived	1
from	1
abroad,	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
seek	1
or	1
plan	1
anything,	1
that	1
his	1
rut	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
shaped,	1
eternally	1
predetermined,	1
and	1
that	1
wriggle	1
as	1
he	1
might,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
what	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
were.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
it!	1
Had	1
he	1
not	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
longed	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
republic	1
in	1
Russia;	1
then	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Napoleon;	1
then	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
philosopher;	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
strategist	1
and	1
the	1
conqueror	1
of	1
Napoleon?	1
Had	1
he	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
possibility	1
of,	1
and	1
passionately	1
desired,	1
the	1
regeneration	1
of	1
the	1
sinful	1
human	1
race,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
progress	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
of	1
perfection?	1
Had	1
he	1
not	1
established	1
schools	1
and	1
hospitals	1
and	1
liberated	1
his	1
serfs?	1
	1
But	1
instead	1
of	1
all	1
that--here	1
he	1
was,	1
the	1
wealthy	1
husband	1
of	1
an	1
unfaithful	1
wife,	1
a	1
retired	1
gentleman-in-waiting,	1
fond	1
of	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
unbuttoned	1
his	1
waistcoat,	1
of	1
abusing	1
the	1
government	1
a	1
bit,	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
English	1
Club,	1
and	1
a	1
universal	1
favorite	1
in	1
Moscow	1
society.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
reconcile	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
same	1
retired	1
Moscow	1
gentlemen-in-waiting	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
despised	1
seven	1
years	1
before.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
consoled	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
living	1
this	1
life	1
temporarily;	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
shocked	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
many,	1
like	1
himself,	1
had	1
entered	1
that	1
life	1
and	1
that	1
club	1
temporarily,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
teeth	1
and	1
hair,	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
left	1
it	1
when	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
tooth	1
or	1
hair	1
remained.	1
	1
In	1
moments	1
of	1
pride,	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
different	1
and	1
distinct	1
from	1
those	1
other	1
retired	1
gentlemen-in-waiting	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
despised:	1
they	1
were	1
empty,	1
stupid,	1
contented	1
fellows,	1
satisfied	1
with	1
their	1
position,	1
"while	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
discontented	1
and	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
mankind.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
all	1
these	1
comrades	1
of	1
mine	1
struggled	1
just	1
like	1
me	1
and	1
sought	1
something	1
new,	1
a	1
path	1
in	1
life	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
and	1
like	1
me	1
were	1
brought	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
circumstances,	1
society,	1
and	1
race--by	1
that	1
elemental	1
force	1
against	1
which	1
man	1
is	1
powerless--to	1
the	1
condition	1
I	1
am	1
in,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
moments	1
of	1
humility;	1
and	1
after	1
living	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
Moscow	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
despised,	1
but	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
fond	1
of,	1
to	1
respect,	1
and	1
to	1
pity	1
his	1
comrades	1
in	1
destiny,	1
as	1
he	1
pitied	1
himself.	1
	1
Pierre	1
no	1
longer	1
suffered	1
moments	1
of	1
despair,	1
hypochondria,	1
and	1
disgust	1
with	1
life,	1
but	1
the	1
malady	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
such	1
acute	1
attacks	1
was	1
driven	1
inwards	1
and	1
never	1
left	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
"What	1
for?	1
Why?	1
What	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world?"	1
he	1
would	1
ask	1
himself	1
in	1
perplexity	1
several	1
times	1
a	1
day,	1
involuntarily	1
beginning	1
to	1
reflect	1
anew	1
on	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
life;	1
but	1
knowing	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
answers	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
book,	1
or	1
hurried	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
or	1
to	1
Apollon	1
Nikolaevich's,	1
to	1
exchange	1
the	1
gossip	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
"Helene,	1
who	1
has	1
never	1
cared	1
for	1
anything	1
but	1
her	1
own	1
body	1
and	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
stupidest	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
world,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"is	1
regarded	1
by	1
people	1
as	1
the	1
acme	1
of	1
intelligence	1
and	1
refinement,	1
and	1
they	1
pay	1
homage	1
to	1
her.	1
Napoleon	1
Bonaparte	1
was	1
despised	1
by	1
all	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
great,	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
wretched	1
comedian	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
wants	1
to	1
offer	1
him	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
an	1
illegal	1
marriage.	1
The	1
Spaniards,	1
through	1
the	1
Catholic	1
clergy,	1
offer	1
praise	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
their	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
French	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
of	1
June,	1
and	1
the	1
French,	1
also	1
through	1
the	1
Catholic	1
clergy,	1
offer	1
praise	1
because	1
on	1
that	1
same	1
fourteenth	1
of	1
June	1
they	1
defeated	1
the	1
Spaniards.	1
My	1
brother	1
Masons	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
everything	1
for	1
their	1
neighbor,	1
but	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
a	1
ruble	1
each	1
to	1
the	1
collections	1
for	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
they	1
intrigue,	1
the	1
Astraea	1
Lodge	1
against	1
the	1
Manna	1
Seekers,	1
and	1
fuss	1
about	1
an	1
authentic	1
Scotch	1
carpet	1
and	1
a	1
charter	1
that	1
nobody	1
needs,	1
and	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
who	1
wrote	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
understand.	1
We	1
all	1
profess	1
the	1
Christian	1
law	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
injuries	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
our	1
neighbors,	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
built	1
in	1
Moscow	1
forty	1
times	1
forty	1
churches--but	1
yesterday	1
a	1
deserter	1
was	1
knouted	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
a	1
minister	1
of	1
that	1
same	1
law	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
forgiveness,	1
a	1
priest,	1
gave	1
the	1
soldier	1
a	1
cross	1
to	1
kiss	1
before	1
his	1
execution."	1
So	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
general	1
deception	1
which	1
everyone	1
accepts,	1
accustomed	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
it,	1
astonished	1
him	1
each	1
time	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
new.	1
"I	1
understand	1
the	1
deception	1
and	1
confusion,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"but	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
see?	1
I	1
have	1
tried,	1
and	1
have	1
always	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
too	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
understand	1
it	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
and	1
only	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
it.	1
So	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so!	1
But	1
I--what	1
is	1
to	1
become	1
of	1
me?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
capacity	1
many	1
men,	1
especially	1
Russians,	1
have	1
of	1
seeing	1
and	1
believing	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth,	1
but	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
evil	1
and	1
falsehood	1
of	1
life	1
too	1
clearly	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
serious	1
part	1
in	1
it.	1
Every	1
sphere	1
of	1
work	1
was	1
connected,	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
with	1
evil	1
and	1
deception.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
be,	1
whatever	1
he	1
engaged	1
in,	1
the	1
evil	1
and	1
falsehood	1
of	1
it	1
repulsed	1
him	1
and	1
blocked	1
every	1
path	1
of	1
activity.	1
Yet	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
occupation.	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
dreadful	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
these	1
insoluble	1
problems,	1
so	1
he	1
abandoned	1
himself	1
to	1
any	1
distraction	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
forget	1
them.	1
He	1
frequented	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
society,	1
drank	1
much,	1
bought	1
pictures,	1
engaged	1
in	1
building,	1
and	1
above	1
all--read.	1
	1
He	1
read,	1
and	1
read	1
everything	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
hand.	1
On	1
coming	1
home,	1
while	1
his	1
valets	1
were	1
still	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
things,	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read.	1
From	1
reading	1
he	1
passed	1
to	1
sleeping,	1
from	1
sleeping	1
to	1
gossip	1
in	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
of	1
the	1
club,	1
from	1
gossip	1
to	1
carousals	1
and	1
women;	1
from	1
carousals	1
back	1
to	1
gossip,	1
reading,	1
and	1
wine.	1
Drinking	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
a	1
physical	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
moral	1
necessity.	1
Though	1
the	1
doctors	1
warned	1
him	1
that	1
with	1
his	1
corpulence	1
wine	1
was	1
dangerous	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
drank	1
a	1
great	1
deal.	1
He	1
was	1
only	1
quite	1
at	1
ease	1
when	1
having	1
poured	1
several	1
glasses	1
of	1
wine	1
mechanically	1
into	1
his	1
large	1
mouth	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
pleasant	1
warmth	1
in	1
his	1
body,	1
an	1
amiability	1
toward	1
all	1
his	1
fellows,	1
and	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
respond	1
superficially	1
to	1
every	1
idea	1
without	1
probing	1
it	1
deeply.	1
Only	1
after	1
emptying	1
a	1
bottle	1
or	1
two	1
did	1
he	1
feel	1
dimly	1
that	1
the	1
terribly	1
tangled	1
skein	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
previously	1
had	1
terrified	1
him	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
dreadful	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
thought.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
conscious	1
of	1
some	1
aspect	1
of	1
that	1
skein,	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
buzzing	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
after	1
dinner	1
or	1
supper	1
he	1
chatted	1
or	1
listened	1
to	1
conversation	1
or	1
read.	1
But	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
wine	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself:	1
"It	1
doesn't	1
matter.	1
I'll	1
get	1
it	1
unraveled.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
solution	1
ready,	1
but	1
have	1
no	1
time	1
now--I'll	1
think	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
later	1
on!"	1
But	1
the	1
later	1
on	1
never	1
came.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
morning,	1
on	1
an	1
empty	1
stomach,	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
questions	1
appeared	1
as	1
insoluble	1
and	1
terrible	1
as	1
ever,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
hastily	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
if	1
anyone	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
glad.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
soldiers	1
in	1
war	1
when	1
entrenched	1
under	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fire,	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do,	1
try	1
hard	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
occupation	1
the	1
more	1
easily	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
danger.	1
To	1
Pierre	1
all	1
men	1
seemed	1
like	1
those	1
soldiers,	1
seeking	1
refuge	1
from	1
life:	1
some	1
in	1
ambition,	1
some	1
in	1
cards,	1
some	1
in	1
framing	1
laws,	1
some	1
in	1
women,	1
some	1
in	1
toys,	1
some	1
in	1
horses,	1
some	1
in	1
politics,	1
some	1
in	1
sport,	1
some	1
in	1
wine,	1
and	1
some	1
in	1
governmental	1
affairs.	1
"Nothing	1
is	1
trivial,	1
and	1
nothing	1
is	1
important,	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same--only	1
to	1
save	1
oneself	1
from	1
it	1
as	1
best	1
one	1
can,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"Only	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
it,	1
that	1
dreadful	1
it!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
winter	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
moved	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
enthusiasm	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
regime	1
had	1
weakened	1
and	1
a	1
patriotic	1
and	1
anti-French	1
tendency	1
prevailed	1
there,	1
and	1
this,	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
past	1
and	1
his	1
intellect	1
and	1
his	1
originality,	1
at	1
once	1
made	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
particular	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
Moscovites	1
and	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
government.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
had	1
aged	1
very	1
much	1
that	1
year.	1
He	1
showed	1
marked	1
signs	1
of	1
senility	1
by	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep,	1
forgetfulness	1
of	1
quite	1
recent	1
events,	1
remembrance	1
of	1
remote	1
ones,	1
and	1
the	1
childish	1
vanity	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
accepted	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
opposition.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
inspired	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
visitors	1
alike	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
respectful	1
veneration--especially	1
of	1
an	1
evening	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
tea	1
in	1
his	1
old-	1
fashioned	1
coat	1
and	1
powdered	1
wig	1
and,	1
aroused	1
by	1
anyone,	1
told	1
his	1
abrupt	1
stories	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
or	1
uttered	1
yet	1
more	1
abrupt	1
and	1
scathing	1
criticisms	1
of	1
the	1
present.	1
For	1
them	1
all,	1
that	1
old-fashioned	1
house	1
with	1
its	1
gigantic	1
mirrors,	1
pre-Revolution	1
furniture,	1
powdered	1
footmen,	1
and	1
the	1
stern	1
shrewd	1
old	1
man	1
(himself	1
a	1
relic	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
century)	1
with	1
his	1
gentle	1
daughter	1
and	1
the	1
pretty	1
Frenchwoman	1
who	1
were	1
reverently	1
devoted	1
to	1
him	1
presented	1
a	1
majestic	1
and	1
agreeable	1
spectacle.	1
But	1
the	1
visitors	1
did	1
not	1
reflect	1
that	1
besides	1
the	1
couple	1
of	1
hours	1
during	1
which	1
they	1
saw	1
their	1
host,	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
twenty-two	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
private	1
and	1
intimate	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
continued.	1
	1
Latterly	1
that	1
private	1
life	1
had	1
become	1
very	1
trying	1
for	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
There	1
in	1
Moscow	1
she	1
was	1
deprived	1
of	1
her	1
greatest	1
pleasures--talks	1
with	1
the	1
pilgrims	1
and	1
the	1
solitude	1
which	1
refreshed	1
her	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills--and	1
she	1
had	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
pleasures	1
of	1
city	1
life.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
society;	1
everyone	1
knew	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
go	1
anywhere	1
without	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
failing	1
health	1
prevented	1
his	1
going	1
out	1
himself,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
invited	1
to	1
dinners	1
and	1
evening	1
parties.	1
She	1
had	1
quite	1
abandoned	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
getting	1
married.	1
She	1
saw	1
the	1
coldness	1
and	1
malevolence	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
received	1
and	1
dismissed	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
possible	1
suitors,	1
who	1
sometimes	1
appeared	1
at	1
their	1
house.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
friends:	1
during	1
this	1
visit	1
to	1
Moscow	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
disappointed	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
nearest	1
to	1
her.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
frank,	1
had	1
now	1
become	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
for	1
various	1
reasons	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
avoided	1
her.	1
Julie,	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
corresponded	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
five	1
years,	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
alien	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
they	1
met.	1
Just	1
then	1
Julie,	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
her	1
brothers	1
had	1
become	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
richest	1
heiresses	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
whirl	1
of	1
society	1
pleasures.	1
She	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
young	1
men	1
who,	1
she	1
fancied,	1
had	1
suddenly	1
learned	1
to	1
appreciate	1
her	1
worth.	1
Julie	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
stage	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
society	1
woman	1
when	1
she	1
feels	1
that	1
her	1
last	1
chance	1
of	1
marrying	1
has	1
come	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
fate	1
must	1
be	1
decided	1
now	1
or	1
never.	1
On	1
Thursdays	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
remembered	1
with	1
a	1
mournful	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
now	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
write	1
to,	1
since	1
Julie--whose	1
presence	1
gave	1
her	1
no	1
pleasure	1
was	1
here	1
and	1
they	1
met	1
every	1
week.	1
Like	1
the	1
old	1
emigre	1
who	1
declined	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
lady	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
his	1
evenings	1
for	1
years,	1
she	1
regretted	1
Julie's	1
presence	1
and	1
having	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
write	1
to.	1
In	1
Moscow	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
talk	1
to,	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
to	1
confide	1
her	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
much	1
sorrow	1
fell	1
to	1
her	1
lot	1
just	1
then.	1
The	1
time	1
for	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
return	1
and	1
marriage	1
was	1
approaching,	1
but	1
his	1
request	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
prepare	1
his	1
father	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
carried	1
out;	1
in	1
fact,	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
matters	1
were	1
quite	1
hopeless,	1
for	1
at	1
every	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
Countess	1
Rostova	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
(who	1
apart	1
from	1
that	1
was	1
usually	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper)	1
lost	1
control	1
of	1
himself.	1
Another	1
lately	1
added	1
sorrow	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
lessons	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
six	1
year-old	1
nephew.	1
To	1
her	1
consternation	1
she	1
detected	1
in	1
herself	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
some	1
symptoms	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
irritability.	1
However	1
often	1
she	1
told	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
not	1
get	1
irritable	1
when	1
teaching	1
her	1
nephew,	1
almost	1
every	1
time	1
that,	1
pointer	1
in	1
hand,	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
French	1
alphabet,	1
she	1
so	1
longed	1
to	1
pour	1
her	1
own	1
knowledge	1
quickly	1
and	1
easily	1
into	1
the	1
child--who	1
was	1
already	1
afraid	1
that	1
Auntie	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
get	1
angry--that	1
at	1
his	1
slightest	1
inattention	1
she	1
trembled,	1
became	1
flustered	1
and	1
heated,	1
raised	1
her	1
voice,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
pulled	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
corner.	1
Having	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
begin	1
to	1
cry	1
over	1
her	1
cruel,	1
evil	1
nature,	1
and	1
little	1
Nicholas,	1
following	1
her	1
example,	1
would	1
sob,	1
and	1
without	1
permission	1
would	1
leave	1
his	1
corner,	1
come	1
to	1
her,	1
pull	1
her	1
wet	1
hands	1
from	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
comfort	1
her.	1
But	1
what	1
distressed	1
the	1
princess	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
her	1
father's	1
irritability,	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
directed	1
against	1
her	1
and	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
amounted	1
to	1
cruelty.	1
Had	1
he	1
forced	1
her	1
to	1
prostrate	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
all	1
night,	1
had	1
he	1
beaten	1
her	1
or	1
made	1
her	1
fetch	1
wood	1
or	1
water,	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
entered	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
think	1
her	1
position	1
hard;	1
but	1
this	1
loving	1
despot--the	1
more	1
cruel	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
tormented	1
himself	1
and	1
her--knew	1
how	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
hurt	1
and	1
humiliate	1
her	1
deliberately,	1
but	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
everything.	1
Of	1
late	1
he	1
had	1
exhibited	1
a	1
new	1
trait	1
that	1
tormented	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else;	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
ever-increasing	1
intimacy	1
with	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
The	1
idea	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
receiving	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
son's	1
intentions	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
jest--that	1
if	1
Andrew	1
got	1
married	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
marry	1
Bourienne--had	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
him,	1
and	1
latterly	1
he	1
had	1
persistently,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
merely	1
to	1
offend	1
her,	1
shown	1
special	1
endearments	1
to	1
the	1
companion	1
and	1
expressed	1
his	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
by	1
demonstrations	1
of	1
love	1
of	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
One	1
day	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
presence	1
(she	1
thought	1
her	1
father	1
did	1
it	1
purposely	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
there)	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
kissed	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
hand	1
and,	1
drawing	1
her	1
to	1
him,	1
embraced	1
her	1
affectionately.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
flushed	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
came	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
room	1
smiling	1
and	1
making	1
cheerful	1
remarks	1
in	1
her	1
agreeable	1
voice.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
hastily	1
wiped	1
away	1
her	1
tears,	1
went	1
resolutely	1
up	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
and	1
evidently	1
unconscious	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
began	1
shouting	1
in	1
angry	1
haste	1
at	1
the	1
Frenchwoman,	1
her	1
voice	1
breaking:	1
"It's	1
horrible,	1
vile,	1
inhuman,	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
weakness..."	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
finish.	1
"Leave	1
my	1
room,"	1
she	1
exclaimed,	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
prince	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
his	1
daughter,	1
but	1
she	1
noticed	1
that	1
at	1
dinner	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
should	1
be	1
served	1
first.	1
After	1
dinner,	1
when	1
the	1
footman	1
handed	1
coffee	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
began	1
with	1
the	1
princess,	1
the	1
prince	1
suddenly	1
grew	1
furious,	1
threw	1
his	1
stick	1
at	1
Philip,	1
and	1
instantly	1
gave	1
instructions	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
conscripted	1
for	1
the	1
army.	1
	1
"He	1
doesn't	1
obey...	1
I	1
said	1
it	1
twice...	1
and	1
he	1
doesn't	1
obey!	1
She	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
in	1
this	1
house;	1
she's	1
my	1
best	1
friend,"	1
cried	1
the	1
prince.	1
"And	1
if	1
you	1
allow	1
yourself,"	1
he	1
screamed	1
in	1
a	1
fury,	1
addressing	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
"to	1
forget	1
yourself	1
again	1
before	1
her	1
as	1
you	1
dared	1
to	1
do	1
yesterday,	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
who	1
is	1
master	1
in	1
this	1
house.	1
Go!	1
Don't	1
let	1
me	1
set	1
eyes	1
on	1
you;	1
beg	1
her	1
pardon!"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
asked	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
pardon,	1
and	1
also	1
her	1
father's	1
pardon	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
for	1
Philip	1
the	1
footman,	1
who	1
had	1
begged	1
for	1
her	1
intervention.	1
	1
At	1
such	1
moments	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
pride	1
of	1
sacrifice	1
gathered	1
in	1
her	1
soul.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
that	1
father	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
judged	1
would	1
look	1
for	1
his	1
spectacles	1
in	1
her	1
presence,	1
fumbling	1
near	1
them	1
and	1
not	1
seeing	1
them,	1
or	1
would	1
forget	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
occurred,	1
or	1
take	1
a	1
false	1
step	1
with	1
his	1
failing	1
legs	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
anyone	1
had	1
noticed	1
his	1
feebleness,	1
or,	1
worst	1
of	1
all,	1
at	1
dinner	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
visitors	1
to	1
excite	1
him	1
would	1
suddenly	1
fall	1
asleep,	1
letting	1
his	1
napkin	1
drop	1
and	1
his	1
shaking	1
head	1
sink	1
over	1
his	1
plate.	1
"He	1
is	1
old	1
and	1
feeble,	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
to	1
condemn	1
him!"	1
she	1
thought	1
at	1
such	1
moments,	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
revulsion	1
against	1
herself.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
In	1
1811	1
there	1
was	1
living	1
in	1
Moscow	1
a	1
French	1
doctor--Metivier--who	1
had	1
rapidly	1
become	1
the	1
fashion.	1
He	1
was	1
enormously	1
tall,	1
handsome,	1
amiable	1
as	1
Frenchmen	1
are,	1
and	1
was,	1
as	1
all	1
Moscow	1
said,	1
an	1
extraordinarily	1
clever	1
doctor.	1
He	1
was	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
houses	1
not	1
merely	1
as	1
a	1
doctor,	1
but	1
as	1
an	1
equal.	1
	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
always	1
ridiculed	1
medicine,	1
but	1
latterly	1
on	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
advice	1
had	1
allowed	1
this	1
doctor	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
grown	1
accustomed	1
to	1
him.	1
Metivier	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
prince	1
about	1
twice	1
a	1
week.	1
	1
On	1
December	1
6--St.	1
Nicholas'	1
Day	1
and	1
the	1
prince's	1
name	1
day--all	1
Moscow	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
prince's	1
front	1
door	1
but	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
admit	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
to	1
invite	1
to	1
dinner	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
number,	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
gave	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Metivier,	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
with	1
his	1
felicitations,	1
considered	1
it	1
proper	1
in	1
his	1
quality	1
of	1
doctor	1
de	1
forcer	1
la	1
consigne,	1
*	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
prince.	1
It	1
happened	1
that	1
on	1
that	1
morning	1
of	1
his	1
name	1
day	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
worst	1
moods.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
finding	1
fault	1
with	1
everyone	1
and	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
understood	1
himself.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
well	1
knew	1
this	1
mood	1
of	1
quiet	1
absorbed	1
querulousness,	1
which	1
generally	1
culminated	1
in	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
rage,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
about	1
all	1
that	1
morning	1
as	1
though	1
facing	1
a	1
cocked	1
and	1
loaded	1
gun	1
and	1
awaited	1
the	1
inevitable	1
explosion.	1
Until	1
the	1
doctor's	1
arrival	1
the	1
morning	1
had	1
passed	1
off	1
safely.	1
After	1
admitting	1
the	1
doctor,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
near	1
the	1
door	1
through	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
all	1
that	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
study.	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
force	1
the	1
guard.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
she	1
heard	1
only	1
Metivier's	1
voice,	1
then	1
her	1
father's,	1
then	1
both	1
voices	1
began	1
speaking	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
flung	1
open,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
appeared	1
the	1
handsome	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
terrified	1
Metivier	1
with	1
his	1
shock	1
of	1
black	1
hair,	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
fez,	1
his	1
face	1
distorted	1
with	1
fury	1
and	1
the	1
pupils	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
rolled	1
downwards.	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
understand?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince,	1
"but	1
I	1
do!	1
French	1
spy,	1
slave	1
of	1
Buonaparte,	1
spy,	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
house!	1
Be	1
off,	1
I	1
tell	1
you..."	1
	1
Metivier,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
shouting	1
had	1
run	1
in	1
from	1
an	1
adjoining	1
room.	1
	1
"The	1
prince	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
well:	1
bile	1
and	1
rush	1
of	1
blood	1
to	1
the	1
head.	1
Keep	1
calm,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
again	1
tomorrow,"	1
said	1
Metivier;	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
he	1
hastened	1
away.	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
study	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
slippered	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
cry:	1
"Spies,	1
traitors,	1
traitors	1
everywhere!	1
Not	1
a	1
moment's	1
peace	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
house!"	1
	1
After	1
Metivier's	1
departure	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
called	1
his	1
daughter	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
fell	1
on	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
that	1
a	1
spy	1
had	1
been	1
admitted.	1
Had	1
he	1
not	1
told	1
her,	1
yes,	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
list,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
admit	1
anyone	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
on	1
that	1
list?	1
Then	1
why	1
was	1
that	1
scoundrel	1
admitted?	1
She	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
all.	1
With	1
her,	1
he	1
said,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
moment's	1
peace	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
die	1
quietly.	1
	1
"No,	1
ma'am!	1
We	1
must	1
part,	1
we	1
must	1
part!	1
Understand	1
that,	1
understand	1
it!	1
I	1
cannot	1
endure	1
any	1
more,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
Then,	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
she	1
might	1
find	1
some	1
means	1
of	1
consolation,	1
he	1
returned	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
calm	1
added:	1
"And	1
don't	1
imagine	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
this	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
anger.	1
I	1
am	1
calm.	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
over,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
carried	1
out--we	1
must	1
part;	1
so	1
find	1
some	1
place	1
for	1
yourself...."	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
himself	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
virulence	1
of	1
which	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
loves	1
is	1
capable,	1
evidently	1
suffering	1
himself,	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
fists	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
screamed:	1
	1
"If	1
only	1
some	1
fool	1
would	1
marry	1
her!"	1
Then	1
he	1
slammed	1
the	1
door,	1
sent	1
for	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
and	1
subsided	1
into	1
his	1
study.	1
	1
At	1
two	1
o'clock	1
the	1
six	1
chosen	1
guests	1
assembled	1
for	1
dinner.	1
	1
These	1
guests--the	1
famous	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
Prince	1
Lopukhin	1
with	1
his	1
nephew,	1
General	1
Chatrov	1
an	1
old	1
war	1
comrade	1
of	1
the	1
prince's,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
generation	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy--awaited	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
Boris,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow	1
on	1
leave	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before,	1
had	1
been	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
to	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski,	1
and	1
had	1
contrived	1
to	1
ingratiate	1
himself	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
in	1
his	1
case	1
made	1
an	1
exception	1
to	1
the	1
rule	1
of	1
not	1
receiving	1
bachelors	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
The	1
prince's	1
house	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
known	1
as	1
fashionable	1
society,	1
but	1
his	1
little	1
circle--though	1
not	1
much	1
talked	1
about	1
in	1
town--	1
was	1
one	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
flattering	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
in	1
than	1
any	1
other.	1
Boris	1
had	1
realized	1
this	1
the	1
week	1
before	1
when	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
invited	1
Rostopchin	1
to	1
dinner	1
on	1
St.	1
Nicholas'	1
Day,	1
and	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
come:	1
	1
"On	1
that	1
day	1
I	1
always	1
go	1
to	1
pay	1
my	1
devotions	1
to	1
the	1
relics	1
of	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
yes!"	1
replied	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
"How	1
is	1
he?..."	1
	1
The	1
small	1
group	1
that	1
assembled	1
before	1
dinner	1
in	1
the	1
lofty	1
old-fashioned	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
its	1
old	1
furniture	1
resembled	1
the	1
solemn	1
gathering	1
of	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
justice.	1
All	1
were	1
silent	1
or	1
talked	1
in	1
low	1
tones.	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
came	1
in	1
serious	1
and	1
taciturn.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
seemed	1
even	1
quieter	1
and	1
more	1
diffident	1
than	1
usual.	1
The	1
guests	1
were	1
reluctant	1
to	1
address	1
her,	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
mood	1
for	1
their	1
conversation.	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
alone	1
kept	1
the	1
conversation	1
going,	1
now	1
relating	1
the	1
latest	1
town	1
news,	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
latest	1
political	1
gossip.	1
	1
Lopukhin	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
general	1
occasionally	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversation.	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
listened	1
as	1
a	1
presiding	1
judge	1
receives	1
a	1
report,	1
only	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
silently	1
or	1
by	1
a	1
brief	1
word,	1
showing	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
heed	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
reported	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
tone	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
indicated	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
approved	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
political	1
world.	1
Incidents	1
were	1
related	1
evidently	1
confirming	1
the	1
opinion	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
going	1
from	1
bad	1
to	1
worse,	1
but	1
whether	1
telling	1
a	1
story	1
or	1
giving	1
an	1
opinion	1
the	1
speaker	1
always	1
stopped,	1
or	1
was	1
stopped,	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
beyond	1
which	1
his	1
criticism	1
might	1
touch	1
the	1
sovereign	1
himself.	1
	1
At	1
dinner	1
the	1
talk	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
latest	1
political	1
news:	1
Napoleon's	1
seizure	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Oldenburg's	1
territory,	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
Note,	1
hostile	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
European	1
courts.	1
	1
"Bonaparte	1
treats	1
Europe	1
as	1
a	1
pirate	1
does	1
a	1
captured	1
vessel,"	1
said	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
repeating	1
a	1
phrase	1
he	1
had	1
uttered	1
several	1
times	1
before.	1
"One	1
only	1
wonders	1
at	1
the	1
long-suffering	1
or	1
blindness	1
of	1
the	1
crowned	1
heads.	1
Now	1
the	1
Pope's	1
turn	1
has	1
come	1
and	1
Bonaparte	1
doesn't	1
scruple	1
to	1
depose	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Catholic	1
Church--yet	1
all	1
keep	1
silent!	1
Our	1
sovereign	1
alone	1
has	1
protested	1
against	1
the	1
seizure	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Oldenburg's	1
territory,	1
and	1
even..."	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
paused,	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
limit	1
beyond	1
which	1
censure	1
was	1
impossible.	1
	1
"Other	1
territories	1
have	1
been	1
offered	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
the	1
Duchy	1
of	1
Oldenburg,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski.	1
"He	1
shifts	1
the	1
Dukes	1
about	1
as	1
I	1
might	1
move	1
my	1
serfs	1
from	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
to	1
Bogucharovo	1
or	1
my	1
Ryazan	1
estates."	1
	1
"The	1
Duke	1
of	1
Oldenburg	1
bears	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
with	1
admirable	1
strength	1
of	1
character	1
and	1
resignation,"	1
remarked	1
Boris,	1
joining	1
in	1
respectfully.	1
	1
He	1
said	1
this	1
because	1
on	1
his	1
journey	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
being	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
Duke.	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
in	1
reply,	1
but	1
changed	1
his	1
mind,	1
evidently	1
considering	1
him	1
too	1
young.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
read	1
our	1
protests	1
about	1
the	1
Oldenburg	1
affair	1
and	1
was	1
surprised	1
how	1
badly	1
the	1
Note	1
was	1
worded,"	1
remarked	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
in	1
the	1
casual	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
dealing	1
with	1
a	1
subject	1
quite	1
familiar	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
Rostopchin	1
with	1
naive	1
astonishment,	1
not	1
understanding	1
why	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
bad	1
composition	1
of	1
the	1
Note.	1
	1
"Does	1
it	1
matter,	1
Count,	1
how	1
the	1
Note	1
is	1
worded,"	1
he	1
asked,	1
"so	1
long	1
as	1
its	1
substance	1
is	1
forcible?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
with	1
our	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
troops	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
easy	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
style,"	1
returned	1
Count	1
Rostopchin.	1
	1
Pierre	1
now	1
understood	1
the	1
count's	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
the	1
wording	1
of	1
the	1
Note.	1
	1
"One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
quill	1
drivers	1
enough	1
had	1
sprung	1
up,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
"There	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
writing--not	1
notes	1
only	1
but	1
even	1
new	1
laws.	1
My	1
Andrew	1
there	1
has	1
written	1
a	1
whole	1
volume	1
of	1
laws	1
for	1
Russia.	1
Nowadays	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
writing!"	1
and	1
he	1
laughed	1
unnaturally.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
momentary	1
pause	1
in	1
the	1
conversation;	1
the	1
old	1
general	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
to	1
draw	1
attention.	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
hear	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
event	1
at	1
the	1
review	1
in	1
Petersburg?	1
The	1
figure	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
new	1
French	1
ambassador."	1
	1
"Eh?	1
Yes,	1
I	1
heard	1
something:	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
awkward	1
in	1
His	1
Majesty's	1
presence."	1
	1
"His	1
Majesty	1
drew	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
Grenadier	1
division	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
march	1
past,"	1
continued	1
the	1
general,	1
"and	1
it	1
seems	1
the	1
ambassador	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
and	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
reply	1
that:	1
'We	1
in	1
France	1
pay	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
such	1
trifles!'	1
The	1
Emperor	1
did	1
not	1
condescend	1
to	1
reply.	1
At	1
the	1
next	1
review,	1
they	1
say,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
deign	1
to	1
address	1
him."	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
On	1
this	1
fact	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
personally,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
pass	1
any	1
judgment.	1
	1
"Impudent	1
fellows!"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"You	1
know	1
Metivier?	1
I	1
turned	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
house	1
this	1
morning.	1
He	1
was	1
here;	1
they	1
admitted	1
him	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
request	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
let	1
no	1
one	1
in,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
glancing	1
angrily	1
at	1
his	1
daughter.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
narrated	1
his	1
whole	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
reasons	1
that	1
convinced	1
him	1
that	1
Metivier	1
was	1
a	1
spy.	1
Though	1
these	1
reasons	1
were	1
very	1
insufficient	1
and	1
obscure,	1
no	1
one	1
made	1
any	1
rejoinder.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
roast,	1
champagne	1
was	1
served.	1
The	1
guests	1
rose	1
to	1
congratulate	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
too,	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
He	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
cold,	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
offered	1
her	1
his	1
wrinkled,	1
clean-	1
shaven	1
cheek	1
to	1
kiss.	1
The	1
whole	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
forgotten	1
the	1
morning's	1
talk,	1
that	1
his	1
decision	1
remained	1
in	1
force,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
visitors	1
hindered	1
his	1
speaking	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
now.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
coffee	1
was	1
served,	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
sat	1
together.	1
	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
grew	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
expressed	1
his	1
views	1
on	1
the	1
impending	1
war.	1
	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
our	1
wars	1
with	1
Bonaparte	1
would	1
be	1
disastrous	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
we	1
sought	1
alliances	1
with	1
the	1
Germans	1
and	1
thrust	1
ourselves	1
into	1
European	1
affairs,	1
into	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
by	1
the	1
Peace	1
of	1
Tilsit.	1
"We	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
fight	1
either	1
for	1
or	1
against	1
Austria.	1
Our	1
political	1
interests	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
East,	1
and	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
Bonaparte	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
armed	1
frontier	1
and	1
a	1
firm	1
policy,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
dare	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
Russian	1
frontier,	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
1807!"	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
we	1
fight	1
the	1
French,	1
Prince?"	1
said	1
Count	1
Rostopchin.	1
"Can	1
we	1
arm	1
ourselves	1
against	1
our	1
teachers	1
and	1
divinities?	1
Look	1
at	1
our	1
youths,	1
look	1
at	1
our	1
ladies!	1
The	1
French	1
are	1
our	1
Gods:	1
Paris	1
is	1
our	1
Kingdom	1
of	1
Heaven."	1
	1
He	1
began	1
speaking	1
louder,	1
evidently	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
by	1
everyone.	1
	1
"French	1
dresses,	1
French	1
ideas,	1
French	1
feelings!	1
There	1
now,	1
you	1
turned	1
Metivier	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
scruff	1
of	1
his	1
neck	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
a	1
scoundrel,	1
but	1
our	1
ladies	1
crawl	1
after	1
him	1
on	1
their	1
knees.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
party	1
last	1
night,	1
and	1
there	1
out	1
of	1
five	1
ladies	1
three	1
were	1
Roman	1
Catholics	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
Pope's	1
indulgence	1
for	1
doing	1
woolwork	1
on	1
Sundays.	1
And	1
they	1
themselves	1
sit	1
there	1
nearly	1
naked,	1
like	1
the	1
signboards	1
at	1
our	1
Public	1
Baths	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
so.	1
Ah,	1
when	1
one	1
looks	1
at	1
our	1
young	1
people,	1
Prince,	1
one	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
take	1
Peter	1
the	1
Great's	1
old	1
cudgel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
museum	1
and	1
belabor	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
way	1
till	1
all	1
the	1
nonsense	1
jumps	1
out	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
looked	1
at	1
Rostopchin	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
wagged	1
his	1
head	1
approvingly.	1
	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
keep	1
well!"	1
said	1
Rostopchin,	1
getting	1
up	1
with	1
characteristic	1
briskness	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow....	1
His	1
words	1
are	1
music,	1
I	1
never	1
tire	1
of	1
hearing	1
him!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
keeping	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
offering	1
his	1
cheek	1
to	1
be	1
kissed.	1
	1
Following	1
Rostopchin's	1
example	1
the	1
others	1
also	1
rose.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
men's	1
talk	1
and	1
faultfinding,	1
understood	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
heard;	1
she	1
only	1
wondered	1
whether	1
the	1
guests	1
had	1
all	1
observed	1
her	1
father's	1
hostile	1
attitude	1
toward	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
notice	1
the	1
special	1
attentions	1
and	1
amiabilities	1
shown	1
her	1
during	1
dinner	1
by	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy,	1
who	1
was	1
visiting	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
already.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
turned	1
with	1
absent-minded	1
questioning	1
look	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
hat	1
in	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
guests	1
to	1
approach	1
her	1
after	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
longer?"	1
he	1
said,	1
letting	1
his	1
stout	1
body	1
sink	1
into	1
an	1
armchair	1
beside	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,"	1
she	1
answered.	1
"You	1
noticed	1
nothing?"	1
her	1
look	1
asked.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
agreeable	1
after-dinner	1
mood.	1
He	1
looked	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
smiled	1
quietly.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
known	1
that	1
young	1
man	1
long,	1
Princess?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Who?"	1
	1
"Drubetskoy."	1
	1
"No,	1
not	1
long..."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
like	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
agreeable	1
young	1
man....	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
ask	1
me	1
that?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
still	1
thinking	1
of	1
that	1
morning's	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
father.	1
	1
"Because	1
I	1
have	1
noticed	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
comes	1
on	1
leave	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
Moscow	1
it	1
is	1
usually	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
marrying	1
an	1
heiress."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
observed	1
that?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
returned	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"and	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
now	1
manages	1
matters	1
so	1
that	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
wealthy	1
heiress	1
there	1
he	1
is	1
too.	1
I	1
can	1
read	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
book.	1
At	1
present	1
he	1
is	1
hesitating	1
whom	1
to	1
lay	1
siege	1
to--	1
you	1
or	1
Mademoiselle	1
Julie	1
Karagina.	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
attentive	1
to	1
her."	1
	1
"He	1
visits	1
them?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
very	1
often.	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
new	1
way	1
of	1
courting?"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
with	1
an	1
amused	1
smile,	1
evidently	1
in	1
that	1
cheerful	1
mood	1
of	1
good	1
humored	1
raillery	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
so	1
often	1
reproached	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
diary.	1
	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"To	1
please	1
Moscow	1
girls	1
nowadays	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
melancholy.	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
melancholy	1
with	1
Mademoiselle	1
Karagina,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Really?"	1
asked	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
looking	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
kindly	1
face	1
and	1
still	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
sorrow.	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
relief,"	1
thought	1
she,	1
"if	1
I	1
ventured	1
to	1
confide	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
feeling	1
to	1
someone.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
tell	1
everything	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
is	1
kind	1
and	1
generous.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
relief.	1
He	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
advice."	1
	1
"Would	1
you	1
marry	1
him?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God,	1
Count,	1
there	1
are	1
moments	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
marry	1
anybody!"	1
she	1
cried	1
suddenly	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
surprise	1
and	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
voice.	1
"Ah,	1
how	1
bitter	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
love	1
someone	1
near	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
feel	1
that..."	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice,	1
"that	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
grieve	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
cannot	1
alter	1
this.	1
Then	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
left--to	1
go	1
away,	1
but	1
where	1
could	1
I	1
go?"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
wrong?	1
What	1
is	1
it,	1
Princess?"	1
	1
But	1
without	1
finishing	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
today.	1
Don't	1
take	1
any	1
notice--	1
forget	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said!"	1
	1
Pierre's	1
gaiety	1
vanished	1
completely.	1
He	1
anxiously	1
questioned	1
the	1
princess,	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
out	1
fully	1
and	1
confide	1
her	1
grief	1
to	1
him;	1
but	1
she	1
only	1
repeated	1
that	1
she	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
forget	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
trouble	1
except	1
the	1
one	1
he	1
knew	1
of--that	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
marriage	1
threatened	1
to	1
cause	1
a	1
rupture	1
between	1
father	1
and	1
son.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
any	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs?"	1
she	1
asked,	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject.	1
"I	1
was	1
told	1
they	1
are	1
coming	1
soon.	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
expecting	1
Andrew	1
any	1
day.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
them	1
to	1
meet	1
here."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
does	1
he	1
now	1
regard	1
the	1
matter?"	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
the	1
year	1
will	1
be	1
up.	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
impossible.	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
spare	1
my	1
brother	1
the	1
first	1
moments.	1
I	1
wish	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
sooner.	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
friends	1
with	1
her.	1
You	1
have	1
known	1
them	1
a	1
long	1
time,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Tell	1
me	1
honestly	1
the	1
whole	1
truth:	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
is	1
she,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
her?--The	1
real	1
truth,	1
because	1
you	1
know	1
Andrew	1
is	1
risking	1
so	1
much	1
doing	1
this	1
against	1
his	1
father's	1
will	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know..."	1
	1
An	1
undefined	1
instinct	1
told	1
Pierre	1
that	1
these	1
explanations,	1
and	1
repeated	1
requests	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
the	1
whole	1
truth,	1
expressed	1
ill-will	1
on	1
the	1
princess'	1
part	1
toward	1
her	1
future	1
sister-in-law	1
and	1
a	1
wish	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
disapprove	1
of	1
Andrew's	1
choice;	1
but	1
in	1
reply	1
he	1
said	1
what	1
he	1
felt	1
rather	1
than	1
what	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
answer	1
your	1
question,"	1
he	1
said,	1
blushing	1
without	1
knowing	1
why.	1
"I	1
really	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
she	1
is;	1
I	1
can't	1
analyze	1
her	1
at	1
all.	1
She	1
is	1
enchanting,	1
but	1
what	1
makes	1
her	1
so	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
one	1
can	1
say	1
about	1
her."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sighed,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
said:	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
what	1
I	1
expected	1
and	1
feared."	1
	1
"Is	1
she	1
clever?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
Pierre	1
considered.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
not,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
yet--yes.	1
She	1
does	1
not	1
deign	1
to	1
be	1
clever....	1
Oh	1
no,	1
she	1
is	1
simply	1
enchanting,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
all."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
again	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
disapprovingly.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
I	1
so	1
long	1
to	1
like	1
her!	1
Tell	1
her	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
see	1
her	1
before	1
I	1
do."	1
	1
"I	1
hear	1
they	1
are	1
expected	1
very	1
soon,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
told	1
Pierre	1
of	1
her	1
plan	1
to	1
become	1
intimate	1
with	1
her	1
future	1
sister-in-law	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
arrived	1
and	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
accustom	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
her.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
Boris	1
had	1
not	1
succeeded	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
wealthy	1
match	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
object	1
in	1
view	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
There	1
he	1
wavered	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
richest	1
heiresses,	1
Julie	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Though	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
despite	1
her	1
plainness	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
more	1
attractive	1
than	1
Julie,	1
he,	1
without	1
knowing	1
why,	1
felt	1
awkward	1
about	1
paying	1
court	1
to	1
her.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
last	1
met	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
name	1
day,	1
she	1
had	1
answered	1
at	1
random	1
all	1
his	1
attempts	1
to	1
talk	1
sentimentally,	1
evidently	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
Julie	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
accepted	1
his	1
attentions	1
readily,	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
peculiar	1
to	1
herself.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
twenty-seven.	1
After	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
her	1
brothers	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
very	1
wealthy.	1
She	1
was	1
by	1
now	1
decidedly	1
plain,	1
but	1
thought	1
herself	1
not	1
merely	1
as	1
good-looking	1
as	1
before	1
but	1
even	1
far	1
more	1
attractive.	1
She	1
was	1
confirmed	1
in	1
this	1
delusion	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
very	1
wealthy	1
heiress	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
older	1
she	1
grew	1
the	1
less	1
dangerous	1
she	1
became	1
to	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
freely	1
they	1
could	1
associate	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
avail	1
themselves	1
of	1
her	1
suppers,	1
soirees,	1
and	1
the	1
animated	1
company	1
that	1
assembled	1
at	1
her	1
house,	1
without	1
incurring	1
any	1
obligation.	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
afraid	1
ten	1
years	1
before	1
of	1
going	1
every	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
seventeen	1
there,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
compromising	1
her	1
and	1
committing	1
himself,	1
would	1
now	1
go	1
boldly	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
treat	1
her	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
marriageable	1
girl	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
sexless	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
That	1
winter	1
the	1
Karagins'	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
agreeable	1
and	1
hospitable	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
formal	1
evening	1
and	1
dinner	1
parties,	1
a	1
large	1
company,	1
chiefly	1
of	1
men,	1
gathered	1
there	1
every	1
day,	1
supping	1
at	1
midnight	1
and	1
staying	1
till	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
Julie	1
never	1
missed	1
a	1
ball,	1
a	1
promenade,	1
or	1
a	1
play.	1
Her	1
dresses	1
were	1
always	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
disillusioned	1
about	1
everything	1
and	1
told	1
everyone	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
either	1
in	1
friendship	1
or	1
in	1
love,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
expected	1
peace	1
only	1
"yonder."	1
She	1
adopted	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
suffered	1
a	1
great	1
disappointment,	1
like	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
has	1
either	1
lost	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loved	1
or	1
been	1
cruelly	1
deceived	1
by	1
him.	1
Though	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
regarded	1
in	1
that	1
light,	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
herself	1
come	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
much	1
in	1
life.	1
This	1
melancholy,	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
her	1
amusing	1
herself,	1
did	1
not	1
hinder	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
house	1
from	1
passing	1
the	1
time	1
pleasantly.	1
Every	1
visitor	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
paid	1
his	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
melancholy	1
mood	1
of	1
the	1
hostess,	1
and	1
then	1
amused	1
himself	1
with	1
society	1
gossip,	1
dancing,	1
intellectual	1
games,	1
and	1
bouts	1
rimes,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
vogue	1
at	1
the	1
Karagins'.	1
Only	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
these	1
young	1
men,	1
among	1
them	1
Boris,	1
entered	1
more	1
deeply	1
into	1
Julie's	1
melancholy,	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
she	1
had	1
prolonged	1
conversations	1
in	1
private	1
on	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
all	1
worldly	1
things,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
she	1
showed	1
her	1
albums	1
filled	1
with	1
mournful	1
sketches,	1
maxims,	1
and	1
verses.	1
	1
To	1
Boris,	1
Julie	1
was	1
particularly	1
gracious:	1
she	1
regretted	1
his	1
early	1
disillusionment	1
with	1
life,	1
offered	1
him	1
such	1
consolation	1
of	1
friendship	1
as	1
she	1
who	1
had	1
herself	1
suffered	1
so	1
much	1
could	1
render,	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
her	1
album.	1
Boris	1
sketched	1
two	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
album	1
and	1
wrote:	1
"Rustic	1
trees,	1
your	1
dark	1
branches	1
shed	1
gloom	1
and	1
melancholy	1
upon	1
me."	1
	1
On	1
another	1
page	1
he	1
drew	1
a	1
tomb,	1
and	1
wrote:	1
	1
	1
La	1
mort	1
est	1
secourable	1
et	1
la	1
mort	1
est	1
tranquille.	1
Ah!	1
contre	1
les	1
douleurs	1
il	1
n'y	1
a	1
pas	1
d'autre	1
asile.	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
Death	1
gives	1
relief	1
and	1
death	1
is	1
peaceful.	1
	1
Ah!	1
from	1
suffering	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
refuge.	1
	1
Julie	1
said	1
this	1
was	1
charming	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
something	1
so	1
enchanting	1
in	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
melancholy,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Boris,	1
repeating	1
word	1
for	1
word	1
a	1
passage	1
she	1
had	1
copied	1
from	1
a	1
book.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
a	1
shade	1
between	1
sadness	1
and	1
despair,	1
showing	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
consolation."	1
	1
In	1
reply	1
Boris	1
wrote	1
these	1
lines:	1
	1
	1
Aliment	1
de	1
poison	1
d'une	1
ame	1

sensible,	1
Toi,	1

	1
*Poisonous	1

a	1
too	1
sensitive	1
soul,	1
Thou,	1
without	1
whom	1
happiness	1

me	1
be	1
impossible,	1
Tender	1

ah,	1

me,	1
Come	1
to	1

the	1
torments	1
of	1
my	1
gloomy	1
retreat,	1
And	1
mingle	1
a	1
secret	1
sweetness	1
With	1
these	1
tears	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
to	1
be	1
flowing.	1
	1
For	1
Boris,	1
Julie	1
played	1
most	1
doleful	1
nocturnes	1
on	1
her	1
harp.	1
Boris	1
read	1
'Poor	1
Liza'	1
aloud	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
interrupted	1
the	1
reading	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
emotions	1
that	1
choked	1
him.	1
Meeting	1
at	1
large	1
gatherings	1
Julie	1
and	1
Boris	1
looked	1
on	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
souls	1
who	1
understood	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
indifferent	1
people.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
who	1
often	1
visited	1
the	1
Karagins,	1
while	1
playing	1
cards	1
with	1
the	1
mother	1
made	1
careful	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
Julie's	1
dowry	1
(she	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
estates	1
in	1
Penza	1
and	1
the	1
Nizhegorod	1
forests).	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
regarded	1
the	1
refined	1
sadness	1
that	1
united	1
her	1
son	1
to	1
the	1
wealthy	1
Julie	1
with	1
emotion,	1
and	1
resignation	1
to	1
the	1
Divine	1
will.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
always	1
charming	1
and	1
melancholy,	1
my	1
dear	1
Julie,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
daughter.	1
"Boris	1
says	1
his	1
soul	1
finds	1
repose	1
at	1
your	1
house.	1
He	1
has	1
suffered	1
so	1
many	1
disappointments	1
and	1
is	1
so	1
sensitive,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
mother.	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
fond	1
I	1
have	1
grown	1
of	1
Julie	1
latterly,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
son.	1
"But	1
who	1
could	1
help	1
loving	1
her?	1
She	1
is	1
an	1
angelic	1
being!	1
Ah,	1
Boris,	1
Boris!"--she	1
paused.	1
"And	1
how	1
I	1
pity	1
her	1
mother,"	1
she	1
went	1
on;	1
"today	1
she	1
showed	1
me	1
her	1
accounts	1
and	1
letters	1
from	1
Penza	1
(they	1
have	1
enormous	1
estates	1
there),	1
and	1
she,	1
poor	1
thing,	1
has	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
help	1
her,	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
cheat	1
her	1
so!"	1
	1
Boris	1
smiled	1
almost	1
imperceptibly	1
while	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
mother.	1
He	1
laughed	1
blandly	1
at	1
her	1
naive	1
diplomacy	1
but	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
questioned	1
her	1
carefully	1
about	1
the	1
Penza	1
and	1
Nizhegorod	1
estates.	1
	1
Julie	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
expecting	1
a	1
proposal	1
from	1
her	1
melancholy	1
adorer	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
accept	1
it;	1
but	1
some	1
secret	1
feeling	1
of	1
repulsion	1
for	1
her,	1
for	1
her	1
passionate	1
desire	1
to	1
get	1
married,	1
for	1
her	1
artificiality,	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
horror	1
at	1
renouncing	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
real	1
love	1
still	1
restrained	1
Boris.	1
His	1
leave	1
was	1
expiring.	1
He	1
spent	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
whole	1
days	1
at	1
the	1
Karagins',	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
on	1
thinking	1
the	1
matter	1
over	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
propose	1
tomorrow.	1
But	1
in	1
Julie's	1
presence,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
red	1
face	1
and	1
chin	1
(nearly	1
always	1
powdered),	1
her	1
moist	1
eyes,	1
and	1
her	1
expression	1
of	1
continual	1
readiness	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
melancholy	1
to	1
an	1
unnatural	1
rapture	1
of	1
married	1
bliss,	1
Boris	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
the	1
decisive	1
words,	1
though	1
in	1
imagination	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
regarded	1
himself	1
as	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
those	1
Penza	1
and	1
Nizhegorod	1
estates	1
and	1
had	1
apportioned	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
income	1
from	1
them.	1
Julie	1
saw	1
Boris'	1
indecision,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
the	1
thought	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
repulsive	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
her	1
feminine	1
self-deception	1
immediately	1
supplied	1
her	1
with	1
consolation,	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
herself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
shy	1
from	1
love.	1
Her	1
melancholy,	1
however,	1
began	1
to	1
turn	1
to	1
irritability,	1
and	1
not	1
long	1
before	1
Boris'	1
departure	1
she	1
formed	1
a	1
definite	1
plan	1
of	1
action.	1
Just	1
as	1
Boris'	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
was	1
expiring,	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
made	1
his	1
appearance	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
in	1
the	1
Karagins'	1
drawing	1
room,	1
and	1
Julie,	1
suddenly	1
abandoning	1
her	1
melancholy,	1
became	1
cheerful	1
and	1
very	1
attentive	1
to	1
Kuragin.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
to	1
her	1
son,	1
"I	1
know	1
from	1
a	1
reliable	1
source	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
has	1
sent	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
Moscow	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
married	1
to	1
Julie.	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
Julie	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
her.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
being	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
and	1
of	1
having	1
thrown	1
away	1
that	1
whole	1
month	1
of	1
arduous	1
melancholy	1
service	1
to	1
Julie,	1
and	1
of	1
seeing	1
all	1
the	1
revenue	1
from	1
the	1
Penza	1
estates	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
mentally	1
apportioned	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
proper	1
use	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
another,	1
and	1
especially	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
that	1
idiot	1
Anatole,	1
pained	1
Boris.	1
He	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
Karagins'	1
with	1
the	1
firm	1
intention	1
of	1
proposing.	1
Julie	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
gay,	1
careless	1
manner,	1
spoke	1
casually	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
yesterday's	1
ball,	1
and	1
asked	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
leaving.	1
Though	1
Boris	1
had	1
come	1
intentionally	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
therefore	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
tender,	1
he	1
began	1
speaking	1
irritably	1
of	1
feminine	1
inconstancy,	1
of	1
how	1
easily	1
women	1
can	1
turn	1
from	1
sadness	1
to	1
joy,	1
and	1
how	1
their	1
moods	1
depend	1
solely	1
on	1
who	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
paying	1
court	1
to	1
them.	1
Julie	1
was	1
offended	1
and	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
needs	1
variety,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
would	1
weary	1
anyone.	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
should	1
advise	1
you..."	1
Boris	1
began,	1
wishing	1
to	1
sting	1
her;	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
galling	1
thought	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
without	1
having	1
accomplished	1
his	1
aim,	1
and	1
have	1
vainly	1
wasted	1
his	1
efforts--which	1
was	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
never	1
allowed	1
to	1
happen.	1
	1
He	1
checked	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
sentence,	1
lowered	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
her	1
unpleasantly	1
irritated	1
and	1
irresolute	1
face,	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
here	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
quarrel	1
with	1
you.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary..."	1
	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
on.	1
Her	1
irritability	1
had	1
suddenly	1
quite	1
vanished,	1
and	1
her	1
anxious,	1
imploring	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
greedy	1
expectation.	1
"I	1
can	1
always	1
arrange	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
often,"	1
thought	1
Boris.	1
"The	1
affair	1
has	1
been	1
begun	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
finished!"	1
He	1
blushed	1
hotly,	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
hers,	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
my	1
feelings	1
for	1
you!"	1
	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
say	1
more:	1
Julie's	1
face	1
shone	1
with	1
triumph	1
and	1
self-	1
satisfaction;	1
but	1
she	1
forced	1
Boris	1
to	1
say	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
said	1
on	1
such	1
occasions--that	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
loved	1
any	1
other	1
woman	1
more	1
than	1
her.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
Penza	1
estates	1
and	1
Nizhegorod	1
forests	1
she	1
could	1
demand	1
this,	1
and	1
she	1
received	1
what	1
she	1
demanded.	1
	1
The	1
affianced	1
couple,	1
no	1
longer	1
alluding	1
to	1
trees	1
that	1
shed	1
gloom	1
and	1
melancholy	1
upon	1
them,	1
planned	1
the	1
arrangements	1
of	1
a	1
splendid	1
house	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
paid	1
calls,	1
and	1
prepared	1
everything	1
for	1
a	1
brilliant	1
wedding.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
January	1
old	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
with	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Sonya.	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
still	1
unwell	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
travel	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
recovery.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
expected	1
in	1
Moscow	1
any	1
day,	1
the	1
trousseau	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
ordered	1
and	1
the	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
sold,	1
besides	1
which	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
presenting	1
his	1
future	1
daughter-in-law	1
to	1
old	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
missed.	1
The	1
Rostovs'	1
Moscow	1
house	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
heated	1
that	1
winter	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
them,	1
the	1
count	1
decided	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
Akhrosimova,	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
pressing	1
her	1
hospitality	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
Late	1
one	1
evening	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
four	1
sleighs	1
drove	1
into	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
courtyard	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
Konyusheny	1
street.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
lived	1
alone.	1
She	1
had	1
already	1
married	1
off	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
her	1
sons	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
service.	1
	1
She	1
held	1
herself	1
as	1
erect,	1
told	1
everyone	1
her	1
opinion	1
as	1
candidly,	1
loudly,	1
and	1
bluntly	1
as	1
ever,	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
bearing	1
seemed	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
others	1
for	1
any	1
weakness,	1
passion,	1
or	1
temptation--the	1
possibility	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
admit.	1
From	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
wearing	1
a	1
dressing	1
jacket,	1
she	1
attended	1
to	1
her	1
household	1
affairs,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
drove	1
out:	1
on	1
holy	1
days	1
to	1
church	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
service	1
to	1
jails	1
and	1
prisons	1
on	1
affairs	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
never	1
spoke	1
to	1
anyone.	1
On	1
ordinary	1
days,	1
after	1
dressing,	1
she	1
received	1
petitioners	1
of	1
various	1
classes,	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
always	1
some.	1
Then	1
she	1
had	1
dinner,	1
a	1
substantial	1
and	1
appetizing	1
meal	1
at	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
always	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
guests;	1
after	1
dinner	1
she	1
played	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
boston,	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
newspapers	1
or	1
a	1
new	1
book	1
read	1
to	1
her	1
while	1
she	1
knitted.	1
She	1
rarely	1
made	1
an	1
exception	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
pay	1
visits,	1
and	1
then	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
when	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
arrived	1
and	1
the	1
pulley	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
door	1
squeaked	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
as	1
it	1
let	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
their	1
servants.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
with	1
her	1
spectacles	1
hanging	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
nose	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
flung	1
back,	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
doorway	1
looking	1
with	1
a	1
stern,	1
grim	1
face	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
arrivals.	1
One	1
might	1
have	1
thought	1
she	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
travelers	1
and	1
would	1
immediately	1
turn	1
them	1
out,	1
had	1
she	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
been	1
giving	1
careful	1
instructions	1
to	1
the	1
servants	1
for	1
the	1
accommodation	1
of	1
the	1
visitors	1
and	1
their	1
belongings.	1
	1
"The	1
count's	1
things?	1
Bring	1
them	1
here,"	1
she	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
portmanteaus	1
and	1
not	1
greeting	1
anyone.	1
"The	1
young	1
ladies'?	1
There	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
Now	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
dawdling	1
for?"	1
she	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
maids.	1
"Get	1
the	1
samovar	1
ready!...	1
You've	1
grown	1
plumper	1
and	1
prettier,"	1
she	1
remarked,	1
drawing	1
Natasha	1
(whose	1
cheeks	1
were	1
glowing	1
from	1
the	1
cold)	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hood.	1
"Foo!	1
You	1
are	1
cold!	1
Now	1
take	1
off	1
your	1
things,	1
quick!"	1
she	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hand.	1
"You're	1
half	1
frozen,	1
I'm	1
sure!	1
Bring	1
some	1
rum	1
for	1
tea!...	1
Bonjour,	1
Sonya	1
dear!"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Sonya	1
and	1
indicating	1
by	1
this	1
French	1
greeting	1
her	1
slightly	1
contemptuous	1
though	1
affectionate	1
attitude	1
toward	1
her.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
tea,	1
having	1
taken	1
off	1
their	1
outdoor	1
things	1
and	1
tidied	1
themselves	1
up	1
after	1
their	1
journey,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
kissed	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
due	1
order.	1
	1
"I'm	1
heartily	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
and	1
are	1
staying	1
with	1
me.	1
It	1
was	1
high	1
time,"	1
she	1
said,	1
giving	1
Natasha	1
a	1
significant	1
look.	1
"The	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
here	1
and	1
his	1
son's	1
expected	1
any	1
day.	1
You'll	1
have	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
acquaintance.	1
But	1
we'll	1
speak	1
of	1
that	1
later	1
on,"	1
she	1
added,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Sonya	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
that	1
showed	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
presence.	1
"Now	1
listen,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
tomorrow?	1
Whom	1
will	1
you	1
send	1
for?	1
Shinshin?"	1
she	1
crooked	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
fingers.	1
"The	1
sniveling	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna?	1
That's	1
two.	1
She's	1
here	1
with	1
her	1
son.	1
The	1
son	1
is	1
getting	1
married!	1
Then	1
Bezukhov,	1
eh?	1
He	1
is	1
here	1
too,	1
with	1
his	1
wife.	1
He	1
ran	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
galloping	1
after	1
him.	1
He	1
dined	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
Wednesday.	1
As	1
for	1
them"--and	1
she	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
girls--"tomorrow	1
I'll	1
take	1
them	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
Iberian	1
shrine	1
of	1
the	1
Mother	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
then	1
we'll	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
Super-Rogue's.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you'll	1
have	1
everything	1
new.	1
Don't	1
judge	1
by	1
me:	1
sleeves	1
nowadays	1
are	1
this	1
size!	1
The	1
other	1
day	1
young	1
Princess	1
Irina	1
Vasilevna	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
me;	1
she	1
was	1
an	1
awful	1
sight--looked	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
two	1
barrels	1
on	1
her	1
arms.	1
You	1
know	1
not	1
a	1
day	1
passes	1
now	1
without	1
some	1
new	1
fashion....	1
And	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
yourself?"	1
she	1
asked	1
the	1
count	1
sternly.	1
	1
"One	1
thing	1
has	1
come	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
another:	1
her	1
rags	1
to	1
buy,	1
and	1
now	1
a	1
purchaser	1
has	1
turned	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
Moscow	1
estate	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
house.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
kind,	1
I'll	1
fix	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
estate	1
just	1
for	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
leave	1
my	1
lassies	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
"All	1
right.	1
All	1
right.	1
They'll	1
be	1
safe	1
with	1
me,	1
as	1
safe	1
as	1
in	1
Chancery!	1
I'll	1
take	1
them	1
where	1
they	1
must	1
go,	1
scold	1
them	1
a	1
bit,	1
and	1
pet	1
them	1
a	1
bit,"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
touching	1
her	1
goddaughter	1
and	1
favorite,	1
Natasha,	1
on	1
the	1
cheek	1
with	1
her	1
large	1
hand.	1
	1
Next	1
morning	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
took	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
to	1
the	1
Iberian	1
shrine	1
of	1
the	1
Mother	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
Madame	1
Suppert-Roguet,	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
afraid	1
of	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
that	1
she	1
always	1
let	1
her	1
have	1
costumes	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
merely	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
her.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
ordered	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
trousseau.	1
When	1
they	1
got	1
home	1
she	1
turned	1
everybody	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
except	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
then	1
called	1
her	1
pet	1
to	1
her	1
armchair.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
we'll	1
talk.	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
betrothed.	1
You've	1
hooked	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow!	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
and	1
I've	1
known	1
him	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
high."	1
She	1
held	1
her	1
hand	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
feet	1
from	1
the	1
ground.	1
Natasha	1
blushed	1
happily.	1
"I	1
like	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
family.	1
Now	1
listen!	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
old	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
much	1
dislikes	1
his	1
son's	1
marrying.	1
The	1
old	1
fellow's	1
crotchety!	1
Of	1
course	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
can	1
shift	1
without	1
him,	1
but	1
it's	1
not	1
nice	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
family	1
against	1
a	1
father's	1
will.	1
One	1
wants	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
peacefully	1
and	1
lovingly.	1
You're	1
a	1
clever	1
girl	1
and	1
you'll	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
manage.	1
Be	1
kind,	1
and	1
use	1
your	1
wits.	1
Then	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
well."	1
	1
Natasha	1
remained	1
silent,	1
from	1
shyness	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
supposed,	1
but	1
really	1
because	1
she	1
disliked	1
anyone	1
interfering	1
in	1
what	1
touched	1
her	1
love	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
apart	1
from	1
all	1
human	1
affairs	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
understand	1
it.	1
She	1
loved	1
and	1
knew	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
only,	1
and	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
days	1
and	1
take	1
her.	1
She	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
more.	1
	1
"You	1
see	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
and	1
am	1
also	1
fond	1
of	1
Mary,	1
your	1
future	1
sister-in-law.	1
'Husbands'	1
sisters	1
bring	1
up	1
blisters,'	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
wouldn't	1
hurt	1
a	1
fly.	1
She	1
has	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
you	1
two	1
together.	1
Tomorrow	1
you'll	1
go	1
with	1
your	1
father	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
Be	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
affectionate	1
to	1
her:	1
you're	1
younger	1
than	1
she.	1
When	1
he	1
comes,	1
he'll	1
find	1
you	1
already	1
know	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
father	1
and	1
are	1
liked	1
by	1
them.	1
Am	1
I	1
right	1
or	1
not?	1
Won't	1
that	1
be	1
best?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
will,"	1
Natasha	1
answered	1
reluctantly.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
by	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
advice,	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
took	1
Natasha	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski.	1
The	1
count	1
did	1
not	1
set	1
out	1
cheerfully	1
on	1
this	1
visit,	1
at	1
heart	1
he	1
felt	1
afraid.	1
He	1
well	1
remembered	1
the	1
last	1
interview	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
enrollment,	1
when	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
dinner	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
an	1
angry	1
reprimand	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
provided	1
his	1
full	1
quota	1
of	1
men.	1
Natasha,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
having	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
best	1
gown,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spirits.	1
"They	1
can't	1
help	1
liking	1
me,"	1
she	1
thought.	1
"Everybody	1
always	1
has	1
liked	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
willing	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
they	1
wish,	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
him--for	1
being	1
his	1
father--and	1
of	1
her--for	1
being	1
his	1
sister--	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
like	1
me..."	1
	1
They	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gloomy	1
old	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
vestibule.	1
	1
"Well,	1
the	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us!"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
half	1
in	1
jest,	1
half	1
in	1
earnest;	1
but	1
Natasha	1
noticed	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
flurried	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
anteroom	1
and	1
inquired	1
timidly	1
and	1
softly	1
whether	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
princess	1
were	1
at	1
home.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
announced	1
a	1
perturbation	1
was	1
noticeable	1
among	1
the	1
servants.	1
The	1
footman	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
announce	1
them	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
hall	1
and	1
they	1
whispered	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
Then	1
a	1
maidservant	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
said	1
something,	1
mentioning	1
the	1
princess.	1
At	1
last	1
an	1
old,	1
cross	1
looking	1
footman	1
came	1
and	1
announced	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
not	1
receiving,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
begged	1
them	1
to	1
walk	1
up.	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
visitors	1
was	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
She	1
greeted	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
daughter	1
with	1
special	1
politeness	1
and	1
showed	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
princess'	1
room.	1
The	1
princess,	1
looking	1
excited	1
and	1
nervous,	1
her	1
face	1
flushed	1
in	1
patches,	1
ran	1
in	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
visitors,	1
treading	1
heavily,	1
and	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
cordial	1
and	1
at	1
ease.	1
From	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
thought	1
her	1
too	1
fashionably	1
dressed,	1
frivolously	1
gay	1
and	1
vain.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
realize	1
that	1
before	1
having	1
seen	1
her	1
future	1
sister-in-law	1
she	1
was	1
prejudiced	1
against	1
her	1
by	1
involuntary	1
envy	1
of	1
her	1
beauty,	1
youth,	1
and	1
happiness,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
jealousy	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
love	1
for	1
her.	1
Apart	1
from	1
this	1
insuperable	1
antipathy	1
to	1
her,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
agitated	1
just	1
then	1
because	1
on	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
being	1
announced,	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
shouted	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
might	1
do	1
so	1
if	1
she	1
chose,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
admitted	1
to	1
him.	1
She	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
receive	1
them,	1
but	1
feared	1
lest	1
the	1
prince	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
indulge	1
in	1
some	1
freak,	1
as	1
he	1
seemed	1
much	1
upset	1
by	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
visit.	1
	1
"There,	1
my	1
dear	1
princess,	1
I've	1
brought	1
you	1
my	1
songstress,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
bowing	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
uneasily	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
might	1
appear.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
you	1
should	1
get	1
to	1
know	1
one	1
another...	1
very	1
sorry	1
the	1
prince	1
is	1
still	1
ailing,"	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
commonplace	1
remarks	1
he	1
rose.	1
"If	1
you'll	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
leave	1
my	1
Natasha	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
for	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour,	1
Princess,	1
I'll	1
drive	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
Anna	1
Semenovna,	1
it's	1
quite	1
near	1
in	1
the	1
Dogs'	1
Square,	1
and	1
then	1
I'll	1
come	1
back	1
for	1
her."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
devised	1
this	1
diplomatic	1
ruse	1
(as	1
he	1
afterwards	1
told	1
his	1
daughter)	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
future	1
sisters-in-law	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
freely,	1
but	1
another	1
motive	1
was	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
encountering	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
afraid.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
mention	1
this	1
to	1
his	1
daughter,	1
but	1
Natasha	1
noticed	1
her	1
father's	1
nervousness	1
and	1
anxiety	1
and	1
felt	1
mortified	1
by	1
it.	1
She	1
blushed	1
for	1
him,	1
grew	1
still	1
angrier	1
at	1
having	1
blushed,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
bold	1
and	1
defiant	1
expression	1
which	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
anybody.	1
The	1
princess	1
told	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
delighted,	1
and	1
only	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
stay	1
longer	1
at	1
Anna	1
Semenovna's,	1
and	1
he	1
departed.	1
	1
Despite	1
the	1
uneasy	1
glances	1
thrown	1
at	1
her	1
by	1
Princess	1
Mary--who	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
tête-à-tête	1
with	1
Natasha--Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
persistently	1
talked	1
about	1
Moscow	1
amusements	1
and	1
theaters.	1
Natasha	1
felt	1
offended	1
by	1
the	1
hesitation	1
she	1
had	1
noticed	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
by	1
her	1
father's	1
nervousness,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
unnatural	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
who--she	1
thought--was	1
making	1
a	1
favor	1
of	1
receiving	1
her,	1
and	1
so	1
everything	1
displeased	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
whom	1
she	1
thought	1
very	1
plain,	1
affected,	1
and	1
dry.	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
shrank	1
into	1
herself	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
assumed	1
an	1
offhand	1
air	1
which	1
alienated	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
still	1
more.	1
After	1
five	1
minutes	1
of	1
irksome,	1
constrained	1
conversation,	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
slippered	1
feet	1
rapidly	1
approaching.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
frightened.	1
	1
The	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
in	1
a	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
nightcap,	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
madam!"	1
he	1
began.	1
"Madam,	1
Countess...	1
Countess	1
Rostova,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mistaken...	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
excuse	1
me,	1
to	1
excuse	1
me...	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
madam.	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
had	1
honored	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
visit,	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
costume	1
only	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
daughter.	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
excuse	1
me...	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,	1
I	1
didn't	1
know-"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
stressing	1
the	1
word	1
"God"	1
so	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
so	1
unpleasantly	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
stood	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
look	1
either	1
at	1
her	1
father	1
or	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Nor	1
did	1
the	1
latter,	1
having	1
risen	1
and	1
curtsied,	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
alone	1
smiled	1
agreeably.	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
excuse	1
me,	1
excuse	1
me!	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
after	1
looking	1
Natasha	1
over	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
he	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
recover	1
herself	1
after	1
this	1
apparition	1
and	1
began	1
speaking	1
about	1
the	1
prince's	1
indisposition.	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
the	1
longer	1
they	1
did	1
so	1
without	1
saying	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
greater	1
grew	1
their	1
antipathy	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
count	1
returned,	1
Natasha	1
was	1
impolitely	1
pleased	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
get	1
away:	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
hated	1
the	1
stiff,	1
elderly	1
princess,	1
who	1
could	1
place	1
her	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
embarrassing	1
position	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
with	1
her	1
without	1
once	1
mentioning	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"I	1
couldn't	1
begin	1
talking	1
about	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
that	1
Frenchwoman,"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
The	1
same	1
thought	1
was	1
meanwhile	1
tormenting	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
She	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
because	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
because,	1
without	1
knowing	1
why,	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
marriage.	1
When	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
already	1
leaving	1
the	1
room,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
up	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh:	1
	1
"Wait,	1
I	1
must..."	1
	1
Natasha	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
ironically	1
without	1
knowing	1
why.	1
	1
"Dear	1
Natalie,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
"I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
my	1
brother	1
has	1
found	1
happiness...."	1
	1
She	1
paused,	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
telling	1
the	1
truth.	1
Natasha	1
noticed	1
this	1
and	1
guessed	1
its	1
reason.	1
	1
"I	1
think,	1
Princess,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
convenient	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
that	1
now,"	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
external	1
dignity	1
and	1
coldness,	1
though	1
she	1
felt	1
the	1
tears	1
choking	1
her.	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done?"	1
thought	1
she,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
They	1
waited	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
for	1
Natasha	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
that	1
day.	1
She	1
sat	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
crying	1
like	1
a	1
child,	1
blowing	1
her	1
nose	1
and	1
sobbing.	1
Sonya	1
stood	1
beside	1
her,	1
kissing	1
her	1
hair.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
about?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"What	1
do	1
they	1
matter	1
to	1
you?	1
It	1
will	1
all	1
pass,	1
Natasha."	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
how	1
offensive	1
it	1
was...	1
as	1
if	1
I..."	1
	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
about	1
it,	1
Natasha.	1
It	1
wasn't	1
your	1
fault	1
so	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
mind?	1
Kiss	1
me,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
Natasha	1
raised	1
her	1
head	1
and,	1
kissing	1
her	1
friend	1
on	1
the	1
lips,	1
pressed	1
her	1
wet	1
face	1
against	1
her.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you,	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
No	1
one's	1
to	1
blame,"	1
said	1
Natasha--"It's	1
my	1
fault.	1
But	1
it	1
all	1
hurts	1
terribly.	1
Oh,	1
why	1
doesn't	1
he	1
come?..."	1
	1
She	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
dinner	1
with	1
red	1
eyes.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
who	1
knew	1
how	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
pretended	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
how	1
upset	1
Natasha	1
was	1
and	1
jested	1
resolutely	1
and	1
loudly	1
at	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
guests.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
That	1
evening	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Opera,	1
for	1
which	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
box.	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
kind	1
offer	1
which	1
was	1
intended	1
expressly	1
for	1
her.	1
When	1
she	1
came	1
ready	1
dressed	1
into	1
the	1
ballroom	1
to	1
await	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
looking	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
mirror	1
there	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
pretty,	1
very	1
pretty,	1
she	1
felt	1
even	1
more	1
sad,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sweet,	1
tender	1
sadness.	1
	1
"O	1
God,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
here	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
behave	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
then,	1
but	1
differently.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
silly	1
and	1
afraid	1
of	1
things,	1
I	1
would	1
simply	1
embrace	1
him,	1
cling	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
those	1
searching	1
inquiring	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
so	1
often	1
looked	1
at	1
me,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
laugh	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
laugh.	1
And	1
his	1
eyes--how	1
I	1
see	1
those	1
eyes!"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
sister	1
matter	1
to	1
me?	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
alone,	1
him,	1
him,	1
with	1
that	1
face	1
and	1
those	1
eyes,	1
with	1
his	1
smile,	1
manly	1
and	1
yet	1
childlike....	1
No,	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
him;	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
forget	1
him,	1
quite	1
forget	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
present.	1
I	1
can't	1
bear	1
this	1
waiting	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
cry	1
in	1
a	1
minute!"	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
glass,	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
not	1
to	1
cry.	1
"And	1
how	1
can	1
Sonya	1
love	1
Nicholas	1
so	1
calmly	1
and	1
quietly	1
and	1
wait	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
so	1
patiently?"	1
thought	1
she,	1
looking	1
at	1
Sonya,	1
who	1
also	1
came	1
in	1
quite	1
ready,	1
with	1
a	1
fan	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
"No,	1
she's	1
altogether	1
different.	1
I	1
can't!"	1
	1
Natasha	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
felt	1
so	1
softened	1
and	1
tender	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
love	1
and	1
know	1
she	1
was	1
beloved,	1
she	1
wanted	1
now,	1
at	1
once,	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loved,	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
hear	1
from	1
him	1
words	1
of	1
love	1
such	1
as	1
filled	1
her	1
heart.	1
While	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
beside	1
her	1
father,	1
pensively	1
watching	1
the	1
lights	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
lamps	1
flickering	1
on	1
the	1
frozen	1
window,	1
she	1
felt	1
still	1
sadder	1
and	1
more	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
forgot	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
with	1
whom.	1
Having	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
carriages,	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
carriage	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
theater,	1
its	1
wheels	1
squeaking	1
over	1
the	1
snow.	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
holding	1
up	1
their	1
dresses,	1
jumped	1
out	1
quickly.	1
The	1
count	1
got	1
out	1
helped	1
by	1
the	1
footmen,	1
and,	1
passing	1
among	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
who	1
were	1
entering	1
and	1
the	1
program	1
sellers,	1
they	1
all	1
three	1
went	1
along	1
the	1
corridor	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
of	1
boxes.	1
Through	1
the	1
closed	1
doors	1
the	1
music	1
was	1
already	1
audible.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
your	1
hair!..."	1
whispered	1
Sonya.	1
	1
An	1
attendant	1
deferentially	1
and	1
quickly	1
slipped	1
before	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
their	1
box.	1
The	1
music	1
sounded	1
louder	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
rows	1
of	1
brightly	1
lit	1
boxes	1
in	1
which	1
ladies	1
sat	1
with	1
bare	1
arms	1
and	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
noisy	1
stalls	1
brilliant	1
with	1
uniforms,	1
glittered	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
A	1
lady	1
entering	1
the	1
next	1
box	1
shot	1
a	1
glance	1
of	1
feminine	1
envy	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
The	1
curtain	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
risen	1
and	1
the	1
overture	1
was	1
being	1
played.	1
Natasha,	1
smoothing	1
her	1
gown,	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
Sonya	1
and	1
sat	1
down,	1
scanning	1
the	1
brilliant	1
tiers	1
of	1
boxes	1
opposite.	1
A	1
sensation	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
experienced	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time--that	1
of	1
hundreds	1
of	1
eyes	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
bare	1
arms	1
and	1
neck--suddenly	1
affected	1
her	1
both	1
agreeably	1
and	1
disagreeably	1
and	1
called	1
up	1
a	1
whole	1
crowd	1
of	1
memories,	1
desires	1
and	1
emotions	1
associated	1
with	1
that	1
feeling.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
remarkably	1
pretty	1
girls,	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
with	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
attracted	1
general	1
attention.	1
Moreover,	1
everybody	1
knew	1
vaguely	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
engagement	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
had	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
ever	1
since,	1
and	1
all	1
looked	1
with	1
curiosity	1
at	1
a	1
fiancee	1
who	1
was	1
making	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
matches	1
in	1
Russia.	1
	1
Natasha's	1
looks,	1
as	1
everyone	1
told	1
her,	1
had	1
improved	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
that	1
evening	1
thanks	1
to	1
her	1
agitation	1
she	1
was	1
particularly	1
pretty.	1
She	1
struck	1
those	1
who	1
saw	1
her	1
by	1
her	1
fullness	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
beauty,	1
combined	1
with	1
her	1
indifference	1
to	1
everything	1
about	1
her.	1
Her	1
black	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
crowd	1
without	1
seeking	1
anyone,	1
and	1
her	1
delicate	1
arm,	1
bare	1
to	1
above	1
the	1
elbow,	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
velvet	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
box,	1
while,	1
evidently	1
unconsciously,	1
she	1
opened	1
and	1
closed	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
music,	1
crumpling	1
her	1
program.	1
"Look,	1
there's	1
Alenina,"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
"with	1
her	1
mother,	1
isn't	1
it?"	1
	1
"Dear	1
me,	1
Michael	1
Kirilovich	1
has	1
grown	1
still	1
stouter!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"Look	1
at	1
our	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna--what	1
a	1
headdress	1
she	1
has	1
on!"	1
	1
"The	1
Karagins,	1
Julie--and	1
Boris	1
with	1
them.	1
One	1
can	1
see	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
they're	1
engaged...."	1
	1
"Drubetskoy	1
has	1
proposed?"	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
I	1
heard	1
it	1
today,"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
box.	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
father's	1
eyes	1
were	1
turned	1
and	1
saw	1
Julie	1
sitting	1
beside	1
her	1
mother	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
pearls	1
round	1
her	1
thick	1
red	1
neck--which	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
powder.	1
Behind	1
them,	1
wearing	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
leaning	1
over	1
with	1
an	1
ear	1
to	1
Julie's	1
mouth,	1
was	1
Boris'	1
handsome	1
smoothly	1
brushed	1
head.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
said	1
something,	1
smiling,	1
to	1
his	1
betrothed.	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
us,	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
him!"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
"And	1
he	1
no	1
doubt	1
is	1
calming	1
her	1
jealousy	1
of	1
me.	1
They	1
needn't	1
trouble	1
themselves!	1
If	1
only	1
they	1
knew	1
how	1
little	1
I	1
am	1
concerned	1
about	1
any	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
Behind	1
them	1
sat	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
wearing	1
a	1
green	1
headdress	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
look	1
of	1
resignation	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
Their	1
box	1
was	1
pervaded	1
by	1
that	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
an	1
affianced	1
couple	1
which	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
liked	1
so	1
much.	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
suddenly	1
remembered	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
humiliating	1
in	1
her	1
morning's	1
visit.	1
	1
"What	1
right	1
has	1
he	1
not	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
receive	1
me	1
into	1
his	1
family?	1
Oh,	1
better	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it--not	1
till	1
he	1
comes	1
back!"	1
she	1
told	1
herself,	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
faces,	1
some	1
strange	1
and	1
some	1
familiar,	1
in	1
the	1
stalls.	1
In	1
the	1
front,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
center,	1
leaning	1
back	1
against	1
the	1
orchestra	1
rail,	1
stood	1
Dolokhov	1
in	1
a	1
Persian	1
dress,	1
his	1
curly	1
hair	1
brushed	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
huge	1
shock.	1
He	1
stood	1
in	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
audience,	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
attracting	1
everyone's	1
attention,	1
yet	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
ease	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
room.	1
Around	1
him	1
thronged	1
Moscow's	1
most	1
brilliant	1
young	1
men,	1
whom	1
he	1
evidently	1
dominated.	1
	1
The	1
count,	1
laughing,	1
nudged	1
the	1
blushing	1
Sonya	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
her	1
former	1
adorer.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
recognize	1
him?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"And	1
where	1
has	1
he	1
sprung	1
from?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
Shinshin.	1
"Didn't	1
he	1
vanish	1
somewhere?"	1
	1
"He	1
did,"	1
replied	1
Shinshin.	1
"He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Caucasus	1
and	1
ran	1
away	1
from	1
there.	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
acting	1
as	1
minister	1
to	1
some	1
ruling	1
prince	1
in	1
Persia,	1
where	1
he	1
killed	1
the	1
Shah's	1
brother.	1
Now	1
all	1
the	1
Moscow	1
ladies	1
are	1
mad	1
about	1
him!	1
It's	1
'Dolokhov	1
the	1
Persian'	1
that	1
does	1
it!	1
We	1
never	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
but	1
Dolokhov	1
is	1
mentioned.	1
They	1
swear	1
by	1
him,	1
they	1
offer	1
him	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
a	1
dish	1
of	1
choice	1
sterlet.	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
have	1
turned	1
all	1
our	1
ladies'	1
heads."	1
	1
A	1
tall,	1
beautiful	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
plaited	1
hair	1
and	1
much	1
exposed	1
plump	1
white	1
shoulders	1
and	1
neck,	1
round	1
which	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
double	1
string	1
of	1
large	1
pearls,	1
entered	1
the	1
adjoining	1
box	1
rustling	1
her	1
heavy	1
silk	1
dress	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
settling	1
into	1
her	1
place.	1
	1
Natasha	1
involuntarily	1
gazed	1
at	1
that	1
neck,	1
those	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
pearls	1
and	1
coiffure,	1
and	1
admired	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
shoulders	1
and	1
the	1
pearls.	1
While	1
Natasha	1
was	1
fixing	1
her	1
gaze	1
on	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
the	1
lady	1
looked	1
round	1
and,	1
meeting	1
the	1
count's	1
eyes,	1
nodded	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
smiled.	1
She	1
was	1
the	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova,	1
Pierre's	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
knew	1
everyone	1
in	1
society,	1
leaned	1
over	1
and	1
spoke	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
been	1
here	1
long,	1
Countess?"	1
he	1
inquired.	1
"I'll	1
call,	1
I'll	1
call	1
to	1
kiss	1
your	1
hand.	1
I'm	1
here	1
on	1
business	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
my	1
girls	1
with	1
me.	1
They	1
say	1
Semenova	1
acts	1
marvelously.	1
Count	1
Pierre	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
forget	1
us.	1
Is	1
he	1
here?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
look	1
in,"	1
answered	1
Helene,	1
and	1
glanced	1
attentively	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
resumed	1
his	1
seat.	1
	1
"Handsome,	1
isn't	1
she?"	1
he	1
whispered	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Wonderful!"	1
answered	1
Natasha.	1
"She's	1
a	1
woman	1
one	1
could	1
easily	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with."	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
the	1
last	1
chords	1
of	1
the	1
overture	1
were	1
heard	1
and	1
the	1
conductor	1
tapped	1
with	1
his	1
stick.	1
Some	1
latecomers	1
took	1
their	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
stalls,	1
and	1
the	1
curtain	1
rose.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
rose	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
boxes	1
and	1
stalls	1
became	1
silent,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men,	1
old	1
and	1
young,	1
in	1
uniform	1
and	1
evening	1
dress,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
with	1
gems	1
on	1
their	1
bare	1
flesh,	1
turned	1
their	1
whole	1
attention	1
with	1
eager	1
curiosity	1
to	1
the	1
stage.	1
Natasha	1
too	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
The	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
stage	1
consisted	1
of	1
smooth	1
boards,	1
at	1
the	1
sides	1
was	1
some	1
painted	1
cardboard	1
representing	1
trees,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
was	1
a	1
cloth	1
stretched	1
over	1
boards.	1
In	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
stage	1
sat	1
some	1
girls	1
in	1
red	1
bodices	1
and	1
white	1
skirts.	1
One	1
very	1
fat	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
silk	1
dress	1
sat	1
apart	1
on	1
a	1
low	1
bench,	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
green	1
cardboard	1
was	1
glued.	1
They	1
all	1
sang	1
something.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
finished	1
their	1
song	1
the	1
girl	1
in	1
white	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
prompter's	1
box	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
tight	1
silk	1
trousers	1
over	1
his	1
stout	1
legs,	1
and	1
holding	1
a	1
plume	1
and	1
a	1
dagger,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
began	1
singing,	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
about.	1
	1
First	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
tight	1
trousers	1
sang	1
alone,	1
then	1
she	1
sang,	1
then	1
they	1
both	1
paused	1
while	1
the	1
orchestra	1
played	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
fingered	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
girl	1
in	1
white,	1
obviously	1
awaiting	1
the	1
beat	1
to	1
start	1
singing	1
with	1
her.	1
They	1
sang	1
together	1
and	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
theater	1
began	1
clapping	1
and	1
shouting,	1
while	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
woman	1
on	1
the	1
stage--who	1
represented	1
lovers--	1
began	1
smiling,	1
spreading	1
out	1
their	1
arms,	1
and	1
bowing.	1
	1
After	1
her	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
present	1
serious	1
mood,	1
all	1
this	1
seemed	1
grotesque	1
and	1
amazing	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
follow	1
the	1
opera	1
nor	1
even	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
music;	1
she	1
saw	1
only	1
the	1
painted	1
cardboard	1
and	1
the	1
queerly	1
dressed	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
who	1
moved,	1
spoke,	1
and	1
sang	1
so	1
strangely	1
in	1
that	1
brilliant	1
light.	1
She	1
knew	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
meant	1
to	1
represent,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
pretentiously	1
false	1
and	1
unnatural	1
that	1
she	1
first	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
for	1
the	1
actors	1
and	1
then	1
amused	1
at	1
them.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
audience,	1
seeking	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
sense	1
of	1
ridicule	1
and	1
perplexity	1
she	1
herself	1
experienced,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
attentive	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
on	1
the	1
stage,	1
and	1
expressed	1
delight	1
which	1
to	1
Natasha	1
seemed	1
feigned.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
this!"	1
she	1
thought.	1
She	1
kept	1
looking	1
round	1
in	1
turn	1
at	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
pomaded	1
heads	1
in	1
the	1
stalls	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
seminude	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
boxes,	1
especially	1
at	1
Helene	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
box,	1
who--	1
apparently	1
quite	1
unclothed--sat	1
with	1
a	1
quiet	1
tranquil	1
smile,	1
not	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
stage.	1
And	1
feeling	1
the	1
bright	1
light	1
that	1
flooded	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
and	1
the	1
warm	1
air	1
heated	1
by	1
the	1
crowd,	1
Natasha	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
began	1
to	1
pass	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
intoxication	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
experienced	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
who	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
was,	1
nor	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
before	1
her.	1
As	1
she	1
looked	1
and	1
thought,	1
the	1
strangest	1
fancies	1
unexpectedly	1
and	1
disconnectedly	1
passed	1
through	1
her	1
mind:	1
the	1
idea	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
jumping	1
onto	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
singing	1
the	1
air	1
the	1
actress	1
was	1
singing,	1
then	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
touch	1
with	1
her	1
fan	1
an	1
old	1
gentleman	1
sitting	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
her,	1
then	1
to	1
lean	1
over	1
to	1
Helene	1
and	1
tickle	1
her.	1
	1
At	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
quiet	1
before	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
a	1
song,	1
a	1
door	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
stalls	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
nearest	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
box	1
creaked,	1
and	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
a	1
belated	1
arrival	1
were	1
heard.	1
"There's	1
Kuragin!"	1
whispered	1
Shinshin.	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
turned	1
smiling	1
to	1
the	1
newcomer,	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
following	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
that	1
look,	1
saw	1
an	1
exceptionally	1
handsome	1
adjutant	1
approaching	1
their	1
box	1
with	1
a	1
self-assured	1
yet	1
courteous	1
bearing.	1
This	1
was	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
noticed	1
long	1
ago	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
He	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
an	1
adjutant's	1
uniform	1
with	1
one	1
epaulet	1
and	1
a	1
shoulder	1
knot.	1
He	1
moved	1
with	1
a	1
restrained	1
swagger	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
ridiculous	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
good-looking	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
not	1
worn	1
such	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
good-humored	1
complacency	1
and	1
gaiety.	1
Though	1
the	1
performance	1
was	1
proceeding,	1
he	1
walked	1
deliberately	1
down	1
the	1
carpeted	1
gangway,	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
spurs	1
slightly	1
jingling	1
and	1
his	1
handsome	1
perfumed	1
head	1
held	1
high.	1
Having	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha	1
he	1
approached	1
his	1
sister,	1
laid	1
his	1
well	1
gloved	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
her	1
box,	1
nodded	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
leaning	1
forward	1
asked	1
a	1
question,	1
with	1
a	1
motion	1
toward	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Mais	1
charmante!"	1
said	1
he,	1
evidently	1
referring	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
exactly	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
understood	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
lips.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
of	1
the	1
stalls	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
Dolokhov,	1
nudging	1
with	1
his	1
elbow	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
and	1
offhand	1
way	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
whom	1
others	1
treated	1
so	1
fawningly.	1
He	1
winked	1
at	1
him	1
gaily,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
rested	1
his	1
foot	1
against	1
the	1
orchestra	1
screen.	1
	1
"How	1
like	1
the	1
brother	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
sister,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
count.	1
"And	1
how	1
handsome	1
they	1
both	1
are!"	1
	1
Shinshin,	1
lowering	1
his	1
voice,	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
count	1
of	1
some	1
intrigue	1
of	1
Kuragin's	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
tried	1
to	1
overhear	1
it	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
"charmante."	1
	1
The	1
first	1
act	1
was	1
over.	1
In	1
the	1
stalls	1
everyone	1
began	1
moving	1
about,	1
going	1
out	1
and	1
coming	1
in.	1
	1
Boris	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
box,	1
received	1
their	1
congratulations	1
very	1
simply,	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
with	1
an	1
absent-minded	1
smile	1
conveyed	1
to	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Sonya	1
his	1
fiancee's	1
invitation	1
to	1
her	1
wedding,	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
Natasha	1
with	1
a	1
gay,	1
coquettish	1
smile	1
talked	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
congratulated	1
on	1
his	1
approaching	1
wedding	1
that	1
same	1
Boris	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
in	1
love.	1
In	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
intoxication	1
she	1
was	1
in,	1
everything	1
seemed	1
simple	1
and	1
natural.	1
	1
The	1
scantily	1
clad	1
Helene	1
smiled	1
at	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
gave	1
Boris	1
a	1
similar	1
smile.	1
	1
Helene's	1
box	1
was	1
filled	1
and	1
surrounded	1
from	1
the	1
stalls	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
and	1
intellectual	1
men,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
vie	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
their	1
wish	1
to	1
let	1
everyone	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
her.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
entr'acte	1
Kuragin	1
stood	1
with	1
Dolokhov	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
orchestra	1
partition,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
box.	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
this	1
afforded	1
her	1
pleasure.	1
She	1
even	1
turned	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
see	1
her	1
profile	1
in	1
what	1
she	1
thought	1
was	1
its	1
most	1
becoming	1
aspect.	1
Before	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
act	1
Pierre	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
stalls.	1
The	1
Rostovs	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
their	1
arrival.	1
His	1
face	1
looked	1
sad,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
still	1
stouter	1
since	1
Natasha	1
last	1
saw	1
him.	1
He	1
passed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
rows,	1
not	1
noticing	1
anyone.	1
Anatole	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
speaking	1
to	1
him,	1
looking	1
at	1
and	1
indicating	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
box.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Natasha	1
Pierre	1
grew	1
animated	1
and,	1
hastily	1
passing	1
between	1
the	1
rows,	1
came	1
toward	1
their	1
box.	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
there	1
he	1
leaned	1
on	1
his	1
elbows	1
and,	1
smiling,	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
While	1
conversing	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
Natasha	1
heard	1
a	1
man's	1
voice	1
in	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova's	1
box	1
and	1
something	1
told	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
Kuragin.	1
She	1
turned	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
met.	1
Almost	1
smiling,	1
he	1
gazed	1
straight	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
enraptured	1
caressing	1
look	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
near	1
him,	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
like	1
that,	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
sure	1
he	1
admired	1
her,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
act	1
there	1
was	1
scenery	1
representing	1
tombstones,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
round	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
canvas	1
to	1
represent	1
the	1
moon,	1
shades	1
were	1
raised	1
over	1
the	1
footlights,	1
and	1
from	1
horns	1
and	1
contrabass	1
came	1
deep	1
notes	1
while	1
many	1
people	1
appeared	1
from	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
wearing	1
black	1
cloaks	1
and	1
holding	1
things	1
like	1
daggers	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
They	1
began	1
waving	1
their	1
arms.	1
Then	1
some	1
other	1
people	1
ran	1
in	1
and	1
began	1
dragging	1
away	1
the	1
maiden	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
white	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
light	1
blue.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
drag	1
her	1
away	1
at	1
once,	1
but	1
sang	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
last	1
dragged	1
her	1
off,	1
and	1
behind	1
the	1
scenes	1
something	1
metallic	1
was	1
struck	1
three	1
times	1
and	1
everyone	1
knelt	1
down	1
and	1
sang	1
a	1
prayer.	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
repeatedly	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
enthusiastic	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
audience.	1
	1
During	1
this	1
act	1
every	1
time	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
stalls	1
she	1
saw	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
with	1
an	1
arm	1
thrown	1
across	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
chair,	1
staring	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
captivated	1
by	1
her	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
wrong	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
second	1
act	1
was	1
over	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
rose,	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
box--her	1
whole	1
bosom	1
completely	1
exposed--beckoned	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
with	1
a	1
gloved	1
finger,	1
and	1
paying	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
her	1
box	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
amiable	1
smile.	1
	1
"Do	1
make	1
me	1
acquainted	1
with	1
your	1
charming	1
daughters,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"The	1
whole	1
town	1
is	1
singing	1
their	1
praises	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
even	1
know	1
them!"	1
	1
Natasha	1
rose	1
and	1
curtsied	1
to	1
the	1
splendid	1
countess.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
pleased	1
by	1
praise	1
from	1
this	1
brilliant	1
beauty	1
that	1
she	1
blushed	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
Moscovite	1
too,	1
now,"	1
said	1
Helene.	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
you're	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
bury	1
such	1
pearls	1
in	1
the	1
country?"	1
	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
quite	1
deserved	1
her	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
fascinating	1
woman.	1
She	1
could	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think--especially	1
what	1
was	1
flattering--quite	1
simply	1
and	1
naturally.	1
	1
"Dear	1
count,	1
you	1
must	1
let	1
me	1
look	1
after	1
your	1
daughters!	1
Though	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
staying	1
here	1
long	1
this	1
time--nor	1
are	1
you--I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
amuse	1
them.	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
heard	1
much	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
know	1
you,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
Natasha	1
with	1
her	1
stereotyped	1
and	1
lovely	1
smile.	1
"I	1
had	1
heard	1
about	1
you	1
from	1
my	1
page,	1
Drubetskoy.	1
Have	1
you	1
heard	1
he	1
is	1
getting	1
married?	1
And	1
also	1
from	1
my	1
husband's	1
friend	1
Bolkonski,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski,"	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
special	1
emphasis,	1
implying	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
To	1
get	1
better	1
acquainted	1
she	1
asked	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
her	1
box	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
performance,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
moved	1
over	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
act	1
represented	1
a	1
palace	1
in	1
which	1
many	1
candles	1
were	1
burning	1
and	1
pictures	1
of	1
knights	1
with	1
short	1
beards	1
hung	1
on	1
the	1
walls.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
stood	1
what	1
were	1
probably	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
a	1
queen.	1
The	1
king	1
waved	1
his	1
right	1
arm	1
and,	1
evidently	1
nervous,	1
sang	1
something	1
badly	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
crimson	1
throne.	1
The	1
maiden	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
first	1
in	1
white	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
light	1
blue,	1
now	1
wore	1
only	1
a	1
smock,	1
and	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
throne	1
with	1
her	1
hair	1
down.	1
She	1
sang	1
something	1
mournfully,	1
addressing	1
the	1
queen,	1
but	1
the	1
king	1
waved	1
his	1
arm	1
severely,	1
and	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
with	1
bare	1
legs	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
both	1
sides	1
and	1
began	1
dancing	1
all	1
together.	1
Then	1
the	1
violins	1
played	1
very	1
shrilly	1
and	1
merrily	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
with	1
thick	1
bare	1
legs	1
and	1
thin	1
arms,	1
separating	1
from	1
the	1
others,	1
went	1
behind	1
the	1
wings,	1
adjusted	1
her	1
bodice,	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
stage,	1
and	1
began	1
jumping	1
and	1
striking	1
one	1
foot	1
rapidly	1
against	1
the	1
other.	1
In	1
the	1
stalls	1
everyone	1
clapped	1
and	1
shouted	1
"bravo!"	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
stage.	1
The	1
cymbals	1
and	1
horns	1
in	1
the	1
orchestra	1
struck	1
up	1
more	1
loudly,	1
and	1
this	1
man	1
with	1
bare	1
legs	1
jumped	1
very	1
high	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
feet	1
about	1
very	1
rapidly.	1
(He	1
was	1
Duport,	1
who	1
received	1
sixty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year	1
for	1
this	1
art.)	1
Everybody	1
in	1
the	1
stalls,	1
boxes,	1
and	1
galleries	1
began	1
clapping	1
and	1
shouting	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
might,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
stopped	1
and	1
began	1
smiling	1
and	1
bowing	1
to	1
all	1
sides.	1
Then	1
other	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
danced	1
with	1
bare	1
legs.	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
again	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
music,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
began	1
singing.	1
But	1
suddenly	1
a	1
storm	1
came	1
on,	1
chromatic	1
scales	1
and	1
diminished	1
sevenths	1
were	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
orchestra,	1
everyone	1
ran	1
off,	1
again	1
dragging	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
curtain	1
dropped.	1
Once	1
more	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
terrible	1
noise	1
and	1
clatter	1
among	1
the	1
audience,	1
and	1
with	1
rapturous	1
faces	1
everyone	1
began	1
shouting:	1
"Duport!	1
Duport!	1
Duport!"	1
Natasha	1
no	1
longer	1
thought	1
this	1
strange.	1
She	1
looked	1
about	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
smiling	1
joyfully.	1
	1
"Isn't	1
Duport	1
delightful?"	1
Helene	1
asked	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,"	1
replied	1
Natasha.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
During	1
the	1
entr'acte	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
cold	1
air	1
came	1
into	1
Helene's	1
box,	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
Anatole	1
entered,	1
stooping	1
and	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
brush	1
against	1
anyone.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
introduce	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
Helene,	1
her	1
eyes	1
shifting	1
uneasily	1
from	1
Natasha	1
to	1
Anatole.	1
	1
Natasha	1
turned	1
her	1
pretty	1
little	1
head	1
toward	1
the	1
elegant	1
young	1
officer	1
and	1
smiled	1
at	1
him	1
over	1
her	1
bare	1
shoulder.	1
Anatole,	1
who	1
was	1
as	1
handsome	1
at	1
close	1
quarters	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
happiness--ever	1
since	1
the	1
Naryshkins'	1
ball	1
in	1
fact,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
well-remembered	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
her.	1
Kuragin	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
sensible	1
and	1
simple	1
with	1
women	1
than	1
among	1
men.	1
He	1
talked	1
boldly	1
and	1
naturally,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
was	1
strangely	1
and	1
agreeably	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
formidable	1
in	1
this	1
man	1
about	1
whom	1
there	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
talk,	1
but	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
his	1
smile	1
was	1
most	1
naive,	1
cheerful,	1
and	1
good-natured.	1
	1
Kuragin	1
asked	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
performance	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
at	1
a	1
previous	1
performance	1
Semenova	1
had	1
fallen	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
stage.	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
Countess,"	1
he	1
said,	1
suddenly	1
addressing	1
her	1
as	1
an	1
old,	1
familiar	1
acquaintance,	1
"we	1
are	1
getting	1
up	1
a	1
costume	1
tournament;	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
it!	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
great	1
fun.	1
We	1
shall	1
all	1
meet	1
at	1
the	1
Karagins'!	1
Please	1
come!	1
No!	1
Really,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
While	1
saying	1
this	1
he	1
never	1
removed	1
his	1
smiling	1
eyes	1
from	1
her	1
face,	1
her	1
neck,	1
and	1
her	1
bare	1
arms.	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
enraptured	1
by	1
her.	1
This	1
pleased	1
her,	1
yet	1
his	1
presence	1
made	1
her	1
feel	1
constrained	1
and	1
oppressed.	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
she	1
involuntarily	1
caught	1
his	1
eye	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
look	1
into	1
hers	1
rather	1
than	1
this.	1
But	1
looking	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
she	1
was	1
frightened,	1
realizing	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
barrier	1
of	1
modesty	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
between	1
herself	1
and	1
other	1
men.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
within	1
five	1
minutes	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
feel	1
herself	1
terribly	1
near	1
to	1
this	1
man.	1
When	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
she	1
feared	1
he	1
might	1
seize	1
her	1
from	1
behind	1
by	1
her	1
bare	1
arm	1
and	1
kiss	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
neck.	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
most	1
ordinary	1
things,	1
yet	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
closer	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
to	1
any	1
man.	1
Natasha	1
kept	1
turning	1
to	1
Helene	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
father,	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
what	1
it	1
all	1
meant,	1
but	1
Helene	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
a	1
general	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
her	1
look,	1
and	1
her	1
father's	1
eyes	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
always	1
said:	1
"Having	1
a	1
good	1
time?	1
Well,	1
I'm	1
glad	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
During	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
moments	1
of	1
awkward	1
silence	1
when	1
Anatole's	1
prominent	1
eyes	1
were	1
gazing	1
calmly	1
and	1
fixedly	1
at	1
her,	1
Natasha,	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
silence,	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
liked	1
Moscow.	1
She	1
asked	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
blushed.	1
She	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
by	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
improper.	1
Anatole	1
smiled	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
encourage	1
her.	1
	1
"At	1
first	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
much,	1
because	1
what	1
makes	1
a	1
town	1
pleasant	1
ce	1

les	1
jolies	1
femmes,	1
*	1
isn't	1
that	1
so?	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
like	1
it	1
very	1
much	1
indeed,"	1
he	1
said,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
significantly.	1
"You'll	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
costume	1
tournament,	1
Countess?	1
Do	1
come!"	1
and	1
putting	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
bouquet	1
and	1
dropping	1
his	1
voice,	1
he	1
added,	1
"You	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
prettiest	1
there.	1
Do	1
come,	1
dear	1
countess,	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
this	1
flower	1
as	1
a	1
pledge!"	1
	1
	1
*	1
Are	1
the	1
pretty	1
women.	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
himself,	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
incomprehensible	1
words	1
had	1
an	1
improper	1
intention.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
his	1
remark.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
turned	1
away	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
there,	1
behind,	1
so	1
close	1
behind	1
her.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
he	1
now?	1
Confused?	1
Angry?	1
Ought	1
I	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
right?"	1
she	1
asked	1
herself,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
turning	1
round.	1
She	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
his	1
nearness,	1
self-assurance,	1
and	1
the	1
good-	1
natured	1
tenderness	1
of	1
his	1
smile	1
vanquished	1
her.	1
She	1
smiled	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
doing,	1
gazing	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
eyes.	1
And	1
again	1
she	1
felt	1
with	1
horror	1
that	1
no	1
barrier	1
lay	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
her.	1
	1
The	1
curtain	1
rose	1
again.	1
Anatole	1
left	1
the	1
box,	1
serene	1
and	1
gay.	1
Natasha	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
box,	1
now	1
quite	1
submissive	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
in.	1
All	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
before	1
her	1
now	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
all	1
her	1
previous	1
thoughts	1
of	1
her	1
betrothed,	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
or	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
recur	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
and	1
were	1
as	1
if	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
remote	1
past.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
fourth	1
act	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
devil	1
who	1
sang	1
waving	1
his	1
arm	1
about,	1
till	1
the	1
boards	1
were	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
under	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
disappeared	1
down	1
below.	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
act	1
that	1
Natasha	1
saw.	1
She	1
felt	1
agitated	1
and	1
tormented,	1
and	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
was	1
Kuragin	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
watching.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
leaving	1
the	1
theater	1
Anatole	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them,	1
called	1
their	1
carriage,	1
and	1
helped	1
them	1
in.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
putting	1
Natasha	1
in	1
he	1
pressed	1
her	1
arm	1
above	1
the	1
elbow.	1
Agitated	1
and	1
flushed	1
she	1
turned	1
round.	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
glittering	1
eyes,	1
smiling	1
tenderly.	1
	1
Only	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
reached	1
home	1
was	1
Natasha	1
able	1
clearly	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
remembering	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
she	1
was	1
horrified,	1
and	1
at	1
tea	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
after	1
the	1
opera,	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
loud	1
exclamation,	1
flushed,	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"O	1
God!	1
I	1
am	1
lost!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself.	1
"How	1
could	1
I	1
let	1
him?"	1
She	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
hiding	1
her	1
flushed	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
trying	1
to	1
realize	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
was	1
unable	1
either	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
or	1
what	1
she	1
felt.	1
Everything	1
seemed	1
dark,	1
obscure,	1
and	1
terrible.	1
There	1
in	1
that	1
enormous,	1
illuminated	1
theater	1
where	1
the	1
bare-	1
legged	1
Duport,	1
in	1
a	1
tinsel-decorated	1
jacket,	1
jumped	1
about	1
to	1
the	1
music	1
on	1
wet	1
boards,	1
and	1
young	1
girls	1
and	1
old	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
nearly	1
naked	1
Helene	1
with	1
her	1
proud,	1
calm	1
smile,	1
rapturously	1
cried	1
"bravo!"--there	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
that	1
Helene	1
it	1
had	1
all	1
seemed	1
clear	1
and	1
simple;	1
but	1
now,	1
alone	1
by	1
herself,	1
it	1
was	1
incomprehensible.	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
was	1
that	1
terror	1
I	1
felt	1
of	1
him?	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
gnawing	1
of	1
conscience	1
I	1
am	1
feeling	1
now?"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
Only	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
at	1
night	1
in	1
bed	1
could	1
Natasha	1
have	1
told	1
all	1
she	1
was	1
feeling.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
Sonya	1
with	1
her	1
severe	1
and	1
simple	1
views	1
would	1
either	1
not	1
understand	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
or	1
would	1
be	1
horrified	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
confession.	1
So	1
Natasha	1
tried	1
to	1
solve	1
what	1
was	1
torturing	1
her	1
by	1
herself.	1
	1
"Am	1
I	1
spoiled	1
for	1
Andrew's	1
love	1
or	1
not?"	1
she	1
asked	1
herself,	1
and	1
with	1
soothing	1
irony	1
replied:	1
"What	1
a	1
fool	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
ask	1
that!	1
What	1
did	1
happen	1
to	1
me?	1
Nothing!	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
nothing,	1
I	1
didn't	1
lead	1
him	1
on	1
at	1
all.	1
Nobody	1
will	1
know	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
him	1
again,"	1
she	1
told	1
herself.	1
"So	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
nothing	1
has	1
happened	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
repent	1
of,	1
and	1
Andrew	1
can	1
love	1
me	1
still.	1
But	1
why	1
'still?'	1
O	1
God,	1
why	1
isn't	1
he	1
here?"	1
Natasha	1
quieted	1
herself	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
but	1
again	1
some	1
instinct	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
though	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
true,	1
and	1
though	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened,	1
yet	1
the	1
former	1
purity	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
perished.	1
And	1
again	1
in	1
imagination	1
she	1
went	1
over	1
her	1
whole	1
conversation	1
with	1
Kuragin,	1
and	1
again	1
saw	1
the	1
face,	1
gestures,	1
and	1
tender	1
smile	1
of	1
that	1
bold	1
handsome	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
pressed	1
her	1
arm.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
was	1
staying	1
in	1
Moscow	1
because	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
Petersburg,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
spending	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
cash,	1
besides	1
running	1
up	1
debts	1
for	1
as	1
much	1
more,	1
which	1
his	1
creditors	1
demanded	1
from	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
His	1
father	1
announced	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
now	1
pay	1
half	1
his	1
debts	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time,	1
but	1
only	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
as	1
adjutant	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief--a	1
post	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
procured	1
for	1
him--and	1
would	1
at	1
last	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
good	1
match	1
there.	1
He	1
indicated	1
to	1
him	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Julie	1
Karagina.	1
	1
Anatole	1
consented	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
where	1
he	1
put	1
up	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
house.	1
Pierre	1
received	1
him	1
unwillingly	1
at	1
first,	1
but	1
got	1
used	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
sometimes	1
even	1
accompanied	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
carousals,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
money	1
under	1
the	1
guise	1
of	1
loans.	1
	1
As	1
Shinshin	1
had	1
remarked,	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
Anatole	1
had	1
turned	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
ladies,	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
slighted	1
them	1
and	1
plainly	1
preferred	1
the	1
gypsy	1
girls	1
and	1
French	1
actresses--with	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
whom,	1
Mademoiselle	1
George,	1
he	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
intimate	1
relations.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
missed	1
a	1
carousal	1
at	1
Danilov's	1
or	1
other	1
Moscow	1
revelers',	1
drank	1
whole	1
nights	1
through,	1
outvying	1
everyone	1
else,	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
balls	1
and	1
parties	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
society.	1
There	1
was	1
talk	1
of	1
his	1
intrigues	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
ladies,	1
and	1
he	1
flirted	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
balls.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
run	1
after	1
the	1
unmarried	1
girls,	1
especially	1
the	1
rich	1
heiresses	1
who	1
were	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
plain.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
special	1
reason	1
for	1
this,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
married	1
two	1
years	1
before--a	1
fact	1
known	1
only	1
to	1
his	1
most	1
intimate	1
friends.	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
while	1
with	1
his	1
regiment	1
in	1
Poland,	1
a	1
Polish	1
landowner	1
of	1
small	1
means	1
had	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
his	1
daughter.	1
Anatole	1
had	1
very	1
soon	1
abandoned	1
his	1
wife	1
and,	1
for	1
a	1
payment	1
which	1
he	1
agreed	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
his	1
father-in-law,	1
had	1
arranged	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
to	1
pass	1
himself	1
off	1
as	1
a	1
bachelor.	1
	1
Anatole	1
was	1
always	1
content	1
with	1
his	1
position,	1
with	1
himself,	1
and	1
with	1
others.	1
He	1
was	1
instinctively	1
and	1
thoroughly	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
live	1
otherwise	1
than	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
done	1
anything	1
base.	1
He	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
considering	1
how	1
his	1
actions	1
might	1
affect	1
others	1
or	1
what	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
action	1
of	1
his	1
might	1
be.	1
He	1
was	1
convinced	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
duck	1
is	1
so	1
made	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
live	1
in	1
water,	1
so	1
God	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
such	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
spend	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
always	1
occupy	1
a	1
prominent	1
position	1
in	1
society.	1
He	1
believed	1
this	1
so	1
firmly	1
that	1
others,	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
were	1
persuaded	1
of	1
it	1
too	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
refuse	1
him	1
either	1
a	1
leading	1
place	1
in	1
society	1
or	1
money,	1
which	1
he	1
borrowed	1
from	1
anyone	1
and	1
everyone	1
and	1
evidently	1
would	1
not	1
repay.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
gambler,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
winning.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
vain.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
mind	1
what	1
people	1
thought	1
of	1
him.	1
Still	1
less	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
accused	1
of	1
ambition.	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
he	1
had	1
vexed	1
his	1
father	1
by	1
spoiling	1
his	1
own	1
career,	1
and	1
he	1
laughed	1
at	1
distinctions	1
of	1
all	1
kinds.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
mean,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
refuse	1
anyone	1
who	1
asked	1
of	1
him.	1
All	1
he	1
cared	1
about	1
was	1
gaiety	1
and	1
women,	1
and	1
as	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ideas	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
dishonorable	1
in	1
these	1
tastes,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
considering	1
what	1
the	1
gratification	1
of	1
his	1
tastes	1
entailed	1
for	1
others,	1
he	1
honestly	1
considered	1
himself	1
irreproachable,	1
sincerely	1
despised	1
rogues	1
and	1
bad	1
people,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
tranquil	1
conscience	1
carried	1
his	1
head	1
high.	1
	1
Rakes,	1
those	1
male	1
Magdalenes,	1
have	1
a	1
secret	1
feeling	1
of	1
innocence	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
female	1
Magdalenes	1
have,	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
hope	1
of	1
forgiveness.	1
"All	1
will	1
be	1
forgiven	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
loved	1
much;	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
much."	1
	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
had	1
reappeared	1
that	1
year	1
in	1
Moscow	1
after	1
his	1
exile	1
and	1
his	1
Persian	1
adventures,	1
and	1
was	1
leading	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
luxury,	1
gambling,	1
and	1
dissipation,	1
associated	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
Petersburg	1
comrade	1
Kuragin	1
and	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
ends.	1
	1
Anatole	1
was	1
sincerely	1
fond	1
of	1
Dolokhov	1
for	1
his	1
cleverness	1
and	1
audacity.	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
needed	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin's	1
name,	1
position,	1
and	1
connections	1
as	1
a	1
bait	1
to	1
draw	1
rich	1
young	1
men	1
into	1
his	1
gambling	1
set,	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
amused	1
himself	1
at	1
his	1
expense	1
without	1
letting	1
the	1
other	1
feel	1
it.	1
Apart	1
from	1
the	1
advantage	1
he	1
derived	1
from	1
Anatole,	1
the	1
very	1
process	1
of	1
dominating	1
another's	1
will	1
was	1
in	1
itself	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
a	1
habit,	1
and	1
a	1
necessity	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1

had	1
made	1
a	1
strong	1
impression	1
on	1
Kuragin.	1
At	1
supper	1
after	1
the	1
opera	1
he	1
described	1
to	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
connoisseur	1
the	1
attractions	1
of	1
her	1
arms,	1
shoulders,	1
feet,	1
and	1
hair	1
and	1
expressed	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
making	1
love	1
to	1
her.	1
Anatole	1
had	1
no	1
notion	1
and	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
considering	1
what	1
might	1
come	1
of	1
such	1
love-making,	1
as	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
actions.	1
	1
"She's	1
first-rate,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
us,"	1
replied	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
my	1
sister	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
to	1
dinner,"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
"Eh?"	1
	1
"You'd	1
better	1
wait	1
till	1
she's	1
married...."	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
I	1
adore	1
little	1
girls,	1
they	1
lose	1
their	1
heads	1
at	1
once,"	1
pursued	1
Anatole.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
caught	1
once	1
already	1
by	1
a	1
'little	1
girl,'"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
who	1
knew	1
of	1
Kuragin's	1
marriage.	1
"Take	1
care!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
that	1
can't	1
happen	1
twice!	1
Eh?"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
with	1
a	1
good-humored	1
laugh.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
opera	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
went	1
nowhere	1
and	1
nobody	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
about	1
something	1
which	1
they	1
concealed	1
from	1
Natasha.	1
Natasha	1
guessed	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
planning	1
something,	1
and	1
this	1
disquieted	1
and	1
offended	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
expecting	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
any	1
moment	1
and	1
twice	1
that	1
day	1
sent	1
a	1
manservant	1
to	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
come.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
arrived.	1
She	1
suffered	1
more	1
now	1
than	1
during	1
her	1
first	1
days	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
To	1
her	1
impatience	1
and	1
pining	1
for	1
him	1
were	1
now	1
added	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
recollection	1
of	1
her	1
interview	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
and	1
a	1
fear	1
and	1
anxiety	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
cause.	1
She	1
continually	1
fancied	1
that	1
either	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
or	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
her	1
before	1
he	1
came.	1
She	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
herself	1
calmly	1
and	1
continuously	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
before.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
him,	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
of	1
the	1
theater,	1
and	1
of	1
Kuragin	1
mingled	1
with	1
her	1
thoughts.	1
The	1
question	1
again	1
presented	1
itself	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
guilty,	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
already	1
broken	1
faith	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
recalling	1
to	1
the	1
minutest	1
detail	1
every	1
word,	1
every	1
gesture,	1
and	1
every	1
shade	1
in	1
the	1
play	1
of	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
arouse	1
in	1
her	1
such	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
and	1
terrifying	1
feeling.	1
To	1
the	1
family	1
Natasha	1
seemed	1
livelier	1
than	1
usual,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
far	1
less	1
tranquil	1
and	1
happy	1
than	1
before.	1
	1
On	1
Sunday	1
morning	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
invited	1
her	1
visitors	1
to	1
Mass	1
at	1
her	1
parish	1
church--the	1
Church	1
of	1
the	1
Assumption	1
built	1
over	1
the	1
graves	1
of	1
victims	1
of	1
the	1
plague.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
those	1
fashionable	1
churches,"	1
she	1
said,	1
evidently	1
priding	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
independence	1
of	1
thought.	1
"God	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
everywhere.	1
We	1
have	1
an	1
excellent	1
priest,	1
he	1
conducts	1
the	1
service	1
decently	1
and	1
with	1
dignity,	1
and	1
the	1
deacon	1
is	1
the	1
same.	1
What	1
holiness	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
giving	1
concerts	1
in	1
the	1
choir?	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
it,	1
it's	1
just	1
self-indulgence!"	1
	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
liked	1
Sundays	1
and	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
keep	1
them.	1
Her	1
whole	1
house	1
was	1
scrubbed	1
and	1
cleaned	1
on	1
Saturdays;	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
the	1
servants	1
worked,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
wore	1
holiday	1
dress	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
church.	1
At	1
her	1
table	1
there	1
were	1
extra	1
dishes	1
at	1
dinner,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
had	1
vodka	1
and	1
roast	1
goose	1
or	1
suckling	1
pig.	1
But	1
in	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
holiday	1
so	1
noticeable	1
as	1
in	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
broad,	1
stern	1
face,	1
which	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
wore	1
an	1
invariable	1
look	1
of	1
solemn	1
festivity.	1
	1
After	1
Mass,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
finished	1
their	1
coffee	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
loose	1
covers	1
had	1
been	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
furniture,	1
a	1
servant	1
announced	1
that	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
ready,	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
rose	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
air.	1
She	1
wore	1
her	1
holiday	1
shawl,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
paid	1
calls,	1
and	1
announced	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
explanation	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
Natasha.	1
	1
After	1
she	1
had	1
gone,	1
a	1
dressmaker	1
from	1
Madame	1
Suppert-Roguet	1
waited	1
on	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
this	1
diversion,	1
having	1
shut	1
herself	1
into	1
a	1
room	1
adjoining	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
occupied	1
herself	1
trying	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
dresses.	1
Just	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
bodice	1
without	1
sleeves	1
and	1
only	1
tacked	1
together,	1
and	1
was	1
turning	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
how	1
the	1
back	1
fitted,	1
she	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
animated	1
sounds	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
voice	1
and	1
another's--a	1
woman's--that	1
made	1
her	1
flush.	1
It	1
was	1
Helene.	1
Natasha	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
bodice	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova,	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
purple	1
velvet	1
gown	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
collar,	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
beaming	1
with	1
good-humored	1
amiable	1
smiles.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
enchantress!"	1
she	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
blushing	1
Natasha.	1
"Charming!	1
No,	1
this	1
is	1
really	1
beyond	1
anything,	1
my	1
dear	1
count,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
her	1
in.	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
live	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
go	1
nowhere?	1
No,	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
you	1
off!	1
Mademoiselle	1
George	1
will	1
recite	1
at	1
my	1
house	1
tonight	1
and	1
there'll	1
be	1
some	1
people,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
bring	1
your	1
lovely	1
girls--	1
who	1
are	1
prettier	1
than	1
Mademoiselle	1
George--I	1
won't	1
know	1
you!	1
My	1
husband	1
is	1
away	1
in	1
Tver	1
or	1
I	1
would	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
fetch	1
you.	1
You	1
must	1
come.	1
You	1
positively	1
must!	1
Between	1
eight	1
and	1
nine."	1
	1
She	1
nodded	1
to	1
the	1
dressmaker,	1
whom	1
she	1
knew	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
curtsied	1
respectfully	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
seated	1
herself	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
beside	1
the	1
looking	1
glass,	1
draping	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
velvet	1
dress	1
picturesquely.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
chattering	1
good-naturedly	1
and	1
gaily,	1
continually	1
praising	1
Natasha's	1
beauty.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha's	1
dresses	1
and	1
praised	1
them,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
new	1
dress	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
made	1
of	1
"metallic	1
gauze,"	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
Paris,	1
and	1
advised	1
Natasha	1
to	1
have	1
one	1
like	1
it.	1
	1
"But	1
anything	1
suits	1
you,	1
my	1
charmer!"	1
she	1
remarked.	1
	1
A	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
never	1
left	1
Natasha's	1
face.	1
She	1
felt	1
happy	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
blossoming	1
under	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
this	1
dear	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
unapproachable	1
and	1
important	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
kind	1
to	1
her.	1
Natasha	1
brightened	1
up	1
and	1
felt	1
almost	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
this	1
woman,	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
beautiful	1
and	1
so	1
kind.	1
Helene	1
for	1
her	1
part	1
was	1
sincerely	1
delighted	1
with	1
Natasha	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
good	1
time.	1
Anatole	1
had	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
and	1
Natasha	1
together,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
for	1
that	1
purpose.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
throwing	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
Natasha	1
together	1
amused	1
her.	1
	1
Though	1
at	1
one	1
time,	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
annoyed	1
with	1
Natasha	1
for	1
drawing	1
Boris	1
away,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
now,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
way	1
heartily	1
wished	1
Natasha	1
well.	1
As	1
she	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
protegee	1
aside.	1
	1
"My	1
brother	1
dined	1
with	1
me	1
yesterday--we	1
nearly	1
died	1
of	1
laughter--he	1
ate	1
nothing	1
and	1
kept	1
sighing	1
for	1
you,	1
my	1
charmer!	1
He	1
is	1
madly,	1
quite	1
madly,	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
dear."	1
	1
Natasha	1
blushed	1
scarlet	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
this.	1
	1
"How	1
she	1
blushes,	1
how	1
she	1
blushes,	1
my	1
pretty!"	1
said	1
Helene.	1
"You	1
must	1
certainly	1
come.	1
If	1
you	1
love	1
somebody,	1
my	1
charmer,	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
reason	1
to	1
shut	1
yourself	1
up.	1
Even	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
engaged,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
your	1
fiance	1
would	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
society	1
rather	1
than	1
be	1
bored	1
to	1
death."	1
	1
"So	1
she	1
knows	1
I	1
am	1
engaged,	1
and	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
Pierre--that	1
good	1
Pierre--have	1
talked	1
and	1
laughed	1
about	1
this.	1
So	1
it's	1
all	1
right."	1
And	1
again,	1
under	1
Helene's	1
influence,	1
what	1
had	1
seemed	1
terrible	1
now	1
seemed	1
simple	1
and	1
natural.	1
"And	1
she	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
grande	1
dame,	1
so	1
kind,	1
and	1
evidently	1
likes	1
me	1
so	1
much.	1
And	1
why	1
not	1
enjoy	1
myself?"	1
thought	1
Natasha,	1
gazing	1
at	1
Helene	1
with	1
wide-open,	1
wondering	1
eyes.	1
	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
dinner	1
taciturn	1
and	1
serious,	1
having	1
evidently	1
suffered	1
a	1
defeat	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
prince's.	1
She	1
was	1
still	1
too	1
agitated	1
by	1
the	1
encounter	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
calmly.	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
inquiries	1
she	1
replied	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
all	1
right	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
about	1
it	1
next	1
day.	1
On	1
hearing	1
of	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova's	1
visit	1
and	1
the	1
invitation	1
for	1
that	1
evening,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
remarked:	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
care	1
to	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
Bezukhova	1
and	1
don't	1
advise	1
you	1
to;	1
however,	1
if	1
you've	1
promised--go.	1
It	1
will	1
divert	1
your	1
thoughts,"	1
she	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Natasha.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
girls	1
to	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova's.	1
There	1
were	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
people	1
there,	1
but	1
nearly	1
all	1
strangers	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
was	1
displeased	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
company	1
consisted	1
almost	1
entirely	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
known	1
for	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
their	1
conduct.	1
Mademoiselle	1
George	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
surrounded	1
by	1
young	1
men.	1
There	1
were	1
several	1
Frenchmen	1
present,	1
among	1
them	1
Metivier	1
who	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
Helene	1
reached	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
intimate	1
in	1
her	1
house.	1
The	1
count	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
cards	1
or	1
let	1
his	1
girls	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Mademoiselle	1
George's	1
performance	1
was	1
over.	1
	1
Anatole	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
evidently	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
Immediately	1
after	1
greeting	1
the	1
count	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Natasha	1
and	1
followed	1
her.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
opera--gratified	1
vanity	1
at	1
his	1
admiration	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
fear	1
at	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
a	1
moral	1
barrier	1
between	1
them.	1
	1
Helene	1
welcomed	1
Natasha	1
delightedly	1
and	1
was	1
loud	1
in	1
admiration	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
her	1
dress.	1
Soon	1
after	1
their	1
arrival	1
Mademoiselle	1
George	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
costume.	1
In	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
people	1
began	1
arranging	1
the	1
chairs	1
and	1
taking	1
their	1
seats.	1
Anatole	1
moved	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
Natasha	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
beside	1
her,	1
but	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
never	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
her,	1
took	1
the	1
seat	1
himself.	1
Anatole	1
sat	1
down	1
behind	1
her.	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
George,	1
with	1
her	1
bare,	1
fat,	1
dimpled	1
arms,	1
and	1
a	1
red	1
shawl	1
draped	1
over	1
one	1
shoulder,	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
space	1
left	1
vacant	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
assumed	1
an	1
unnatural	1
pose.	1
Enthusiastic	1
whispering	1
was	1
audible.	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
George	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
gloomily	1
at	1
the	1
audience	1
and	1
began	1
reciting	1
some	1
French	1
verses	1
describing	1
her	1
guilty	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
son.	1
In	1
some	1
places	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
voice,	1
in	1
others	1
she	1
whispered,	1
lifting	1
her	1
head	1
triumphantly;	1
sometimes	1
she	1
paused	1
and	1
uttered	1
hoarse	1
sounds,	1
rolling	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Adorable!	1
divine!	1
delicious!"	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fat	1
actress,	1
but	1
neither	1
saw	1
nor	1
heard	1
nor	1
understood	1
anything	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
before	1
her.	1
She	1
only	1
felt	1
herself	1
again	1
completely	1
borne	1
away	1
into	1
this	1
strange	1
senseless	1
world--so	1
remote	1
from	1
her	1
old	1
world--a	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
reasonable	1
or	1
senseless.	1
Behind	1
her	1
sat	1
Anatole,	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
proximity	1
she	1
experienced	1
a	1
frightened	1
sense	1
of	1
expectancy.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
first	1
monologue	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
rose	1
and	1
surrounded	1
Mademoiselle	1
George,	1
expressing	1
their	1
enthusiasm.	1
	1
"How	1
beautiful	1
she	1
is!"	1
Natasha	1
remarked	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
risen	1
and	1
was	1
moving	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
toward	1
the	1
actress.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
so	1
when	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
you!"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
following	1
Natasha.	1
He	1
said	1
this	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
she	1
alone	1
could	1
hear	1
him.	1
"You	1
are	1
enchanting...	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
ceased..."	1
	1
"Come,	1
come,	1
Natasha!"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
for	1
his	1
daughter.	1
"How	1
beautiful	1
she	1
is!"	1
Natasha	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
stepped	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
surprised	1
inquiring	1
eyes.	1
	1
After	1
giving	1
several	1
recitations,	1
Mademoiselle	1
George	1
left,	1
and	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
asked	1
her	1
visitors	1
into	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
home,	1
but	1
Helene	1
entreated	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
spoil	1
her	1
improvised	1
ball,	1
and	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
stayed	1
on.	1
Anatole	1
asked	1
Natasha	1
for	1
a	1
valse	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
danced	1
he	1
pressed	1
her	1
waist	1
and	1
hand	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
bewitching	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
her.	1
During	1
the	1
ecossaise,	1
which	1
she	1
also	1
danced	1
with	1
him,	1
Anatole	1
said	1
nothing	1
when	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
themselves,	1
but	1
merely	1
gazed	1
at	1
her.	1
Natasha	1
lifted	1
her	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
confident	1
tenderness	1
in	1
his	1
affectionate	1
look	1
and	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not,	1
whilst	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
say.	1
She	1
lowered	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Don't	1
say	1
such	1
things	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
betrothed	1
and	1
love	1
another,"	1
she	1
said	1
rapidly....	1
She	1
glanced	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
Anatole	1
was	1
not	1
upset	1
or	1
pained	1
by	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
"Don't	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
that!	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
do?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
madly,	1
madly,	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you!	1
Is	1
it	1
my	1
fault	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
enchanting?...	1
It's	1
our	1
turn	1
to	1
begin."	1
	1
Natasha,	1
animated	1
and	1
excited,	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
with	1
wide-open	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
and	1
seemed	1
merrier	1
than	1
usual.	1
She	1
understood	1
hardly	1
anything	1
that	1
went	1
on	1
that	1
evening.	1
They	1
danced	1
the	1
ecossaise	1
and	1
the	1
Grossvater.	1
Her	1
father	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
home,	1
but	1
she	1
begged	1
to	1
remain.	1
Wherever	1
she	1
went	1
and	1
whomever	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
to,	1
she	1
felt	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
her.	1
Later	1
on	1
she	1
recalled	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
asked	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
dressing	1
room	1
to	1
rearrange	1
her	1
dress,	1
that	1
Helene	1
had	1
followed	1
her	1
and	1
spoken	1
laughingly	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
love,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
again	1
met	1
Anatole	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
sitting	1
room.	1
Helene	1
had	1
disappeared	1
leaving	1
them	1
alone,	1
and	1
Anatole	1
had	1
taken	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tender	1
voice:	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
come	1
to	1
visit	1
you	1
but	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
you?	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
madly.	1
Can	1
I	1
never...?"	1
and,	1
blocking	1
her	1
path,	1
he	1
brought	1
his	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
hers.	1
	1
His	1
large,	1
glittering,	1
masculine	1
eyes	1
were	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
hers	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
them.	1
	1
"Natalie?"	1
he	1
whispered	1
inquiringly	1
while	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
hands	1
being	1
painfully	1
pressed.	1
"Natalie?"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say,"	1
her	1
eyes	1
replied.	1
	1
Burning	1
lips	1
were	1
pressed	1
to	1
hers,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
released,	1
and	1
Helene's	1
footsteps	1
and	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
were	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
then,	1
red	1
and	1
trembling,	1
threw	1
a	1
frightened	1
look	1
of	1
inquiry	1
at	1
Anatole	1
and	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"One	1
word,	1
just	1
one,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
cried	1
Anatole.	1
	1
She	1
paused.	1
She	1
so	1
wanted	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
would	1
explain	1
to	1
her	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
"Natalie,	1
just	1
a	1
word,	1
only	1
one!"	1
he	1
kept	1
repeating,	1
evidently	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
he	1
repeated	1
it	1
till	1
Helene	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
Helene	1
returned	1
with	1
Natasha	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
Rostovs	1
went	1
away	1
without	1
staying	1
for	1
supper.	1
	1
After	1
reaching	1
home	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
all	1
night.	1
She	1
was	1
tormented	1
by	1
the	1
insoluble	1
question	1
whether	1
she	1
loved	1
Anatole	1
or	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
She	1
loved	1
Prince	1
Andrew--she	1
remembered	1
distinctly	1
how	1
deeply	1
she	1
loved	1
him.	1
But	1
she	1
also	1
loved	1
Anatole,	1
of	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
doubt.	1
"Else	1
how	1
could	1
all	1
this	1
have	1
happened?"	1
thought	1
she.	1
"If,	1
after	1
that,	1
I	1
could	1
return	1
his	1
smile	1
when	1
saying	1
good-by,	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
that,	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
I	1
loved	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
It	1
means	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
kind,	1
noble,	1
and	1
splendid,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
loving	1
him.	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
too?"	1
she	1
asked	1
herself,	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
these	1
terrible	1
questions.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
Morning	1
came	1
with	1
its	1
cares	1
and	1
bustle.	1
Everyone	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
about	1
and	1
talk,	1
dressmakers	1
came	1
again.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
appeared,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
to	1
breakfast.	1
Natasha	1
kept	1
looking	1
uneasily	1
at	1
everybody	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes,	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
intercept	1
every	1
glance	1
directed	1
toward	1
her,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
appear	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
usual.	1
	1
After	1
breakfast,	1
which	1
was	1
her	1
best	1
time,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
armchair	1
and	1
called	1
Natasha	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Well,	1
friends,	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
thought	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
over	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
advice,"	1
she	1
began.	1
"Yesterday,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski.	1
Well,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
him....	1
He	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
begin	1
shouting,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
shouted	1
down.	1
I	1
said	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
say!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
he?"	1
asked	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"He?	1
He's	1
crazy...	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
listen.	1
But	1
what's	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking?	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
have	1
worn	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
out,"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
"My	1
advice	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
finish	1
your	1
business	1
and	1
go	1
back	1
home	1
to	1
Otradnoe...	1
and	1
wait	1
there."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no!"	1
exclaimed	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
go	1
back,"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
"and	1
wait	1
there.	1
If	1
your	1
betrothed	1
comes	1
here	1
now--there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
avoiding	1
a	1
quarrel;	1
but	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
he	1
will	1
talk	1
things	1
over	1
and	1
then	1
come	1
on	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
approved	1
of	1
this	1
suggestion,	1
appreciating	1
its	1
reasonableness.	1
If	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
came	1
round	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
in	1
Moscow	1
or	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
later	1
on;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
the	1
wedding,	1
against	1
his	1
wishes,	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
arranged	1
at	1
Otradnoe.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
perfectly	1
true.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
her,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count.	1
	1
"No,	1
why	1
be	1
sorry?	1
Being	1
here,	1
you	1
had	1
to	1
pay	1
your	1
respects.	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
won't--that's	1
his	1
affair,"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
looking	1
for	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
reticule.	1
"Besides,	1
the	1
trousseau	1
is	1
ready,	1
so	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
wait	1
for;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
not	1
ready	1
I'll	1
send	1
after	1
you.	1
Though	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
letting	1
you	1
go,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
way.	1
So	1
go,	1
with	1
God's	1
blessing!"	1
	1
Having	1
found	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
reticule	1
she	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"She	1
has	1
written	1
to	1
you.	1
How	1
she	1
torments	1
herself,	1
poor	1
thing!	1
She's	1
afraid	1
you	1
might	1
think	1
that	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
you."	1
	1
"But	1
she	1
doesn't	1
like	1
me,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
nonsense!"	1
cried	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
"I	1
shan't	1
believe	1
anyone,	1
I	1
know	1
she	1
doesn't	1
like	1
me,"	1
replied	1
Natasha	1
boldly	1
as	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
expressed	1
a	1
cold	1
and	1
angry	1
resolution	1
that	1
caused	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
more	1
intently	1
and	1
to	1
frown.	1
	1
"Don't	1
answer	1
like	1
that,	1
my	1
good	1
girl!"	1
she	1
said.	1
"What	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
true!	1
Write	1
an	1
answer!"	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
to	1
read	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
letter.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
wrote	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
despair	1
at	1
the	1
misunderstanding	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
between	1
them.	1
Whatever	1
her	1
father's	1
feelings	1
might	1
be,	1
she	1
begged	1
Natasha	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
loving	1
her	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
chosen	1
by	1
her	1
brother,	1
for	1
whose	1
happiness	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
everything.	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
think,	1
however,"	1
she	1
wrote,	1
"that	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
ill-disposed	1
toward	1
you.	1
He	1
is	1
an	1
invalid	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
must	1
be	1
forgiven;	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
magnanimous	1
and	1
will	1
love	1
her	1
who	1
makes	1
his	1
son	1
happy."	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
ask	1
Natasha	1
to	1
fix	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
again.	1
	1
After	1
reading	1
the	1
letter	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
to	1
answer	1
it.	1
"Dear	1
Princess,"	1
she	1
wrote	1
in	1
French	1
quickly	1
and	1
mechanically,	1
and	1
then	1
paused.	1
What	1
more	1
could	1
she	1
write	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
the	1
evening	1
before?	1
"Yes,	1
yes!	1
All	1
that	1
has	1
happened,	1
and	1
now	1
all	1
is	1
changed,"	1
she	1
thought	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
had	1
begun	1
before	1
her.	1
"Must	1
I	1
break	1
off	1
with	1
him?	1
Must	1
I	1
really?	1
That's	1
awful..."	1
and	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
these	1
dreadful	1
thoughts	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
Sonya	1
and	1
began	1
sorting	1
patterns	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
After	1
dinner	1
Natasha	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
again	1
took	1
up	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
letter.	1
"Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over?"	1
she	1
thought.	1
"Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
has	1
happened	1
so	1
quickly	1
and	1
has	1
destroyed	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
before?"	1
She	1
recalled	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
former	1
strength,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
Kuragin.	1
She	1
vividly	1
pictured	1
herself	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
scenes	1
of	1
happiness	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
repeated	1
in	1
her	1
imagination,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
aglow	1
with	1
excitement,	1
recalled	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
yesterday's	1
interview	1
with	1
Anatole.	1
	1
"Why	1
could	1
that	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
well?"	1
she	1
sometimes	1
asked	1
herself	1
in	1
complete	1
bewilderment.	1
"Only	1
so	1
could	1
I	1
be	1
completely	1
happy;	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
choose,	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
be	1
happy	1
without	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
Only,"	1
she	1
thought,	1
"to	1
tell	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
or	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
him	1
are	1
both	1
equally	1
impossible.	1
But	1
with	1
that	1
one	1
nothing	1
is	1
spoiled.	1
But	1
am	1
I	1
really	1
to	1
abandon	1
forever	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
love,	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
so	1
long?"	1
	1
"Please,	1
Miss!"	1
whispered	1
a	1
maid	1
entering	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
mysterious	1
air.	1
"A	1
man	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
this-"	1
and	1
she	1
handed	1
Natasha	1
a	1
letter.	1
	1
"Only,	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake..."	1
the	1
girl	1
went	1
on,	1
as	1
Natasha,	1
without	1
thinking,	1
mechanically	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
and	1
read	1
a	1
love	1
letter	1
from	1
Anatole,	1
of	1
which,	1
without	1
taking	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
she	1
understood	1
only	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him--from	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loved.	1
Yes,	1
she	1
loved	1
him,	1
or	1
else	1
how	1
could	1
that	1
have	1
happened	1
which	1
had	1
happened?	1
And	1
how	1
could	1
she	1
have	1
a	1
love	1
letter	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
hand?	1
	1
With	1
trembling	1
hands	1
Natasha	1
held	1
that	1
passionate	1
love	1
letter	1
which	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
composed	1
for	1
Anatole,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
read	1
it	1
she	1
found	1
in	1
it	1
an	1
echo	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
imagined	1
she	1
was	1
feeling.	1
	1
"Since	1
yesterday	1
evening	1
my	1
fate	1
has	1
been	1
sealed;	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
by	1
you	1
or	1
to	1
die.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
for	1
me,"	1
the	1
letter	1
began.	1
Then	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
parents	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
him--for	1
this	1
there	1
were	1
secret	1
reasons	1
he	1
could	1
reveal	1
only	1
to	1
her--but	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
she	1
need	1
only	1
say	1
the	1
word	1
yes,	1
and	1
no	1
human	1
power	1
could	1
hinder	1
their	1
bliss.	1
Love	1
would	1
conquer	1
all.	1
He	1
would	1
steal	1
her	1
away	1
and	1
carry	1
her	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes!	1
I	1
love	1
him!"	1
thought	1
Natasha,	1
reading	1
the	1
letter	1
for	1
the	1
twentieth	1
time	1
and	1
finding	1
some	1
peculiarly	1
deep	1
meaning	1
in	1
each	1
word	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
That	1
evening	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
Akharovs'	1
and	1
proposed	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
girls	1
with	1
her.	1
Natasha,	1
pleading	1
a	1
headache,	1
remained	1
at	1
home.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
On	1
returning	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
Sonya	1
went	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
room,	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
surprise	1
found	1
her	1
still	1
dressed	1
and	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
Open	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
beside	1
her	1
lay	1
Anatole's	1
letter.	1
Sonya	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
read	1
it.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
read	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
sleeping	1
Natasha,	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
reading,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
it.	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
calm,	1
gentle,	1
and	1
happy.	1
Clutching	1
her	1
breast	1
to	1
keep	1
herself	1
from	1
choking,	1
Sonya,	1
pale	1
and	1
trembling	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
agitation,	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
"How	1
was	1
it	1
I	1
noticed	1
nothing?	1
How	1
could	1
it	1
go	1
so	1
far?	1
Can	1
she	1
have	1
left	1
off	1
loving	1
Prince	1
Andrew?	1
And	1
how	1
could	1
she	1
let	1
Kuragin	1
go	1
to	1
such	1
lengths?	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
deceiver	1
and	1
a	1
villain,	1
that's	1
plain!	1
What	1
will	1
Nicholas,	1
dear	1
noble	1
Nicholas,	1
do	1
when	1
he	1
hears	1
of	1
it?	1
So	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
her	1
excited,	1
resolute,	1
unnatural	1
look	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday,	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
today,"	1
thought	1
Sonya.	1
"But	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
that	1
she	1
loves	1
him!	1
She	1
probably	1
opened	1
the	1
letter	1
without	1
knowing	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
from.	1
Probably	1
she	1
is	1
offended	1
by	1
it.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
such	1
a	1
thing!"	1
	1
Sonya	1
wiped	1
away	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
again	1
scanning	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
"Natasha!"	1
she	1
said,	1
just	1
audibly.	1
	1
Natasha	1
awoke	1
and	1
saw	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you're	1
back?"	1
	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
decision	1
and	1
tenderness	1
that	1
often	1
come	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
awakening,	1
she	1
embraced	1
her	1
friend,	1
but	1
noticing	1
Sonya's	1
look	1
of	1
embarrassment,	1
her	1
own	1
face	1
expressed	1
confusion	1
and	1
suspicion.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
you've	1
read	1
that	1
letter?"	1
she	1
demanded.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
Sonya	1
softly.	1
	1
Natasha	1
smiled	1
rapturously.	1
	1
"No,	1
Sonya,	1
I	1
can't	1
any	1
longer!"	1
she	1
said.	1
"I	1
can't	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
you	1
any	1
longer.	1
You	1
know,	1
we	1
love	1
one	1
another!	1
Sonya,	1
darling,	1
he	1
writes...	1
Sonya..."	1
	1
Sonya	1
stared	1
open-eyed	1
at	1
Natasha,	1
unable	1
to	1
believe	1
her	1
ears.	1
	1
"And	1
Bolkonski?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Sonya,	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
am!"	1
cried	1
Natasha.	1
"You	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
love	1
is...."	1
	1
"But,	1
Natasha,	1
can	1
that	1
be	1
all	1
over?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
Sonya	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
grasp	1
the	1
question.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
are	1
you	1
refusing	1
Prince	1
Andrew?"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
don't	1
understand	1
anything!	1
Don't	1
talk	1
nonsense,	1
just	1
listen!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
momentary	1
vexation.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
can't	1
believe	1
it,"	1
insisted	1
Sonya.	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
loved	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
year	1
and	1
suddenly...	1
Why,	1
you	1
have	1
only	1
seen	1
him	1
three	1
times!	1
Natasha,	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
you,	1
you're	1
joking!	1
In	1
three	1
days	1
to	1
forget	1
everything	1
and	1
so..."	1
	1
"Three	1
days?"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
I've	1
loved	1
him	1
a	1
hundred	1
years.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
loved	1
anyone	1
before.	1
You	1
can't	1
understand	1
it....	1
Sonya,	1
wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
sit	1
here,"	1
and	1
Natasha	1
embraced	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
happens	1
like	1
this,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
too,	1
but	1
it's	1
only	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
such	1
love.	1
It's	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
before.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
I	1
felt	1
he	1
was	1
my	1
master	1
and	1
I	1
his	1
slave,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
loving	1
him.	1
Yes,	1
his	1
slave!	1
Whatever	1
he	1
orders	1
I	1
shall	1
do.	1
You	1
don't	1
understand	1
that.	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
do?	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
do,	1
Sonya?"	1
cried	1
Natasha	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
yet	1
frightened	1
expression.	1
	1
"But	1
think	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing,"	1
cried	1
Sonya.	1
"I	1
can't	1
leave	1
it	1
like	1
this.	1
This	1
secret	1
correspondence...	1
How	1
could	1
you	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
so	1
far?"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
with	1
a	1
horror	1
and	1
disgust	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
conceal.	1
	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
will,"	1
Natasha	1
replied.	1
"Why	1
can't	1
you	1
understand?	1
I	1
love	1
him!"	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
that...	1
I	1
shall	1
tell!"	1
cried	1
Sonya,	1
bursting	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?	1
For	1
God's	1
sake...	1
If	1
you	1
tell,	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
enemy!"	1
declared	1
Natasha.	1
"You	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
miserable,	1
you	1
want	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
separated...."	1
	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
Natasha's	1
fright,	1
Sonya	1
shed	1
tears	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
friend.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
between	1
you?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"What	1
has	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
you?	1
Why	1
doesn't	1
he	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
house?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
her	1
questions.	1
	1
"For	1
God's	1
sake,	1
Sonya,	1
don't	1
tell	1
anyone,	1
don't	1
torture	1
me,"	1
Natasha	1
entreated.	1
"Remember	1
no	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
interfere	1
in	1
such	1
matters!	1
I	1
have	1
confided	1
in	1
you...."	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
this	1
secrecy?	1
Why	1
doesn't	1
he	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
house?"	1
asked	1
Sonya.	1
"Why	1
doesn't	1
he	1
openly	1
ask	1
for	1
your	1
hand?	1
You	1
know	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gave	1
you	1
complete	1
freedom--if	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
so;	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
it!	1
Natasha,	1
have	1
you	1
considered	1
what	1
these	1
secret	1
reasons	1
can	1
be?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
Sonya	1
with	1
astonishment.	1
Evidently	1
this	1
question	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
answer	1
it.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
reasons	1
are.	1
But	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
reasons!"	1
	1
Sonya	1
sighed	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
incredulously.	1
	1
"If	1
there	1
were	1
reasons..."	1
she	1
began.	1
	1
But	1
Natasha,	1
guessing	1
her	1
doubts,	1
interrupted	1
her	1
in	1
alarm.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
one	1
can't	1
doubt	1
him!	1
One	1
can't,	1
one	1
can't!	1
Don't	1
you	1
understand?"	1
she	1
cried.	1
	1
"Does	1
he	1
love	1
you?"	1
	1
"Does	1
he	1
love	1
me?"	1
Natasha	1
repeated	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pity	1
at	1
her	1
friend's	1
lack	1
of	1
comprehension.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
have	1
read	1
his	1
letter	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
him."	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
dishonorable?"	1
	1
"He!	1
dishonorable?	1
If	1
you	1
only	1
knew!"	1
exclaimed	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
honorable	1
man	1
he	1
should	1
either	1
declare	1
his	1
intentions	1
or	1
cease	1
seeing	1
you;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
won't	1
do	1
this,	1
I	1
will.	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
Papa!"	1
said	1
Sonya	1
resolutely.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
can't	1
live	1
without	1
him!"	1
cried	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
you.	1
And	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
saying!	1
Think	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
of	1
Nicholas."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
anyone,	1
I	1
don't	1
love	1
anyone	1
but	1
him.	1
How	1
dare	1
you	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
dishonorable?	1
Don't	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
him?"	1
screamed	1
Natasha.	1
"Go	1
away,	1
Sonya!	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
quarrel	1
with	1
you,	1
but	1
go,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake	1
go!	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
I	1
am	1
suffering!"	1
Natasha	1
cried	1
angrily,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
repressed	1
irritation.	1
Sonya	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs	1
and	1
ran	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Natasha	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
moment's	1
reflection	1
wrote	1
that	1
answer	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
write	1
all	1
the	1
morning.	1
In	1
this	1
letter	1
she	1
said	1
briefly	1
that	1
all	1
their	1
misunderstandings	1
were	1
at	1
an	1
end;	1
that	1
availing	1
herself	1
of	1
the	1
magnanimity	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
abroad	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
her	1
freedom,	1
she	1
begged	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
forget	1
everything	1
and	1
forgive	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
blame	1
toward	1
her,	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
his	1
wife.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
this	1
all	1
seemed	1
quite	1
easy,	1
simple,	1
and	1
clear	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
On	1
Friday	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
country,	1
but	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
the	1
count	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
prospective	1
purchaser	1
to	1
his	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
count	1
left,	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
invited	1
to	1
a	1
big	1
dinner	1
party	1
at	1
the	1
Karagins',	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
took	1
them	1
there.	1
At	1
that	1
party	1
Natasha	1
again	1
met	1
Anatole,	1
and	1
Sonya	1
noticed	1
that	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
him,	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overheard,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
through	1
dinner	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
agitated	1
than	1
ever.	1
When	1
they	1
got	1
home	1
Natasha	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
explanation	1
Sonya	1
expected.	1
	1
"There,	1
Sonya,	1
you	1
were	1
talking	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
nonsense	1
about	1
him,"	1
Natasha	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
mild	1
voice	1
such	1
as	1
children	1
use	1
when	1
they	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
praised.	1
"We	1
have	1
had	1
an	1
explanation	1
today."	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
happened?	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
say?	1
Natasha,	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
you're	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
me!	1
Tell	1
me	1
everything--the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
say?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
became	1
thoughtful.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Sonya,	1
if	1
you	1
knew	1
him	1
as	1
I	1
do!	1
He	1
said...	1
He	1
asked	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
promised	1
Bolkonski.	1
He	1
was	1
glad	1
I	1
was	1
free	1
to	1
refuse	1
him."	1
	1
Sonya	1
sighed	1
sorrowfully.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
haven't	1
refused	1
Bolkonski?"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
have.	1
Perhaps	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
Bolkonski.	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
badly	1
of	1
me?"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
anything,	1
only	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
this..."	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
Sonya,	1
you'll	1
understand	1
everything.	1
You'll	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
is!	1
Now	1
don't	1
think	1
badly	1
of	1
me	1
or	1
of	1
him.	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
badly	1
of	1
anyone:	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
pity	1
everybody.	1
But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?"	1
	1
Sonya	1
did	1
not	1
succumb	1
to	1
the	1
tender	1
tone	1
Natasha	1
used	1
toward	1
her.	1
The	1
more	1
emotional	1
and	1
ingratiating	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
became,	1
the	1
more	1
serious	1
and	1
stern	1
grew	1
Sonya's.	1
	1
"Natasha,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"you	1
asked	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
haven't	1
spoken,	1
but	1
now	1
you	1
yourself	1
have	1
begun.	1
I	1
don't	1
trust	1
him,	1
Natasha.	1
Why	1
this	1
secrecy?"	1
	1
"Again,	1
again!"	1
interrupted	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
for	1
you!"	1
	1
"Afraid	1
of	1
what?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you're	1
going	1
to	1
your	1
ruin,"	1
said	1
Sonya	1
resolutely,	1
and	1
was	1
herself	1
horrified	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
Anger	1
again	1
showed	1
in	1
Natasha's	1
face.	1
	1
"And	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
ruin,	1
I	1
will,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible!	1
It's	1
not	1
your	1
business!	1
It	1
won't	1
be	1
you,	1
but	1
I,	1
who'll	1
suffer.	1
Leave	1
me	1
alone,	1
leave	1
me	1
alone!	1
I	1
hate	1
you!"	1
	1
"Natasha!"	1
moaned	1
Sonya,	1
aghast.	1
	1
"I	1
hate	1
you,	1
I	1
hate	1
you!	1
You're	1
my	1
enemy	1
forever!"	1
And	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
Sonya	1
again	1
and	1
avoided	1
her.	1
With	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
agitated	1
surprise	1
and	1
guilt	1
she	1
went	1
about	1
the	1
house,	1
taking	1
up	1
now	1
one	1
occupation,	1
now	1
another,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
abandoning	1
them.	1
	1
Hard	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
Sonya,	1
she	1
watched	1
her	1
friend	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
sight.	1
	1
The	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
to	1
return,	1
Sonya	1
noticed	1
that	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
window	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
something	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
drove	1
past,	1
whom	1
Sonya	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
Anatole.	1
	1
Sonya	1
began	1
watching	1
her	1
friend	1
still	1
more	1
attentively	1
and	1
noticed	1
that	1
at	1
dinner	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
evening	1
Natasha	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
unnatural	1
state.	1
She	1
answered	1
questions	1
at	1
random,	1
began	1
sentences	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
finish,	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
everything.	1
	1
After	1
tea	1
Sonya	1
noticed	1
a	1
housemaid	1
at	1
Natasha's	1
door	1
timidly	1
waiting	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
pass.	1
She	1
let	1
the	1
girl	1
go	1
in,	1
and	1
then	1
listening	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
learned	1
that	1
another	1
letter	1
had	1
been	1
delivered.	1
	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
it	1
became	1
clear	1
to	1
Sonya	1
that	1
Natasha	1
had	1
some	1
dreadful	1
plan	1
for	1
that	1
evening.	1
Sonya	1
knocked	1
at	1
her	1
door.	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
in.	1
	1
"She	1
will	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
him!"	1
thought	1
Sonya.	1
"She	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
anything.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
particularly	1
pathetic	1
and	1
resolute	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
today.	1
She	1
cried	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
good-by	1
to	1
Uncle,"	1
Sonya	1
remembered.	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
it,	1
she	1
means	1
to	1
elope	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?"	1
thought	1
she,	1
recalling	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
that	1
clearly	1
indicated	1
that	1
Natasha	1
had	1
some	1
terrible	1
intention.	1
"The	1
count	1
is	1
away.	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?	1
Write	1
to	1
Kuragin	1
demanding	1
an	1
explanation?	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
reply?	1
Write	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
some	1
misfortune?...	1
But	1
perhaps	1
she	1
really	1
has	1
already	1
refused	1
Bolkonski--she	1
sent	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
yesterday.	1
And	1
Uncle	1
is	1
away...."	1
To	1
tell	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
who	1
had	1
such	1
faith	1
in	1
Natasha	1
seemed	1
to	1
Sonya	1
terrible.	1
"Well,	1
anyway,"	1
thought	1
Sonya	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
passage,	1
"now	1
or	1
never	1
I	1
must	1
prove	1
that	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
family's	1
goodness	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
Nicholas.	1
Yes!	1
If	1
I	1
don't	1
sleep	1
for	1
three	1
nights	1
I'll	1
not	1
leave	1
this	1
passage	1
and	1
will	1
hold	1
her	1
back	1
by	1
force	1
and	1
will	1
and	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
family	1
be	1
disgraced,"	1
thought	1
she.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Anatole	1
had	1
lately	1
moved	1
to	1
Dolokhov's.	1
The	1
plan	1
for	1
Natalie	1
Rostova's	1
abduction	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
and	1
the	1
preparations	1
made	1
by	1
Dolokhov	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Sonya,	1
after	1
listening	1
at	1
Natasha's	1
door,	1
resolved	1
to	1
safeguard	1
her,	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
into	1
execution.	1
Natasha	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
Kuragin	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
porch	1
at	1
ten	1
that	1
evening.	1
Kuragin	1
was	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
troyka	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
ready	1
and	1
to	1
drive	1
her	1
forty	1
miles	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Kamenka,	1
where	1
an	1
unfrocked	1
priest	1
was	1
in	1
readiness	1
to	1
perform	1
a	1
marriage	1
ceremony	1
over	1
them.	1
At	1
Kamenka	1
a	1
relay	1
of	1
horses	1
was	1
to	1
wait	1
which	1
would	1
take	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Warsaw	1
highroad,	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
they	1
would	1
hasten	1
abroad	1
with	1
post	1
horses.	1
	1
Anatole	1
had	1
a	1
passport,	1
an	1
order	1
for	1
post	1
horses,	1
ten	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
another	1
ten	1
thousand	1
borrowed	1
with	1
Dolokhov's	1
help.	1
	1
Two	1
witnesses	1
for	1
the	1
mock	1
marriage--Khvostikov,	1
a	1
retired	1
petty	1
official	1
whom	1
Dolokhov	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
in	1
his	1
gambling	1
transactions,	1
and	1
Makarin,	1
a	1
retired	1
hussar,	1
a	1
kindly,	1
weak	1
fellow	1
who	1
had	1
an	1
unbounded	1
affection	1
for	1
Kuragin--were	1
sitting	1
at	1
tea	1
in	1
Dolokhov's	1
front	1
room.	1
	1
In	1
his	1
large	1
study,	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
hung	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling	1
with	1
Persian	1
rugs,	1
bearskins,	1
and	1
weapons,	1
sat	1
Dolokhov	1
in	1
a	1
traveling	1
cloak	1
and	1
high	1
boots,	1
at	1
an	1
open	1
desk	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
an	1
abacus	1
and	1
some	1
bundles	1
of	1
paper	1
money.	1
Anatole,	1
with	1
uniform	1
unbuttoned,	1
walked	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
witnesses	1
were	1
sitting,	1
through	1
the	1
study	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
behind,	1
where	1
his	1
French	1
valet	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
packing	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
his	1
things.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
counting	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
noting	1
something	1
down.	1
	1
"Well,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"Khvostikov	1
must	1
have	1
two	1
thousand."	1
	1
"Give	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
	1
"Makarka"	1
(their	1
name	1
for	1
Makarin)	1
"will	1
go	1
through	1
fire	1
and	1
water	1
for	1
you	1
for	1
nothing.	1
So	1
here	1
are	1
our	1
accounts	1
all	1
settled,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
showing	1
him	1
the	1
memorandum.	1
"Is	1
that	1
right?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
of	1
course,"	1
returned	1
Anatole,	1
evidently	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
banged	1
down	1
the	1
lid	1
of	1
his	1
desk	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Anatole	1
with	1
an	1
ironic	1
smile:	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know?	1
You'd	1
really	1
better	1
drop	1
it	1
all.	1
There's	1
still	1
time!"	1
	1
"Fool,"	1
retorted	1
Anatole.	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
nonsense!	1
If	1
you	1
only	1
knew...	1
it's	1
the	1
devil	1
knows	1
what!"	1
	1
"No,	1
really,	1
give	1
it	1
up!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
"I	1
am	1
speaking	1
seriously.	1
It's	1
no	1
joke,	1
this	1
plot	1
you've	1
hatched."	1
	1
"What,	1
teasing	1
again?	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
devil!	1
Eh?"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
making	1
a	1
grimace.	1
"Really	1
it's	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
your	1
stupid	1
jokes,"	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
condescendingly	1
when	1
Anatole	1
had	1
gone	1
out.	1
	1
"You	1
wait	1
a	1
bit,"	1
he	1
called	1
after	1
him.	1
"I'm	1
not	1
joking,	1
I'm	1
talking	1
sense.	1
Come	1
here,	1
come	1
here!"	1
	1
Anatole	1
returned	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Dolokhov,	1
trying	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
evidently	1
submitting	1
to	1
him	1
involuntarily.	1
	1
"Now	1
listen	1
to	1
me.	1
I'm	1
telling	1
you	1
this	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
joke	1
about	1
it?	1
Did	1
I	1
hinder	1
you?	1
Who	1
arranged	1
everything	1
for	1
you?	1
Who	1
found	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
got	1
the	1
passport?	1
Who	1
raised	1
the	1
money?	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
all."	1
	1
"Well,	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
it.	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
grateful?"	1
And	1
Anatole	1
sighed	1
and	1
embraced	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"I	1
helped	1
you,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
dangerous	1
business,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it--a	1
stupid	1
business.	1
Well,	1
you'll	1
carry	1
her	1
off--all	1
right!	1
Will	1
they	1
let	1
it	1
stop	1
at	1
that?	1
It	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
that	1
you're	1
already	1
married.	1
Why,	1
they'll	1
have	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
criminal	1
court...."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
nonsense,	1
nonsense!"	1
Anatole	1
ejaculated	1
and	1
again	1
made	1
a	1
grimace.	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
explain	1
to	1
you?	1
What?"	1
And	1
Anatole,	1
with	1
the	1
partiality	1
dull-	1
witted	1
people	1
have	1
for	1
any	1
conclusion	1
they	1
have	1
reached	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
reasoning,	1
repeated	1
the	1
argument	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
put	1
to	1
Dolokhov	1
a	1
hundred	1
times.	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
explain	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
conclusion:	1
if	1
this	1
marriage	1
is	1
invalid,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
crooking	1
one	1
finger,	1
"then	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
answer	1
for;	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
valid,	1
no	1
matter!	1
Abroad	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it.	1
Isn't	1
that	1
so?	1
And	1
don't	1
talk	1
to	1
me,	1
don't,	1
don't."	1
	1
"Seriously,	1
you'd	1
better	1
drop	1
it!	1
You'll	1
only	1
get	1
yourself	1
into	1
a	1
mess!"	1
	1
"Go	1
to	1
the	1
devil!"	1
cried	1
Anatole	1
and,	1
clutching	1
his	1
hair,	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
but	1
returned	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
dropped	1
into	1
an	1
armchair	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
turned	1
under	1
him.	1
"It's	1
the	1
very	1
devil!	1
What?	1
Feel	1
how	1
it	1
beats!"	1
He	1
took	1
Dolokhov's	1
hand	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
heart.	1
"What	1
a	1
foot,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!	1
What	1
a	1
glance!	1
A	1
goddess!"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
French.	1
"What?"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
smile	1
and	1
a	1
gleam	1
in	1
his	1
handsome	1
insolent	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
him--evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
more	1
amusement	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Well	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
money's	1
gone,	1
what	1
then?"	1
	1
"What	1
then?	1
Eh?"	1
repeated	1
Anatole,	1
sincerely	1
perplexed	1
by	1
a	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
future.	1
"What	1
then?...	1
Then,	1
I	1
don't	1
know....	1
But	1
why	1
talk	1
nonsense!"	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
"It's	1
time!"	1
	1
Anatole	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
back	1
room.	1
	1
"Now	1
then!	1
Nearly	1
ready?	1
You're	1
dawdling!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
servants.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
money,	1
called	1
a	1
footman	1
whom	1
he	1
ordered	1
to	1
bring	1
something	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
before	1
the	1
journey,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Khvostikov	1
and	1
Makarin	1
were	1
sitting.	1
	1
Anatole	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
and	1
smiling	1
pensively,	1
while	1
his	1
handsome	1
lips	1
muttered	1
tenderly	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
"Come	1
and	1
eat	1
something.	1
Have	1
a	1
drink!"	1
Dolokhov	1
shouted	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
room.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to,"	1
answered	1
Anatole	1
continuing	1
to	1
smile.	1
	1
"Come!	1
Balaga	1
is	1
here."	1
	1
Anatole	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room.	1
Balaga	1
was	1
a	1
famous	1
troyka	1
driver	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
Anatole	1
some	1
six	1
years	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
good	1
service	1
with	1
his	1
troykas.	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
when	1
Anatole's	1
regiment	1
was	1
stationed	1
at	1
Tver	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
from	1
Tver	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Moscow	1
by	1
daybreak,	1
and	1
driven	1
him	1
back	1
again	1
the	1
next	1
night.	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
he	1
had	1
enabled	1
Dolokhov	1
to	1
escape	1
when	1
pursued.	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
town	1
with	1
gypsies	1
and	1
"ladykins"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
cocottes.	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
in	1
their	1
service	1
he	1
had	1
run	1
over	1
pedestrians	1
and	1
upset	1
vehicles	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
protected	1
from	1
the	1
consequences	1
by	1
"my	1
gentlemen"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
them.	1
He	1
had	1
ruined	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
horse	1
in	1
their	1
service.	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
they	1
had	1
beaten	1
him,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
drunk	1
on	1
champagne	1
and	1
Madeira,	1
which	1
he	1
loved;	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
thing	1
about	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
would	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
sent	1
an	1
ordinary	1
man	1
to	1
Siberia.	1
They	1
often	1
called	1
Balaga	1
into	1
their	1
orgies	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
drink	1
and	1
dance	1
at	1
the	1
gypsies',	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
of	1
their	1
money	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
his	1
hands.	1
In	1
their	1
service	1
he	1
risked	1
his	1
skin	1
and	1
his	1
life	1
twenty	1
times	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
service	1
had	1
lost	1
more	1
horses	1
than	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
had	1
from	1
them	1
would	1
buy.	1
But	1
he	1
liked	1
them;	1
liked	1
that	1
mad	1
driving	1
at	1
twelve	1
miles	1
an	1
hour,	1
liked	1
upsetting	1
a	1
driver	1
or	1
running	1
down	1
a	1
pedestrian,	1
and	1
flying	1
at	1
full	1
gallop	1
through	1
the	1
Moscow	1
streets.	1
He	1
liked	1
to	1
hear	1
those	1
wild,	1
tipsy	1
shouts	1
behind	1
him:	1
"Get	1
on!	1
Get	1
on!"	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
go	1
any	1
faster.	1
He	1
liked	1
giving	1
a	1
painful	1
lash	1
on	1
the	1
neck	1
to	1
some	1
peasant	1
who,	1
more	1
dead	1
than	1
alive,	1
was	1
already	1
hurrying	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way.	1
"Real	1
gentlemen!"	1
he	1
considered	1
them.	1
	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
liked	1
Balaga	1
too	1
for	1
his	1
masterly	1
driving	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
liked	1
the	1
things	1
they	1
liked.	1
With	1
others	1
Balaga	1
bargained,	1
charging	1
twenty-five	1
rubles	1
for	1
a	1
two	1
hours'	1
drive,	1
and	1
rarely	1
drove	1
himself,	1
generally	1
letting	1
his	1
young	1
men	1
do	1
so.	1
But	1
with	1
"his	1
gentlemen"	1
he	1
always	1
drove	1
himself	1
and	1
never	1
demanded	1
anything	1
for	1
his	1
work.	1
Only	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
times	1
a	1
year--when	1
he	1
knew	1
from	1
their	1
valets	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
money	1
in	1
hand--he	1
would	1
turn	1
up	1
of	1
a	1
morning	1
quite	1
sober	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
bow	1
would	1
ask	1
them	1
to	1
help	1
him.	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
always	1
made	1
him	1
sit	1
down.	1
	1
"Do	1
help	1
me	1
out,	1
Theodore	1
Ivanych,	1
sir,"	1
or	1
"your	1
excellency,"	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
"I	1
am	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
horses.	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
what	1
you	1
can	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
fair."	1
	1
And	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Dolokhov,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
money,	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
or	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
thousand	1
rubles.	1
	1
Balaga	1
was	1
a	1
fair-haired,	1
short,	1
and	1
snub-nosed	1
peasant	1
of	1
about	1
twenty-	1
seven;	1
red-faced,	1
with	1
a	1
particularly	1
red	1
thick	1
neck,	1
glittering	1
little	1
eyes,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
beard.	1
He	1
wore	1
a	1
fine,	1
dark-blue,	1
silk-lined	1
cloth	1
coat	1
over	1
a	1
sheepskin.	1
	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
room	1
now	1
he	1
crossed	1
himself,	1
turning	1
toward	1
the	1
front	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Dolokhov,	1
holding	1
out	1
a	1
small,	1
black	1
hand.	1
	1
"Theodore	1
Ivanych!"	1
he	1
said,	1
bowing.	1
	1
"How	1
d'you	1
do,	1
friend?	1
Well,	1
here	1
he	1
is!"	1
	1
"Good	1
day,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
he	1
said,	1
again	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
Anatole	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Balaga,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
man's	1
shoulders,	1
"do	1
you	1
care	1
for	1
me	1
or	1
not?	1
Eh?	1
Now,	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
service....	1
What	1
horses	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
with?	1
Eh?"	1
	1
"As	1
your	1
messenger	1
ordered,	1
your	1
special	1
beasts,"	1
replied	1
Balaga.	1
	1
"Well,	1
listen,	1
Balaga!	1
Drive	1
all	1
three	1
to	1
death	1
but	1
get	1
me	1
there	1
in	1
three	1
hours.	1
Eh?"	1
	1
"When	1
they	1
are	1
dead,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
drive?"	1
said	1
Balaga	1
with	1
a	1
wink.	1
	1
"Mind,	1
I'll	1
smash	1
your	1
face	1
in!	1
Don't	1
make	1
jokes!"	1
cried	1
Anatole,	1
suddenly	1
rolling	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Why	1
joke?"	1
said	1
the	1
driver,	1
laughing.	1
"As	1
if	1
I'd	1
grudge	1
my	1
gentlemen	1
anything!	1
As	1
fast	1
as	1
ever	1
the	1
horses	1
can	1
gallop,	1
so	1
fast	1
we'll	1
go!"	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
"Well,	1
sit	1
down."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sit	1
down!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"I'll	1
stand,	1
Theodore	1
Ivanych."	1
	1
"Sit	1
down;	1
nonsense!	1
Have	1
a	1
drink!"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
and	1
filled	1
a	1
large	1
glass	1
of	1
Madeira	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
driver's	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
wine.	1
After	1
refusing	1
it	1
for	1
manners'	1
sake,	1
he	1
drank	1
it	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
mouth	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
silk	1
handkerchief	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"And	1
when	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
start,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
	1
"Well..."	1
Anatole	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
"We'll	1
start	1
at	1
once.	1
Mind,	1
Balaga!	1
You'll	1
get	1
there	1
in	1
time?	1
Eh?"	1
	1
"That	1
depends	1
on	1
our	1
luck	1
in	1
starting,	1
else	1
why	1
shouldn't	1
we	1
be	1
there	1
in	1
time?"	1
replied	1
Balaga.	1
"Didn't	1
we	1
get	1
you	1
to	1
Tver	1
in	1
seven	1
hours?	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
remember	1
that,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
one	1
Christmas	1
I	1
drove	1
from	1
Tver,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
smilingly	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Makarin	1
who	1
gazed	1
rapturously	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes.	1
"Will	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
Makarka,	1
it	1
took	1
one's	1
breath	1
away,	1
the	1
rate	1
we	1
flew.	1
We	1
came	1
across	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
loaded	1
sleighs	1
and	1
drove	1
right	1
over	1
two	1
of	1
them.	1
Eh?"	1
	1
"Those	1
were	1
horses!"	1
Balaga	1
continued	1
the	1
tale.	1
"That	1
time	1
I'd	1
harnessed	1
two	1
young	1
side	1
horses	1
with	1
the	1
bay	1
in	1
the	1
shafts,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
"Will	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
Theodore	1
Ivanych,	1
those	1
animals	1
flew	1
forty	1
miles?	1
I	1
couldn't	1
hold	1
them	1
in,	1
my	1
hands	1
grew	1
numb	1
in	1
the	1
sharp	1
frost	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
reins--'Catch	1
hold	1
yourself,	1
your	1
excellency!'	1
says	1
I,	1
and	1
I	1
just	1
tumbled	1
on	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sleigh	1
and	1
sprawled	1
there.	1
It	1
wasn't	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
urging	1
them	1
on,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
holding	1
them	1
in	1
till	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
place.	1
The	1
devils	1
took	1
us	1
there	1
in	1
three	1
hours!	1
Only	1
the	1
near	1
one	1
died	1
of	1
it."	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Anatole	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
returned	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
wearing	1
a	1
fur	1
coat	1
girt	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
belt,	1
and	1
a	1
sable	1
cap	1
jauntily	1
set	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
very	1
becoming	1
to	1
his	1
handsome	1
face.	1
Having	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
mirror,	1
and	1
standing	1
before	1
Dolokhov	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
pose	1
he	1
had	1
assumed	1
before	1
it,	1
he	1
lifted	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
Theodore.	1
Thank	1
you	1
for	1
everything	1
and	1
farewell!"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
"Well,	1
comrades	1
and	1
friends..."	1
he	1
considered	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
"...of	1
my	1
youth,	1
farewell!"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
Makarin	1
and	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
Though	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
going	1
with	1
him,	1
Anatole	1
evidently	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
something	1
touching	1
and	1
solemn	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
address	1
to	1
his	1
comrades.	1
He	1
spoke	1
slowly	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
and	1
throwing	1
out	1
his	1
chest	1
slightly	1
swayed	1
one	1
leg.	1
	1
"All	1
take	1
glasses;	1
you	1
too,	1
Balaga.	1
Well,	1
comrades	1
and	1
friends	1
of	1
my	1
youth,	1
we've	1
had	1
our	1
fling	1
and	1
lived	1
and	1
reveled.	1
Eh?	1
And	1
now,	1
when	1
shall	1
we	1
meet	1
again?	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
abroad.	1
We	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
time--now	1
farewell,	1
lads!	1
To	1
our	1
health!	1
Hurrah!..."	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
emptying	1
his	1
glass	1
flung	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
"To	1
your	1
health!"	1
said	1
Balaga	1
who	1
also	1
emptied	1
his	1
glass,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
mouth	1
with	1
his	1
handkerchief.	1
	1
Makarin	1
embraced	1
Anatole	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Prince,	1
how	1
sorry	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
you!	1
	1
"Let's	1
go.	1
Let's	1
go!"	1
cried	1
Anatole.	1
	1
Balaga	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"No,	1
stop!"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
"Shut	1
the	1
door;	1
we	1
have	1
first	1
to	1
sit	1
down.	1
That's	1
the	1
way."	1
	1
They	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
all	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
"Now,	1
quick	1
march,	1
lads!"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
rising.	1
	1
Joseph,	1
his	1
valet,	1
handed	1
him	1
his	1
sabretache	1
and	1
saber,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
vestibule.	1
	1
"And	1
where's	1
the	1
fur	1
cloak?"	1
asked	1
Dolokhov.	1
"Hey,	1
Ignatka!	1
Go	1
to	1
Matrena	1
Matrevna	1
and	1
ask	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
sable	1
cloak.	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
elopements	1
are	1
like,"	1
continued	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
a	1
wink.	1
"Why,	1
she'll	1
rush	1
out	1
more	1
dead	1
than	1
alive	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
she	1
is	1
wearing;	1
if	1
you	1
delay	1
at	1
all	1
there'll	1
be	1
tears	1
and	1
'Papa'	1
and	1
'Mamma,'	1
and	1
she's	1
frozen	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
and	1
must	1
go	1
back--but	1
you	1
wrap	1
the	1
fur	1
cloak	1
round	1
her	1
first	1
thing	1
and	1
carry	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
sleigh."	1
	1
The	1
valet	1
brought	1
a	1
woman's	1
fox-lined	1
cloak.	1
	1
"Fool,	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
sable	1
one!	1
Hey,	1
Matrena,	1
the	1
sable!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
voice	1
rang	1
far	1
through	1
the	1
rooms.	1
	1
A	1
handsome,	1
slim,	1
and	1
pale-faced	1
gypsy	1
girl	1
with	1
glittering	1
black	1
eyes	1
and	1
curly	1
blue-black	1
hair,	1
wearing	1
a	1
red	1
shawl,	1
ran	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
sable	1
mantle	1
on	1
her	1
arm.	1
	1
"Here,	1
I	1
don't	1
grudge	1
it--take	1
it!"	1
she	1
said,	1
evidently	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
master	1
and	1
yet	1
regretful	1
of	1
her	1
cloak.	1
	1
Dolokhov,	1
without	1
answering,	1
took	1
the	1
cloak,	1
threw	1
it	1
over	1
Matrena,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
"That's	1
the	1
way,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
"and	1
then	1
so!"	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
collar	1
up	1
round	1
her	1
head,	1
leaving	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
uncovered.	1
"And	1
then	1
so,	1
do	1
you	1
see?"	1
and	1
he	1
pushed	1
Anatole's	1
head	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
gap	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
collar,	1
through	1
which	1
Matrena's	1
brilliant	1
smile	1
was	1
seen.	1
	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
Matrena,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
kissing	1
her.	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
revels	1
here	1
are	1
over.	1
Remember	1
me	1
to	1
Steshka.	1
There,	1
good-by!	1
Good-bye,	1
Matrena,	1
wish	1
me	1
luck!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
Prince,	1
may	1
God	1
give	1
you	1
great	1
luck!"	1
said	1
Matrena	1
in	1
her	1
gypsy	1
accent.	1
	1
Two	1
troykas	1
were	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
two	1
young	1
drivers	1
were	1
holding	1
the	1
horses.	1
Balaga	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
one	1
and	1
holding	1
his	1
elbows	1
high	1
arranged	1
the	1
reins	1
deliberately.	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
got	1
in	1
with	1
him.	1
Makarin,	1
Khvostikov,	1
and	1
a	1
valet	1
seated	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
sleigh.	1
	1
"Well,	1
are	1
you	1
ready?"	1
asked	1
Balaga.	1
	1
"Go!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
twisting	1
the	1
reins	1
round	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
the	1
troyka	1
tore	1
down	1
the	1
Nikitski	1
Boulevard.	1
	1
"Tproo!	1
Get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way!	1
Hi!...	1
Tproo!..."	1
The	1
shouting	1
of	1
Balaga	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sturdy	1
young	1
fellow	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
On	1
the	1
Arbat	1
Square	1
the	1
troyka	1
caught	1
against	1
a	1
carriage;	1
something	1
cracked,	1
shouts	1
were	1
heard,	1
and	1
the	1
troyka	1
flew	1
along	1
the	1
Arbat	1
Street.	1
	1
After	1
taking	1
a	1
turn	1
along	1
the	1
Podnovinski	1
Boulevard,	1
Balaga	1
began	1
to	1
rein	1
in,	1
and	1
turning	1
back	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Konyusheny	1
Street.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
fellow	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
jumped	1
down	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
went	1
along	1
the	1
pavement.	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
gate	1
Dolokhov	1
whistled.	1
The	1
whistle	1
was	1
answered,	1
and	1
a	1
maidservant	1
ran	1
out.	1
	1
"Come	1
into	1
the	1
courtyard	1
or	1
you'll	1
be	1
seen;	1
she'll	1
come	1
out	1
directly,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
stayed	1
by	1
the	1
gate.	1
Anatole	1
followed	1
the	1
maid	1
into	1
the	1
courtyard,	1
turned	1
the	1
corner,	1
and	1
ran	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
Gabriel,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
gigantic	1
footman.	1
	1
"Come	1
to	1
the	1
mistress,	1
please,"	1
said	1
the	1
footman	1
in	1
his	1
deep	1
bass,	1
intercepting	1
any	1
retreat.	1
	1
"To	1
what	1
Mistress?	1
Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
asked	1
Anatole	1
in	1
a	1
breathless	1
whisper.	1
	1
"Kindly	1
step	1
in,	1
my	1
orders	1
are	1
to	1
bring	1
you	1
in."	1
	1
"Kuragin!	1
Come	1
back!"	1
shouted	1
Dolokhov.	1
"Betrayed!	1
Back!"	1
	1
Dolokhov,	1
after	1
Anatole	1
entered,	1
had	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
wicket	1
gate	1
and	1
was	1
struggling	1
with	1
the	1
yard	1
porter	1
who	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
lock	1
it.	1
With	1
a	1
last	1
desperate	1
effort	1
Dolokhov	1
pushed	1
the	1
porter	1
aside,	1
and	1
when	1
Anatole	1
ran	1
back	1
seized	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
pulled	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
wicket,	1
and	1
ran	1
back	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
troyka.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
having	1
found	1
Sonya	1
weeping	1
in	1
the	1
corridor,	1
made	1
her	1
confess	1
everything,	1
and	1
intercepting	1
the	1
note	1
to	1
Natasha	1
she	1
read	1
it	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
Natasha's	1
room	1
with	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"You	1
shameless	1
good-for-nothing!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
won't	1
hear	1
a	1
word."	1
	1
Pushing	1
back	1
Natasha	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
astonished	1
but	1
tearless	1
eyes,	1
she	1
locked	1
her	1
in;	1
and	1
having	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
yard	1
porter	1
to	1
admit	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
coming	1
that	1
evening,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
out	1
again,	1
and	1
having	1
told	1
the	1
footman	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
she	1
seated	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
await	1
the	1
abductors.	1
	1
When	1
Gabriel	1
came	1
to	1
inform	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
had	1
run	1
away	1
again,	1
she	1
rose	1
frowning,	1
and	1
clasping	1
her	1
hands	1
behind	1
her	1
paced	1
through	1
the	1
rooms	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
considering	1
what	1
she	1
should	1
do.	1
Toward	1
midnight	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
room	1
fingering	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
her	1
pocket.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
sitting	1
sobbing	1
in	1
the	1
corridor.	1
"Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake	1
let	1
me	1
in	1
to	1
her!"	1
she	1
pleaded,	1
but	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
unlocked	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
without	1
giving	1
her	1
an	1
answer....	1
"Disgusting,	1
abominable...	1
In	1
my	1
house...	1
horrid	1
girl,	1
hussy!	1
I'm	1
only	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
father!"	1
thought	1
she,	1
trying	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
wrath.	1
"Hard	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
tongues	1
and	1
will	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
count."	1
She	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
resolute	1
steps.	1
Natasha	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
her	1
head	1
hidden	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
stir.	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
had	1
left	1
her.	1
	1
"A	1
nice	1
girl!	1
Very	1
nice!"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
"Arranging	1
meetings	1
with	1
lovers	1
in	1
my	1
house!	1
It's	1
no	1
use	1
pretending:	1
you	1
listen	1
when	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
you!"	1
And	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
touched	1
her	1
arm.	1
"Listen	1
when	1
I	1
speak!	1
You've	1
disgraced	1
yourself	1
like	1
the	1
lowest	1
of	1
hussies.	1
I'd	1
treat	1
you	1
differently,	1
but	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
for	1
your	1
father,	1
so	1
I	1
will	1
conceal	1
it."	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
her	1
position,	1
but	1
her	1
whole	1
body	1
heaved	1
with	1
noiseless,	1
convulsive	1
sobs	1
which	1
choked	1
her.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
Sonya	1
and	1
seated	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
beside	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"It's	1
lucky	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
escaped	1
me;	1
but	1
I'll	1
find	1
him!"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
rough	1
voice.	1
"Do	1
you	1
hear	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
saying	1
or	1
not?"	1
she	1
added.	1
	1
She	1
put	1
her	1
large	1
hand	1
under	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
toward	1
her.	1
Both	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
and	1
Sonya	1
were	1
amazed	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
how	1
Natasha	1
looked.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
dry	1
and	1
glistening,	1
her	1
lips	1
compressed,	1
her	1
cheeks	1
sunken.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
be!...	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
me?...	1
I	1
shall	1
die!"	1
she	1
muttered,	1
wrenching	1
herself	1
from	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
vicious	1
effort	1
and	1
sinking	1
down	1
again	1
into	1
her	1
former	1
position.	1
	1
"Natalie!"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
"I	1
wish	1
for	1
your	1
good.	1
Lie	1
still,	1
stay	1
like	1
that	1
then,	1
I	1
won't	1
touch	1
you.	1
But	1
listen.	1
I	1
won't	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
guilty	1
you	1
are.	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
yourself.	1
But	1
when	1
your	1
father	1
comes	1
back	1
tomorrow	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
tell	1
him?	1
Eh?"	1
	1
Again	1
Natasha's	1
body	1
shook	1
with	1
sobs.	1
	1
"Suppose	1
he	1
finds	1
out,	1
and	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
your	1
betrothed?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
betrothed:	1
I	1
have	1
refused	1
him!"	1
cried	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"That's	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
continued	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
"If	1
they	1
hear	1
of	1
this,	1
will	1
they	1
let	1
it	1
pass?	1
He,	1
your	1
father,	1
I	1
know	1
him...	1
if	1
he	1
challenges	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
duel	1
will	1
that	1
be	1
all	1
right?	1
Eh?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
let	1
me	1
be!	1
Why	1
have	1
you	1
interfered	1
at	1
all?	1
Why?	1
Why?	1
Who	1
asked	1
you	1
to?"	1
shouted	1
Natasha,	1
raising	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
looking	1
malignantly	1
at	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
want?"	1
cried	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
growing	1
angry	1
again.	1
"Were	1
you	1
kept	1
under	1
lock	1
and	1
key?	1
Who	1
hindered	1
his	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
house?	1
Why	1
carry	1
you	1
off	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
some	1
gypsy	1
singing	1
girl?...	1
Well,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
you	1
off...	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
they	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
found	1
him?	1
Your	1
father,	1
or	1
brother,	1
or	1
your	1
betrothed?	1
And	1
he's	1
a	1
scoundrel,	1
a	1
wretch--	1
that's	1
a	1
fact!"	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
you!"	1
exclaimed	1
Natasha	1
getting	1
up.	1
"If	1
you	1
hadn't	1
interfered...	1
Oh,	1
my	1
God!	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
all?	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
Sonya,	1
why?...	1
Go	1
away!"	1
	1
And	1
she	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs	1
with	1
the	1
despairing	1
vehemence	1
with	1
which	1
people	1
bewail	1
disasters	1
they	1
feel	1
they	1
have	1
themselves	1
occasioned.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
was	1
to	1
speak	1
again	1
but	1
Natasha	1
cried	1
out:	1
	1
"Go	1
away!	1
Go	1
away!	1
You	1
all	1
hate	1
and	1
despise	1
me!"	1
and	1
she	1
threw	1
herself	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
went	1
on	1
admonishing	1
her	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
enjoining	1
on	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
all	1
be	1
kept	1
from	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
assuring	1
her	1
that	1
nobody	1
would	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it	1
if	1
only	1
Natasha	1
herself	1
would	1
undertake	1
to	1
forget	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
not	1
let	1
anyone	1
see	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened.	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
nor	1
did	1
she	1
sob	1
any	1
longer,	1
but	1
she	1
grew	1
cold	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
shivering	1
fit.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
put	1
a	1
pillow	1
under	1
her	1
head,	1
covered	1
her	1
with	1
two	1
quilts,	1
and	1
herself	1
brought	1
her	1
some	1
lime-flower	1
water,	1
but	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
respond	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Well,	1
let	1
her	1
sleep,"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
supposing	1
Natasha	1
to	1
be	1
asleep.	1
	1
But	1
Natasha	1
was	1
not	1
asleep;	1
with	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
fixed	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
she	1
looked	1
straight	1
before	1
her.	1
All	1
that	1
night	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
or	1
weep	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
Sonya	1
who	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
several	1
times.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
returned	1
from	1
his	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
lunch	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
promised.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
spirits;	1
the	1
affair	1
with	1
the	1
purchaser	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
satisfactorily,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
any	1
longer	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
countess	1
whom	1
he	1
missed.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
met	1
him	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
Natasha	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
unwell	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
doctor,	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
better	1
now.	1
Natasha	1
had	1
not	1
left	1
her	1
room	1
that	1
morning.	1
With	1
compressed	1
and	1
parched	1
lips	1
and	1
dry	1
fixed	1
eyes,	1
she	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
uneasily	1
watching	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
drove	1
past	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
glancing	1
round	1
at	1
anyone	1
who	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
was	1
evidently	1
expecting	1
news	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
or	1
would	1
write	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
count	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
she	1
turned	1
anxiously	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
footstep,	1
and	1
then	1
her	1
face	1
resumed	1
its	1
cold	1
and	1
malevolent	1
expression.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
get	1
up	1
to	1
greet	1
him.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
angel?	1
Are	1
you	1
ill?"	1
asked	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
moment's	1
silence	1
Natasha	1
answered:	1
"Yes,	1
ill."	1
	1
In	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
anxious	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
why	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
dejected	1
and	1
whether	1
anything	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
her	1
betrothed,	1
she	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
worry.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
confirmed	1
Natasha's	1
assurances	1
that	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened.	1
From	1
the	1
pretense	1
of	1
illness,	1
from	1
his	1
daughter's	1
distress,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
embarrassed	1
faces	1
of	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
the	1
count	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
gone	1
wrong	1
during	1
his	1
absence,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
terrible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
anything	1
disgraceful	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
his	1
beloved	1
daughter,	1
and	1
he	1
so	1
prized	1
his	1
own	1
cheerful	1
tranquillity,	1
that	1
he	1
avoided	1
inquiries	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
assure	1
himself	1
that	1
nothing	1
particularly	1
had	1
happened;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
dissatisfied	1
that	1
her	1
indisposition	1
delayed	1
their	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
country.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
From	1
the	1
day	1
his	1
wife	1
arrived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
intending	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
somewhere,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
near	1
her.	1
Soon	1
after	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow	1
the	1
effect	1
Natasha	1
had	1
on	1
him	1
made	1
him	1
hasten	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
intention.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
Tver	1
to	1
see	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
widow,	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
promised	1
to	1
hand	1
over	1
to	1
him	1
some	1
papers	1
of	1
her	1
deceased	1
husband's.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow	1
Pierre	1
was	1
handed	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
relating	1
to	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski	1
and	1
his	1
betrothed.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
avoiding	1
Natasha	1
because	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
a	1
married	1
man's	1
should	1
be	1
for	1
his	1
friend's	1
fiancee.	1
Yet	1
some	1
fate	1
constantly	1
threw	1
them	1
together.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
have	1
happened?	1
And	1
what	1
can	1
they	1
want	1
with	1
me?"	1
thought	1
he	1
as	1
he	1
dressed	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's.	1
"If	1
only	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
would	1
hurry	1
up	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
marry	1
her!"	1
thought	1
he	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
Tverskoy	1
Boulevard	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
called	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Pierre!	1
Been	1
back	1
long?"	1
someone	1
shouted.	1
Pierre	1
raised	1
his	1
head.	1
In	1
a	1
sleigh	1
drawn	1
by	1
two	1
gray	1
trotting-horses	1
that	1
were	1
bespattering	1
the	1
dashboard	1
with	1
snow,	1
Anatole	1
and	1
his	1
constant	1
companion	1
Makarin	1
dashed	1
past.	1
Anatole	1
was	1
sitting	1
upright	1
in	1
the	1
classic	1
pose	1
of	1
military	1
dandies,	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
hidden	1
by	1
his	1
beaver	1
collar	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
slightly	1
bent.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
fresh	1
and	1
rosy,	1
his	1
white-plumed	1
hat,	1
tilted	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
disclosed	1
his	1
curled	1
and	1
pomaded	1
hair	1
besprinkled	1
with	1
powdery	1
snow.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,	1
that's	1
a	1
true	1
sage,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"He	1
sees	1
nothing	1
beyond	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
nothing	1
troubles	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
cheerful,	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
serene.	1
What	1
wouldn't	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
him!"	1
he	1
thought	1
enviously.	1
	1
In	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
anteroom	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
helped	1
him	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
mistress	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
bedroom.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
ballroom	1
door	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
Natasha	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
with	1
a	1
thin,	1
pale,	1
and	1
spiteful	1
face.	1
She	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
him,	1
frowned,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
cold	1
dignity.	1
	1
"What	1
has	1
happened?"	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
entering	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
room.	1
	1
"Fine	1
doings!"	1
answered	1
Dmitrievna.	1
"For	1
fifty-eight	1
years	1
have	1
I	1
lived	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
never	1
known	1
anything	1
so	1
disgraceful!"	1
	1
And	1
having	1
put	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
honor	1
not	1
to	1
repeat	1
anything	1
she	1
told	1
him,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
Natasha	1
had	1
refused	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
without	1
her	1
parents'	1
knowledge	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
was	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
into	1
whose	1
society	1
Pierre's	1
wife	1
had	1
thrown	1
her	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
Natasha	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
elope	1
during	1
her	1
father's	1
absence,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
secretly.	1
	1
Pierre	1
raised	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
listened	1
open-mouthed	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
told	1
him,	1
scarcely	1
able	1
to	1
believe	1
his	1
own	1
ears.	1
That	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
deeply	1
loved	1
affianced	1
wife--the	1
same	1
Natasha	1
Rostova	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
charming--should	1
give	1
up	1
Bolkonski	1
for	1
that	1
fool	1
Anatole	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
secretly	1
married	1
(as	1
Pierre	1
knew),	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
him,	1
was	1
something	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
imagine.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
reconcile	1
the	1
charming	1
impression	1
he	1
had	1
of	1
Natasha,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
from	1
a	1
child,	1
with	1
this	1
new	1
conception	1
of	1
her	1
baseness,	1
folly,	1
and	1
cruelty.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
wife.	1
"They	1
are	1
all	1
alike!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
reflecting	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
unfortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
tied	1
to	1
a	1
bad	1
woman.	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
pitied	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
his	1
wounded	1
pride,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
pitied	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
more	1
did	1
he	1
think	1
with	1
contempt	1
and	1
even	1
with	1
disgust	1
of	1
that	1
Natasha	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
passed	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
cold	1
dignity.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
Natasha's	1
soul	1
was	1
overflowing	1
with	1
despair,	1
shame,	1
and	1
humiliation,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
fault	1
that	1
her	1
face	1
happened	1
to	1
assume	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
calm	1
dignity	1
and	1
severity.	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
get	1
married?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
"He	1
could	1
not	1
marry--he	1
is	1
married!"	1
	1
"Things	1
get	1
worse	1
from	1
hour	1
to	1
hour!"	1
ejaculated	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
"A	1
nice	1
youth!	1
What	1
a	1
scoundrel!	1
And	1
she's	1
expecting	1
him--expecting	1
him	1
since	1
yesterday.	1
She	1
must	1
be	1
told!	1
Then	1
at	1
least	1
she	1
won't	1
go	1
on	1
expecting	1
him."	1
	1
After	1
hearing	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
Anatole's	1
marriage	1
from	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
giving	1
vent	1
to	1
her	1
anger	1
against	1
Anatole	1
in	1
words	1
of	1
abuse,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
told	1
Pierre	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
him.	1
She	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
or	1
Bolkonski,	1
who	1
might	1
arrive	1
at	1
any	1
moment,	1
if	1
they	1
knew	1
of	1
this	1
affair	1
(which	1
she	1
hoped	1
to	1
hide	1
from	1
them)	1
might	1
challenge	1
Anatole	1
to	1
a	1
duel,	1
and	1
she	1
therefore	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
brother-in-law	1
in	1
her	1
name	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
and	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
set	1
eyes	1
on	1
him	1
again.	1
Pierre--only	1
now	1
realizing	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew--	1
promised	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
she	1
wished.	1
Having	1
briefly	1
and	1
exactly	1
explained	1
her	1
wishes	1
to	1
him,	1
she	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"Mind,	1
the	1
count	1
knows	1
nothing.	1
Behave	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
know	1
nothing	1
either,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"And	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
expecting	1
him!	1
And	1
stay	1
to	1
dinner	1
if	1
you	1
care	1
to!"	1
she	1
called	1
after	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Pierre	1
met	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
who	1
seemed	1
nervous	1
and	1
upset.	1
That	1
morning	1
Natasha	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
rejected	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"Troubles,	1
troubles,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"What	1
troubles	1
one	1
has	1
with	1
these	1
girls	1
without	1
their	1
mother!	1
I	1
do	1
so	1
regret	1
having	1
come	1
here....	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
frank	1
with	1
you.	1
Have	1
you	1
heard	1
she	1
has	1
broken	1
off	1
her	1
engagement	1
without	1
consulting	1
anybody?	1
It's	1
true	1
this	1
engagement	1
never	1
was	1
much	1
to	1
my	1
liking.	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
man,	1
but	1
still,	1
with	1
his	1
father's	1
disapproval	1
they	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
been	1
happy,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
won't	1
lack	1
suitors.	1
Still,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
so	1
long,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
such	1
a	1
step	1
without	1
father's	1
or	1
mother's	1
consent!	1
And	1
now	1
she's	1
ill,	1
and	1
God	1
knows	1
what!	1
It's	1
hard,	1
Count,	1
hard	1
to	1
manage	1
daughters	1
in	1
their	1
mother's	1
absence...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
much	1
upset	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject,	1
but	1
the	1
count	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
troubles.	1
	1
Sonya	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
an	1
agitated	1
face.	1
	1
"Natasha	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
well;	1
she's	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
you.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
is	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
too	1
asks	1
you	1
to	1
come."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
Bolkonski's,	1
no	1
doubt	1
she	1
wants	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
a	1
message,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"Oh	1
dear!	1
Oh	1
dear!	1
How	1
happy	1
it	1
all	1
was!"	1
	1
And	1
clutching	1
the	1
spare	1
gray	1
locks	1
on	1
his	1
temples	1
the	1
count	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
When	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
told	1
Natasha	1
that	1
Anatole	1
was	1
married,	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
having	1
it	1
confirmed	1
by	1
Pierre	1
himself.	1
Sonya	1
told	1
Pierre	1
this	1
as	1
she	1
led	1
him	1
along	1
the	1
corridor	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
room.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
pale	1
and	1
stern,	1
was	1
sitting	1
beside	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes,	1
glittering	1
feverishly,	1
met	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
questioning	1
look	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
entered.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
smile	1
or	1
nod,	1
but	1
only	1
gazed	1
fixedly	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
look	1
asked	1
only	1
one	1
thing:	1
was	1
he	1
a	1
friend,	1
or	1
like	1
the	1
others	1
an	1
enemy	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
Anatole?	1
As	1
for	1
Pierre,	1
he	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
exist	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"He	1
knows	1
all	1
about	1
it,"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
pointing	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
addressing	1
Natasha.	1
"Let	1
him	1
tell	1
you	1
whether	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
the	1
truth."	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
a	1
hunted	1
and	1
wounded	1
animal	1
looks	1
at	1
the	1
approaching	1
dogs	1
and	1
sportsmen.	1
	1
"Natalya	1
Ilynichna,"	1
Pierre	1
began,	1
dropping	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
loathing	1
for	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do,	1
"whether	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
or	1
not	1
should	1
make	1
no	1
difference	1
to	1
you,	1
because..."	1
	1
"Then	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
true	1
that	1
he's	1
married!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
true."	1
	1
"Has	1
he	1
been	1
married	1
long?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"On	1
your	1
honor?..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
his	1
word	1
of	1
honor.	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
still	1
here?"	1
she	1
asked,	1
quickly.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
seen	1
him."	1
	1
She	1
was	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
leave	1
her	1
alone.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
for	1
dinner,	1
but	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
at	1
once.	1
He	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
town	1
seeking	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin,	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
whom	1
now	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
difficulty	1
in	1
breathing.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
ice	1
hills,	1
nor	1
at	1
the	1
gypsies',	1
nor	1
at	1
Komoneno's.	1
Pierre	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
club.	1
In	1
the	1
club	1
all	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
as	1
usual.	1
The	1
members	1
who	1
were	1
assembling	1
for	1
dinner	1
were	1
sitting	1
about	1
in	1
groups;	1
they	1
greeted	1
Pierre	1
and	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
news.	1
The	1
footman	1
having	1
greeted	1
him,	1
knowing	1
his	1
habits	1
and	1
his	1
acquaintances,	1
told	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
left	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
dining	1
room	1
and	1
that	1
Prince	1
Michael	1
Zakharych	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
library,	1
but	1
Paul	1
Timofeevich	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
arrived.	1
One	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
acquaintances,	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
weather,	1
asked	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
Kuragin's	1
abduction	1
of	1
Rostova	1
which	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
was	1
it	1
true?	1
Pierre	1
laughed	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
nonsense	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
Rostovs'.	1
He	1
asked	1
everyone	1
about	1
Anatole.	1
One	1
man	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
yet,	1
and	1
another	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
dinner.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
it	1
strange	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
calm,	1
indifferent	1
crowd	1
of	1
people	1
unaware	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
paced	1
through	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
waited	1
till	1
everyone	1
had	1
come,	1
and	1
as	1
Anatole	1
had	1
not	1
turned	1
up	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
for	1
dinner	1
but	1
drove	1
home.	1
	1
Anatole,	1
for	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
was	1
looking,	1
dined	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
Dolokhov,	1
consulting	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
to	1
remedy	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
affair.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
essential	1
to	1
see	1
Natasha.	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
drove	1
to	1
his	1
sister's	1
to	1
discuss	1
with	1
her	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
meeting.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
returned	1
home	1
after	1
vainly	1
hunting	1
all	1
over	1
Moscow,	1
his	1
valet	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
Prince	1
Anatole	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
countess.	1
The	1
countess'	1
drawing	1
room	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
guests.	1
	1
Pierre	1
without	1
greeting	1
his	1
wife	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
since	1
his	1
return--	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
repulsive	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
ever--entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
seeing	1
Anatole	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Pierre,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
"You	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
a	1
plight	1
our	1
Anatole..."	1
	1
She	1
stopped,	1
seeing	1
in	1
the	1
forward	1
thrust	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
head,	1
in	1
his	1
glowing	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
resolute	1
gait,	1
the	1
terrible	1
indications	1
of	1
that	1
rage	1
and	1
strength	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
and	1
had	1
herself	1
experienced	1
after	1
his	1
duel	1
with	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Where	1
you	1
are,	1
there	1
is	1
vice	1
and	1
evil!"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
"Anatole,	1
come	1
with	1
me!	1
I	1
must	1
speak	1
to	1
you,"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
Anatole	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
rose	1
submissively,	1
ready	1
to	1
follow	1
Pierre.	1
Pierre,	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
pulled	1
him	1
toward	1
himself	1
and	1
was	1
leading	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
allow	1
yourself	1
in	1
my	1
drawing	1
room..."	1
whispered	1
Helene,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Anatole	1
followed	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
jaunty	1
step	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
betrayed	1
anxiety.	1
	1
Having	1
entered	1
his	1
study	1
Pierre	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
addressed	1
Anatole	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
promised	1
Countess	1
Rostova	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
elope	1
with	1
her,	1
is	1
that	1
so?"	1
	1
"Mon	1
cher,"	1
answered	1
Anatole	1
(their	1
whole	1
conversation	1
was	1
in	1
French),	1
"I	1
don't	1
consider	1
myself	1
bound	1
to	1
answer	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
that	1
tone."	1
	1
Pierre's	1
face,	1
already	1
pale,	1
became	1
distorted	1
by	1
fury.	1
He	1
seized	1
Anatole	1
by	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
uniform	1
with	1
his	1
big	1
hand	1
and	1
shook	1
him	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
till	1
Anatole's	1
face	1
showed	1
a	1
sufficient	1
degree	1
of	1
terror.	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
you!..."	1
repeated	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Come	1
now,	1
this	1
is	1
stupid.	1
What?"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
fingering	1
a	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
collar	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
wrenched	1
loose	1
with	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
the	1
cloth.	1
	1
"You're	1
a	1
scoundrel	1
and	1
a	1
blackguard,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
deprives	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
smashing	1
your	1
head	1
with	1
this!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
expressing	1
himself	1
so	1
artificially	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
French.	1
	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
heavy	1
paperweight	1
and	1
lifted	1
it	1
threateningly,	1
but	1
at	1
once	1
put	1
it	1
back	1
in	1
its	1
place.	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
promise	1
to	1
marry	1
her?"	1
	1
"I...	1
I	1
didn't	1
think	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
never	1
promised,	1
because..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
any	1
letters	1
of	1
hers?	1
Any	1
letters?"	1
he	1
said,	1
moving	1
toward	1
Anatole.	1
	1
Anatole	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
immediately	1
thrust	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
pocketbook.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
Anatole	1
handed	1
him	1
and,	1
pushing	1
aside	1
a	1
table	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
his	1
way,	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"I	1
shan't	1
be	1
violent,	1
don't	1
be	1
afraid!"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
frightened	1
gesture	1
of	1
Anatole's.	1
"First,	1
the	1
letters,"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
if	1
repeating	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Secondly,"	1
he	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
again	1
rising	1
and	1
again	1
pacing	1
the	1
room,	1
"tomorrow	1
you	1
must	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
can	1
I?..."	1
	1
"Thirdly,"	1
Pierre	1
continued	1
without	1
listening	1
to	1
him,	1
"you	1
must	1
never	1
breathe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
passed	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
Countess	1
Rostova.	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
can't	1
prevent	1
your	1
doing	1
so,	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
spark	1
of	1
conscience..."	1
Pierre	1
paced	1
the	1
room	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
Anatole	1
sat	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
frowning	1
and	1
biting	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
"After	1
all,	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
besides	1
your	1
pleasure	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
other	1
people's	1
happiness	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
ruining	1
a	1
whole	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
amusing	1
yourself!	1
Amuse	1
yourself	1
with	1
women	1
like	1
my	1
wife--with	1
them	1
you	1
are	1
within	1
your	1
rights,	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
them.	1
They	1
are	1
armed	1
against	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
experience	1
of	1
debauchery;	1
but	1
to	1
promise	1
a	1
maid	1
to	1
marry	1
her...	1
to	1
deceive,	1
to	1
kidnap....	1
Don't	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
mean	1
as	1
beating	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
child?..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
paused	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Anatole	1
no	1
longer	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
questioning	1
look.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
about	1
that,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
growing	1
more	1
confident	1
as	1
Pierre	1
mastered	1
his	1
wrath.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
that	1
and	1
don't	1
want	1
to,"	1
he	1
said,	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
tremor	1
of	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw,	1
"but	1
you	1
have	1
used	1
such	1
words	1
to	1
me--'mean'	1
and	1
so	1
on--which	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
honor	1
I	1
can't	1
allow	1
anyone	1
to	1
use."	1
	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
amazement,	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
	1
"Though	1
it	1
was	1
tête-à-tête,"	1
Anatole	1
continued,	1
"still	1
I	1
can't..."	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
satisfaction	1
you	1
want?"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
ironically.	1
	1
"You	1
could	1
at	1
least	1
take	1
back	1
your	1
words.	1
What?	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
wish,	1
eh?"	1
	1
"I	1
take	1
them	1
back,	1
I	1
take	1
them	1
back!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
"and	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
forgive	1
me."	1
Pierre	1
involuntarily	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
loose	1
button.	1
"And	1
if	1
you	1
require	1
money	1
for	1
your	1
journey..."	1
	1
Anatole	1
smiled.	1
The	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
base	1
and	1
cringing	1
smile,	1
which	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
his	1
wife,	1
revolted	1
him.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
vile	1
and	1
heartless	1
brood!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Anatole	1
left	1
for	1
Petersburg.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
Pierre	1
drove	1
to	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
her	1
wish	1
that	1
Kuragin	1
should	1
be	1
banished	1
from	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
whole	1
house	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
alarm	1
and	1
commotion.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
very	1
ill,	1
having,	1
as	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
told	1
him	1
in	1
secret,	1
poisoned	1
herself	1
the	1
night	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
Anatole	1
was	1
married,	1
with	1
some	1
arsenic	1
she	1
had	1
stealthily	1
procured.	1
After	1
swallowing	1
a	1
little	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
she	1
woke	1
Sonya	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done.	1
The	1
necessary	1
antidotes	1
had	1
been	1
administered	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
danger,	1
though	1
still	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
move	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
countess	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
for.	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
the	1
distracted	1
count,	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
tear-stained	1
face,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Pierre	1
dined	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
gossip	1
about	1
the	1
attempted	1
abduction	1
of	1
Rostova.	1
He	1
resolutely	1
denied	1
these	1
rumors,	1
assuring	1
everyone	1
that	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened	1
except	1
that	1
his	1
brother-in-	1
law	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
been	1
refused.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
conceal	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
and	1
re-establish	1
Natasha's	1
reputation.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
awaiting	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
return	1
with	1
dread	1
and	1
went	1
every	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
for	1
news	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
Old	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
rumors	1
current	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
from	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
note	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
which	1
Natasha	1
had	1
broken	1
off	1
her	1
engagement.	1
He	1
seemed	1
in	1
better	1
spirits	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
awaited	1
his	1
son	1
with	1
great	1
impatience.	1
	1
Some	1
days	1
after	1
Anatole's	1
departure	1
Pierre	1
received	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
informing	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
and	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
reached	1
Moscow,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
Natasha's	1
note	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
breaking	1
off	1
her	1
engagement	1
(Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
had	1
purloined	1
it	1
from	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince),	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
elopement,	1
with	1
additions.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
Pierre	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
next	1
morning.	1
Pierre	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
as	1
Natasha	1
and	1
was	1
therefore	1
surprised	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
talking	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
animated	1
voice	1
about	1
some	1
intrigue	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
The	1
old	1
prince's	1
voice	1
and	1
another	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
Pierre.	1
She	1
sighed,	1
looking	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was,	1
evidently	1
intending	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
sympathy	1
with	1
his	1
sorrow,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
by	1
her	1
face	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
both	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
her	1
brother	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
faithlessness.	1
	1
"He	1
says	1
he	1
expected	1
it,"	1
she	1
remarked.	1
"I	1
know	1
his	1
pride	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
express	1
his	1
feelings,	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
has	1
taken	1
it	1
better,	1
far	1
better,	1
than	1
I	1
expected.	1
Evidently	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be...."	1
	1
"But	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
really	1
ended?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
astonishment.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
ask	1
such	1
a	1
question.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
study.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
greatly	1
changed	1
and	1
plainly	1
in	1
better	1
health,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
fresh	1
horizontal	1
wrinkle	1
between	1
his	1
brows,	1
stood	1
in	1
civilian	1
dress	1
facing	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
Prince	1
Meshcherski,	1
warmly	1
disputing	1
and	1
vigorously	1
gesticulating.	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
about	1
Speranski--the	1
news	1
of	1
whose	1
sudden	1
exile	1
and	1
alleged	1
treachery	1
had	1
just	1
reached	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"Now	1
he	1
is	1
censured	1
and	1
accused	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
enthusiastic	1
about	1
him	1
a	1
month	1
ago,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
saying,	1
"and	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
his	1
aims.	1
To	1
judge	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
disfavor	1
and	1
to	1
throw	1
on	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
blame	1
of	1
other	1
men's	1
mistakes	1
is	1
very	1
easy,	1
but	1
I	1
maintain	1
that	1
if	1
anything	1
good	1
has	1
been	1
accomplished	1
in	1
this	1
reign	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
him,	1
by	1
him	1
alone."	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pierre.	1
His	1
face	1
quivered	1
and	1
immediately	1
assumed	1
a	1
vindictive	1
expression.	1
	1
"Posterity	1
will	1
do	1
him	1
justice,"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
are	1
you?	1
Still	1
getting	1
stouter?"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
animation,	1
but	1
the	1
new	1
wrinkle	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
deepened.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
well,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
question,	1
and	1
smiled.	1
	1
To	1
Pierre	1
that	1
smile	1
said	1
plainly:	1
"I	1
am	1
well,	1
but	1
my	1
health	1
is	1
now	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
anyone."	1
	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
Pierre	1
about	1
the	1
awful	1
roads	1
from	1
the	1
Polish	1
frontier,	1
about	1
people	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
Switzerland	1
who	1
knew	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
about	1
M.	1
Dessalles,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
abroad	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
son's	1
tutor,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again	1
joined	1
warmly	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
about	1
Speranski	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
going	1
on	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
old	1
men.	1
	1
"If	1
there	1
were	1
treason,	1
or	1
proofs	1
of	1
secret	1
relations	1
with	1
Napoleon,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
public,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
warmth	1
and	1
haste.	1
"I	1
do	1
not,	1
and	1
never	1
did,	1
like	1
Speranski	1
personally,	1
but	1
I	1
like	1
justice!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
now	1
recognized	1
in	1
his	1
friend	1
a	1
need	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
too	1
familiar,	1
to	1
get	1
excited	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
arguments	1
about	1
extraneous	1
matters	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
stifle	1
thoughts	1
that	1
were	1
too	1
oppressive	1
and	1
too	1
intimate.	1
When	1
Prince	1
Meshcherski	1
had	1
left,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
took	1
Pierre's	1
arm	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
assigned	1
him.	1
A	1
bed	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
up	1
there,	1
and	1
some	1
open	1
portmanteaus	1
and	1
trunks	1
stood	1
about.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
to	1
one	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
casket,	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
drew	1
a	1
packet	1
wrapped	1
in	1
paper.	1
He	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
silently	1
and	1
very	1
quickly.	1
He	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
coughed.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
gloomy	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
compressed.	1
	1
"Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
troubling	1
you..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
his	1
broad	1
face	1
expressed	1
pity	1
and	1
sympathy.	1
This	1
expression	1
irritated	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
determined,	1
ringing,	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
tone	1
he	1
continued:	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
refusal	1
from	1
Countess	1
Rostova	1
and	1
have	1
heard	1
reports	1
of	1
your	1
brother-in-law	1
having	1
sought	1
her	1
hand,	1
or	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
kind.	1
Is	1
that	1
true?"	1
	1
"Both	1
true	1
and	1
untrue,"	1
Pierre	1
began;	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Here	1
are	1
her	1
letters	1
and	1
her	1
portrait,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
packet	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Give	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
countess...	1
if	1
you	1
see	1
her."	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
very	1
ill,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Then	1
she	1
is	1
here	1
still?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"And	1
Prince	1
Kuragin?"	1
he	1
added	1
quickly.	1
	1
"He	1
left	1
long	1
ago.	1
She	1
has	1
been	1
at	1
death's	1
door."	1
	1
"I	1
much	1
regret	1
her	1
illness,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew;	1
and	1
he	1
smiled	1
like	1
his	1
father,	1
coldly,	1
maliciously,	1
and	1
unpleasantly.	1
	1
"So	1
Monsieur	1
Kuragin	1
has	1
not	1
honored	1
Countess	1
Rostova	1
with	1
his	1
hand?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
he	1
snorted	1
several	1
times.	1
	1
"He	1
could	1
not	1
marry,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
married	1
already,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
laughed	1
disagreeably,	1
again	1
reminding	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
"And	1
where	1
is	1
your	1
brother-in-law	1
now,	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
ask?"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
Peters...	1
But	1
I	1
don't	1
know,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
doesn't	1
matter,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Tell	1
Countess	1
Rostova	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
is	1
perfectly	1
free	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
wish	1
her	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
good."	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
the	1
packet.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
more	1
to	1
say,	1
or	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
Pierre	1
would	1
say	1
anything,	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
our	1
discussion	1
in	1
Petersburg?"	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
"about..."	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
returned	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
hastily.	1
"I	1
said	1
that	1
a	1
fallen	1
woman	1
should	1
be	1
forgiven,	1
but	1
I	1
didn't	1
say	1
I	1
could	1
forgive	1
her.	1
I	1
can't."	1
	1
"But	1
can	1
this	1
be	1
compared...?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
interrupted	1
him	1
and	1
cried	1
sharply:	1
"Yes,	1
ask	1
her	1
hand	1
again,	1
be	1
magnanimous,	1
and	1
so	1
on?...	1
Yes,	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
noble,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
follow	1
in	1
that	1
gentleman's	1
footsteps.	1
If	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
friend	1
never	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
that...	1
of	1
all	1
that!	1
Well,	1
good-by.	1
So	1
you'll	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
packet?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
seemed	1
livelier	1
than	1
usual.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
always,	1
but	1
beneath	1
her	1
sympathy	1
for	1
her	1
brother,	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
the	1
engagement	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
off.	1
Looking	1
at	1
them	1
Pierre	1
realized	1
what	1
contempt	1
and	1
animosity	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
in	1
their	1
presence	1
even	1
to	1
mention	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
could	1
give	1
up	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
for	1
anyone	1
else.	1
	1
At	1
dinner	1
the	1
talk	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
war,	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
becoming	1
evident.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
talked	1
incessantly,	1
arguing	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
father,	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
Swiss	1
tutor	1
Dessalles,	1
and	1
showing	1
an	1
unnatural	1
animation,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
which	1
Pierre	1
so	1
well	1
understood.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXII	1
	1
That	1
same	1
evening	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
to	1
fulfill	1
the	1
commission	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
in	1
bed,	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
the	1
club,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
after	1
giving	1
the	1
letters	1
to	1
Sonya,	1
went	1
to	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
who	1
was	1
interested	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
news.	1
Ten	1
minutes	1
later	1
Sonya	1
came	1
to	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
"Natasha	1
insists	1
on	1
seeing	1
Count	1
Peter	1
Kirilovich,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"But	1
how?	1
Are	1
we	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
her?	1
The	1
room	1
there	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
tidied	1
up."	1
	1
"No,	1
she	1
has	1
dressed	1
and	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
only	1
shrugged	1
her	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"When	1
will	1
her	1
mother	1
come?	1
She	1
has	1
worried	1
me	1
to	1
death!	1
Now	1
mind,	1
don't	1
tell	1
her	1
everything!"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"One	1
hasn't	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
scold	1
her,	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied,	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied."	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
emaciated,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
set	1
face,	1
but	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
shamefaced	1
as	1
Pierre	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
her.	1
When	1
he	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
she	1
grew	1
flurried,	1
evidently	1
undecided	1
whether	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
or	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
up.	1
	1
Pierre	1
hastened	1
to	1
her.	1
He	1
thought	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
usual;	1
but	1
she,	1
stepping	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
stopped,	1
breathing	1
heavily,	1
her	1
arms	1
hanging	1
lifelessly	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
pose	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom	1
to	1
sing,	1
but	1
with	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
expression	1
of	1
face.	1
	1
"Peter	1
Kirilovich,"	1
she	1
began	1
rapidly,	1
"Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
your	1
friend--is	1
your	1
friend,"	1
she	1
corrected	1
herself.	1
(It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
must	1
now	1
be	1
different.)	1
"He	1
told	1
me	1
once	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
you..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
sniffed	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
speak.	1
Till	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
reproached	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
despise	1
her,	1
but	1
he	1
now	1
felt	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
room	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
for	1
reproach.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
here	1
now:	1
tell	1
him...	1
to	1
for...	1
forgive	1
me!"	1
She	1
stopped	1
and	1
breathed	1
still	1
more	1
quickly,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
shed	1
tears.	1
	1
"Yes...	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
him,"	1
answered	1
Pierre;	1
"but..."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
evidently	1
dismayed	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
might	1
think	1
she	1
had	1
meant.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
is	1
over,"	1
she	1
said	1
hurriedly.	1
"No,	1
that	1
can	1
never	1
be.	1
I'm	1
only	1
tormented	1
by	1
the	1
wrong	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
him.	1
Tell	1
him	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
beg	1
him	1
to	1
forgive,	1
forgive,	1
forgive	1
me	1
for	1
everything...."	1
	1
She	1
trembled	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
chair.	1
	1
A	1
sense	1
of	1
pity	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
known	1
overflowed	1
Pierre's	1
heart.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
him,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
him	1
everything	1
once	1
more,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"But...	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
one	1
thing...."	1
	1
"Know	1
what?"	1
Natasha's	1
eyes	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know,	1
did	1
you	1
love..."	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
refer	1
to	1
Anatole	1
and	1
flushed	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him--"did	1
you	1
love	1
that	1
bad	1
man?"	1
	1
"Don't	1
call	1
him	1
bad!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
don't	1
know	1
at	1
all...."	1
	1
She	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
sense	1
of	1
pity,	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
love	1
welled	1
up	1
in	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
felt	1
the	1
tears	1
trickle	1
under	1
his	1
spectacles	1
and	1
hoped	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
noticed.	1
	1
"We	1
won't	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
any	1
more,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
his	1
gentle,	1
cordial	1
tone	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
very	1
strange	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"We	1
won't	1
speak	1
of	1
it,	1
my	1
dear--I'll	1
tell	1
him	1
everything;	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
you,	1
consider	1
me	1
your	1
friend	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
help,	1
advice,	1
or	1
simply	1
to	1
open	1
your	1
heart	1
to	1
someone--not	1
now,	1
but	1
when	1
your	1
mind	1
is	1
clearer	1
think	1
of	1
me!"	1
He	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it.	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
if	1
it's	1
in	1
my	1
power..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
grew	1
confused.	1
	1
"Don't	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
that.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worth	1
it!"	1
exclaimed	1
Natasha	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
held	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
He	1
knew	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
words.	1
	1
"Stop,	1
stop!	1
You	1
have	1
your	1
whole	1
life	1
before	1
you,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
	1
"Before	1
me?	1
No!	1
All	1
is	1
over	1
for	1
me,"	1
she	1
replied	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
self-	1
abasement.	1
	1
"All	1
over?"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
"If	1
I	1
were	1
not	1
myself,	1
but	1
the	1
handsomest,	1
cleverest,	1
and	1
best	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
were	1
free,	1
I	1
would	1
this	1
moment	1
ask	1
on	1
my	1
knees	1
for	1
your	1
hand	1
and	1
your	1
love!"	1
	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
Natasha	1
wept	1
tears	1
of	1
gratitude	1
and	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
Pierre	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Pierre	1
too	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
almost	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
restraining	1
tears	1
of	1
tenderness	1
and	1
joy	1
that	1
choked	1
him,	1
and	1
without	1
finding	1
the	1
sleeves	1
of	1
his	1
fur	1
cloak	1
threw	1
it	1
on	1
and	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
sleigh.	1
	1
"Where	1
to	1
now,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
asked	1
the	1
coachman.	1
	1
"Where	1
to?"	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
himself.	1
"Where	1
can	1
I	1
go	1
now?	1
Surely	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
or	1
to	1
pay	1
calls?"	1
All	1
men	1
seemed	1
so	1
pitiful,	1
so	1
poor,	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
this	1
feeling	1
of	1
tenderness	1
and	1
love	1
he	1
experienced:	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
that	1
softened,	1
grateful,	1
last	1
look	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
	1
"Home!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
despite	1
twenty-two	1
degrees	1
of	1
frost	1
Fahrenheit	1
he	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
bearskin	1
cloak	1
from	1
his	1
broad	1
chest	1
and	1
inhaled	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
frosty.	1
Above	1
the	1
dirty,	1
ill-lit	1
streets,	1
above	1
the	1
black	1
roofs,	1
stretched	1
the	1
dark	1
starry	1
sky.	1
Only	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
did	1
Pierre	1
cease	1
to	1
feel	1
how	1
sordid	1
and	1
humiliating	1
were	1
all	1
mundane	1
things	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
heights	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
soul	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
raised.	1
At	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
Arbat	1
Square	1
an	1
immense	1
expanse	1
of	1
dark	1
starry	1
sky	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Almost	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
it,	1
above	1
the	1
Prechistenka	1
Boulevard,	1
surrounded	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
by	1
stars	1
but	1
distinguished	1
from	1
them	1
all	1
by	1
its	1
nearness	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
its	1
white	1
light,	1
and	1
its	1
long	1
uplifted	1
tail,	1
shone	1
the	1
enormous	1
and	1
brilliant	1
comet	1
of	1
1812--the	1
comet	1
which	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
portend	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
woes	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
In	1
Pierre,	1
however,	1
that	1
comet	1
with	1
its	1
long	1
luminous	1
tail	1
aroused	1
no	1
feeling	1
of	1
fear.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
gazed	1
joyfully,	1
his	1
eyes	1
moist	1
with	1
tears,	1
at	1
this	1
bright	1
comet	1
which,	1
having	1
traveled	1
in	1
its	1
orbit	1
with	1
inconceivable	1
velocity	1
through	1
immeasurable	1
space,	1
seemed	1
suddenly--like	1
an	1
arrow	1
piercing	1
the	1
earth--to	1
remain	1
fixed	1
in	1
a	1
chosen	1
spot,	1
vigorously	1
holding	1
its	1
tail	1
erect,	1
shining	1
and	1
displaying	1
its	1
white	1
light	1
amid	1
countless	1
other	1
scintillating	1
stars.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
this	1
comet	1
fully	1
responded	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
softened	1
and	1
uplifted	1
soul,	1
now	1
blossoming	1
into	1
a	1
new	1
life.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
From	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
1811	1
intensified	1
arming	1
and	1
concentrating	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
Western	1
Europe	1
began,	1
and	1
in	1
1812	1
these	1
forces--millions	1
of	1
men,	1
reckoning	1
those	1
transporting	1
and	1
feeding	1
the	1
army--moved	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
eastwards	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
frontier,	1
toward	1
which	1
since	1
1811	1
Russian	1
forces	1
had	1
been	1
similarly	1
drawn.	1
On	1
the	1
twelfth	1
of	1
June,	1
1812,	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
Western	1
Europe	1
crossed	1
the	1
Russian	1
frontier	1
and	1
war	1
began,	1
that	1
is,	1
an	1
event	1
took	1
place	1
opposed	1
to	1
human	1
reason	1
and	1
to	1
human	1
nature.	1
Millions	1
of	1
men	1
perpetrated	1
against	1
one	1
another	1
such	1
innumerable	1
crimes,	1
frauds,	1
treacheries,	1
thefts,	1
forgeries,	1
issues	1
of	1
false	1
money,	1
burglaries,	1
incendiarisms,	1
and	1
murders	1
as	1
in	1
whole	1
centuries	1
are	1
not	1
recorded	1
in	1
the	1
annals	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
which	1
those	1
who	1
committed	1
them	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
regard	1
as	1
being	1
crimes.	1
	1
What	1
produced	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
occurrence?	1
What	1
were	1
its	1
causes?	1
The	1
historians	1
tell	1
us	1
with	1
naive	1
assurance	1
that	1
its	1
causes	1
were	1
the	1
wrongs	1
inflicted	1
on	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Oldenburg,	1
the	1
nonobservance	1
of	1
the	1
Continental	1
System,	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
Alexander,	1
the	1
mistakes	1
of	1
the	1
diplomatists,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
Consequently,	1
it	1
would	1
only	1
have	1
been	1
necessary	1
for	1
Metternich,	1
Rumyantsev,	1
or	1
Talleyrand,	1
between	1
a	1
levee	1
and	1
an	1
evening	1
party,	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
proper	1
pains	1
and	1
written	1
a	1
more	1
adroit	1
note,	1
or	1
for	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
Alexander:	1
"My	1
respected	1
Brother,	1
I	1
consent	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
duchy	1
to	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Oldenburg"--and	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
war.	1
	1
We	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
seemed	1
like	1
that	1
to	1
contemporaries.	1
It	1
naturally	1
seemed	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
caused	1
by	1
England's	1
intrigues	1
(as	1
in	1
fact	1
he	1
said	1
on	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
St.	1
Helena).	1
It	1
naturally	1
seemed	1
to	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
Parliament	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
Napoleon's	1
ambition;	1
to	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Oldenburg,	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
the	1
violence	1
done	1
to	1
him;	1
to	1
businessmen	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
the	1
Continental	1
System	1
which	1
was	1
ruining	1
Europe;	1
to	1
the	1
generals	1
and	1
old	1
soldiers	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
giving	1
them	1
employment;	1
to	1
the	1
legitimists	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
re-establishing	1
les	1
bons	1
principes,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
diplomatists	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
all	1
resulted	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
alliance	1
between	1
Russia	1
and	1
Austria	1
in	1
1809	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
sufficiently	1
well	1
concealed	1
from	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
awkward	1
wording	1
of	1
Memorandum	1
No.	1
178.	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
that	1
these	1
and	1
a	1
countless	1
and	1
infinite	1
quantity	1
of	1
other	1
reasons,	1
the	1
number	1
depending	1
on	1
the	1
endless	1
diversity	1
of	1
points	1
of	1
view,	1
presented	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
day;	1
but	1
to	1
us,	1
to	1
posterity	1
who	1
view	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
happened	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
magnitude	1
and	1
perceive	1
its	1
plain	1
and	1
terrible	1
meaning,	1
these	1
causes	1
seem	1
insufficient.	1
To	1
us	1
it	1
is	1
incomprehensible	1
that	1
millions	1
of	1
Christian	1
men	1
killed	1
and	1
tortured	1
each	1
other	1
either	1
because	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
ambitious	1
or	1
Alexander	1
was	1
firm,	1
or	1
because	1
England's	1
policy	1
was	1
astute	1
or	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Oldenburg	1
wronged.	1
We	1
cannot	1
grasp	1
what	1
connection	1
such	1
circumstances	1
have	1
with	1
the	1
actual	1
fact	1
of	1
slaughter	1
and	1
violence:	1
why	1
because	1
the	1
Duke	1
was	1
wronged,	1
thousands	1
of	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Europe	1
killed	1
and	1
ruined	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
Moscow	1
and	1
were	1
killed	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
To	1
us,	1
their	1
descendants,	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
historians	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
research	1
and	1
can	1
therefore	1
regard	1
the	1
event	1
with	1
unclouded	1
common	1
sense,	1
an	1
incalculable	1
number	1
of	1
causes	1
present	1
themselves.	1
The	1
deeper	1
we	1
delve	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
these	1
causes	1
the	1
more	1
of	1
them	1
we	1
find;	1
and	1
each	1
separate	1
cause	1
or	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
causes	1
appears	1
to	1
us	1
equally	1
valid	1
in	1
itself	1
and	1
equally	1
false	1
by	1
its	1
insignificance	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
magnitude	1
of	1
the	1
events,	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
impotence--apart	1
from	1
the	1
cooperation	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
coincident	1
causes--to	1
occasion	1
the	1
event.	1
To	1
us,	1
the	1
wish	1
or	1
objection	1
of	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
French	1
corporal	1
to	1
serve	1
a	1
second	1
term	1
appears	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
cause	1
as	1
Napoleon's	1
refusal	1
to	1
withdraw	1
his	1
troops	1
beyond	1
the	1
Vistula	1
and	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
duchy	1
of	1
Oldenburg;	1
for	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
wished	1
to	1
serve,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
second,	1
a	1
third,	1
and	1
a	1
thousandth	1
corporal	1
and	1
private	1
also	1
refused,	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
many	1
less	1
men	1
in	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
war	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
occurred.	1
	1
Had	1
Napoleon	1
not	1
taken	1
offense	1
at	1
the	1
demand	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
withdraw	1
beyond	1
the	1
Vistula,	1
and	1
not	1
ordered	1
his	1
troops	1
to	1
advance,	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
war;	1
but	1
had	1
all	1
his	1
sergeants	1
objected	1
to	1
serving	1
a	1
second	1
term	1
then	1
also	1
there	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
war.	1
Nor	1
could	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
war	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
no	1
English	1
intrigues	1
and	1
no	1
Duke	1
of	1
Oldenburg,	1
and	1
had	1
Alexander	1
not	1
felt	1
insulted,	1
and	1
had	1
there	1
not	1
been	1
an	1
autocratic	1
government	1
in	1
Russia,	1
or	1
a	1
Revolution	1
in	1
France	1
and	1
a	1
subsequent	1
dictatorship	1
and	1
Empire,	1
or	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
produced	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Without	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
causes	1
nothing	1
could	1
have	1
happened.	1
So	1
all	1
these	1
causes--myriads	1
of	1
causes--coincided	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
about.	1
And	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
cause	1
for	1
that	1
occurrence,	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
occur	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
to.	1
Millions	1
of	1
men,	1
renouncing	1
their	1
human	1
feelings	1
and	1
reason,	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east	1
to	1
slay	1
their	1
fellows,	1
just	1
as	1
some	1
centuries	1
previously	1
hordes	1
of	1
men	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
the	1
west,	1
slaying	1
their	1
fellows.	1
	1
The	1
actions	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
Alexander,	1
on	1
whose	1
words	1
the	1
event	1
seemed	1
to	1
hang,	1
were	1
as	1
little	1
voluntary	1
as	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
any	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
drawn	1
into	1
the	1
campaign	1
by	1
lot	1
or	1
by	1
conscription.	1
This	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise,	1
for	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
Alexander	1
(on	1
whom	1
the	1
event	1
seemed	1
to	1
depend)	1
should	1
be	1
carried	1
out,	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
innumerable	1
circumstances	1
was	1
needed	1
without	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
event	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
taken	1
place.	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
whose	1
hands	1
lay	1
the	1
real	1
power--the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
fired,	1
or	1
transported	1
provisions	1
and	1
guns--should	1
consent	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
these	1
weak	1
individuals,	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
induced	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
by	1
an	1
infinite	1
number	1
of	1
diverse	1
and	1
complex	1
causes.	1
	1
We	1
are	1
forced	1
to	1
fall	1
back	1
on	1
fatalism	1
as	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
irrational	1
events	1
(that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
events	1
the	1
reasonableness	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
understand).	1
The	1
more	1
we	1
try	1
to	1
explain	1
such	1
events	1
in	1
history	1
reasonably,	1
the	1
more	1
unreasonable	1
and	1
incomprehensible	1
do	1
they	1
become	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
Each	1
man	1
lives	1
for	1
himself,	1
using	1
his	1
freedom	1
to	1
attain	1
his	1
personal	1
aims,	1
and	1
feels	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
being	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
now	1
do	1
or	1
abstain	1
from	1
doing	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
action;	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
it,	1
that	1
action	1
performed	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
moment	1
in	1
time	1
becomes	1
irrevocable	1
and	1
belongs	1
to	1
history,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
free	1
but	1
a	1
predestined	1
significance.	1
	1
There	1
are	1
two	1
sides	1
to	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
every	1
man,	1
his	1
individual	1
life,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
free	1
the	1
more	1
abstract	1
its	1
interests,	1
and	1
his	1
elemental	1
hive	1
life	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
inevitably	1
obeys	1
laws	1
laid	1
down	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
Man	1
lives	1
consciously	1
for	1
himself,	1
but	1
is	1
an	1
unconscious	1
instrument	1
in	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
the	1
historic,	1
universal,	1
aims	1
of	1
humanity.	1
A	1
deed	1
done	1
is	1
irrevocable,	1
and	1
its	1
result	1
coinciding	1
in	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
other	1
men	1
assumes	1
an	1
historic	1
significance.	1
The	1
higher	1
a	1
man	1
stands	1
on	1
the	1
social	1
ladder,	1
the	1
more	1
people	1
he	1
is	1
connected	1
with	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
power	1
he	1
has	1
over	1
others,	1
the	1
more	1
evident	1
is	1
the	1
predestination	1
and	1
inevitability	1
of	1
his	1
every	1
action.	1
	1
"The	1
king's	1
heart	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lord."	1
	1
A	1
king	1
is	1
history's	1
slave.	1
	1
History,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
unconscious,	1
general,	1
hive	1
life	1
of	1
mankind,	1
uses	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
kings	1
as	1
a	1
tool	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
purposes.	1
	1
Though	1
Napoleon	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
in	1
1812,	1
was	1
more	1
convinced	1
than	1
ever	1
that	1
it	1
depended	1
on	1
him,	1
verser	1
(ou	1

peuples	1
*--	1
as	1
Alexander	1
expressed	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
he	1
wrote	1
him--he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
grip	1
of	1
inevitable	1
laws,	1
which	1
compelled	1
him,	1
while	1
thinking	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
acting	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
volition,	1
to	1
perform	1
for	1
the	1
hive	1
life--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
for	1
history--whatever	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
performed.	1

*	1
"To	1

not	1
to	1

	1
The	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
moved	1
eastwards	1
to	1
slay	1
their	1
fellow	1
men,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
coincidence	1
thousands	1
of	1
minute	1
causes	1
fitted	1
in	1
and	1
co-	1
ordinated	1
to	1
produce	1
that	1
movement	1
and	1
war:	1
reproaches	1
for	1
the	1
nonobservance	1
of	1
the	1
Continental	1
System,	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Oldenburg's	1
wrongs,	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
troops	1
into	1
Prussia--undertaken	1
(as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Napoleon)	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
securing	1
an	1
armed	1
peace,	1
the	1
French	1
Emperor's	1
love	1
and	1
habit	1
of	1
war	1
coinciding	1
with	1
his	1
people's	1
inclinations,	1
allurement	1
by	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
the	1
preparations,	1
and	1
the	1
expenditure	1
on	1
those	1
preparations	1
and	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
obtaining	1
advantages	1
to	1
compensate	1
for	1
that	1
expenditure,	1
the	1
intoxicating	1
honors	1
he	1
received	1
in	1
Dresden,	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
negotiations	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
contemporaries,	1
were	1
carried	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
sincere	1
desire	1
to	1
attain	1
peace,	1
but	1
which	1
only	1
wounded	1
the	1
self-love	1
of	1
both	1
sides,	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
other	1
causes	1
that	1
adapted	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
event	1
that	1
was	1
happening	1
or	1
coincided	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
When	1
an	1
apple	1
has	1
ripened	1
and	1
falls,	1
why	1
does	1
it	1
fall?	1
Because	1
of	1
its	1
attraction	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
because	1
its	1
stalk	1
withers,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
dried	1
by	1
the	1
sun,	1
because	1
it	1
grows	1
heavier,	1
because	1
the	1
wind	1
shakes	1
it,	1
or	1
because	1
the	1
boy	1
standing	1
below	1
wants	1
to	1
eat	1
it?	1
	1
Nothing	1
is	1
the	1
cause.	1
All	1
this	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
coincidence	1
of	1
conditions	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
vital	1
organic	1
and	1
elemental	1
events	1
occur.	1
And	1
the	1
botanist	1
who	1
finds	1
that	1
the	1
apple	1
falls	1
because	1
the	1
cellular	1
tissue	1
decays	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
is	1
equally	1
right	1
with	1
the	1
child	1
who	1
stands	1
under	1
the	1
tree	1
and	1
says	1
the	1
apple	1
fell	1
because	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
eat	1
it	1
and	1
prayed	1
for	1
it.	1
Equally	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
is	1
he	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
because	1
he	1
wanted	1
to,	1
and	1
perished	1
because	1
Alexander	1
desired	1
his	1
destruction,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
an	1
undermined	1
hill	1
weighing	1
a	1
million	1
tons	1
fell	1
because	1
the	1
last	1
navvy	1
struck	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
with	1
his	1
mattock.	1
In	1
historic	1
events	1
the	1
so-called	1
great	1
men	1
are	1
labels	1
giving	1
names	1
to	1
events,	1
and	1
like	1
labels	1
they	1
have	1
but	1
the	1
smallest	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
event	1
itself.	1
	1
Every	1
act	1
of	1
theirs,	1
which	1
appears	1
to	1
them	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
will,	1
is	1
in	1
an	1
historical	1
sense	1
involuntary	1
and	1
is	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
history	1
and	1
predestined	1
from	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-ninth	1
of	1
May	1
Napoleon	1
left	1
Dresden,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
three	1
weeks	1
surrounded	1
by	1
a	1
court	1
that	1
included	1
princes,	1
dukes,	1
kings,	1
and	1
even	1
an	1
emperor.	1
Before	1
leaving,	1
Napoleon	1
showed	1
favor	1
to	1
the	1
emperor,	1
kings,	1
and	1
princes	1
who	1
had	1
deserved	1
it,	1
reprimanded	1
the	1
kings	1
and	1
princes	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
dissatisfied,	1
presented	1
pearls	1
and	1
diamonds	1
of	1
his	1
own--that	1
is,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
other	1
kings--to	1
the	1
Empress	1
of	1
Austria,	1
and	1
having,	1
as	1
his	1
historian	1
tells	1
us,	1
tenderly	1
embraced	1
the	1
Empress	1
Marie	1
Louise--who	1
regarded	1
him	1
as	1
her	1
husband,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
another	1
wife	1
in	1
Paris--left	1
her	1
grieved	1
by	1
the	1
parting	1
which	1
she	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
bear.	1
Though	1
the	1
diplomatists	1
still	1
firmly	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
worked	1
zealously	1
to	1
that	1
end,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Alexander,	1
calling	1
him	1
Monsieur	1
mon	1
frere,	1
and	1
sincerely	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
war	1
and	1
would	1
always	1
love	1
and	1
honor	1
him--yet	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
join	1
his	1
army,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
station	1
gave	1
fresh	1
orders	1
to	1
accelerate	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
troops	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east.	1
He	1
went	1
in	1
a	1
traveling	1
coach	1
with	1
six	1
horses,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
pages,	1
aides-de-camp,	1
and	1
an	1
escort,	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Posen,	1
Thorn,	1
Danzig,	1
and	1
Konigsberg.	1
At	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
towns	1
thousands	1
of	1
people	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
excitement	1
and	1
enthusiasm.	1
	1
The	1
army	1
was	1
moving	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east,	1
and	1
relays	1
of	1
six	1
horses	1
carried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction.	1
On	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
June,	1
*	1
coming	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
army,	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
apartments	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
estate	1
of	1
a	1
Polish	1
count	1
in	1
the	1
Vilkavisski	1
forest.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Old	1
style.	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
overtaking	1
the	1
army,	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
to	1
the	1
Niemen,	1
and,	1
changing	1
into	1
a	1
Polish	1
uniform,	1
he	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
riverbank	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
select	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
crossing.	1
	1
Seeing,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
some	1
Cossacks	1
(les	1
Cosaques)	1
and	1
the	1
wide-	1
spreading	1
steppes	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
which	1
lay	1
the	1
holy	1
city	1
of	1
Moscow	1
(Moscou,	1
la	1
ville	1
sainte),	1
the	1
capital	1
of	1
a	1
realm	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
Scythia	1
into	1
which	1
Alexander	1
the	1
Great	1
had	1
marched--Napoleon	1
unexpectedly,	1
and	1
contrary	1
alike	1
to	1
strategic	1
and	1
diplomatic	1
considerations,	1
ordered	1
an	1
advance,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
his	1
army	1
began	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
Niemen.	1
	1
Early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
twelfth	1
of	1
June	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
tent,	1
which	1
was	1
pitched	1
that	1
day	1
on	1
the	1
steep	1
left	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Niemen,	1
and	1
looked	1
through	1
a	1
spyglass	1
at	1
the	1
streams	1
of	1
his	1
troops	1
pouring	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Vilkavisski	1
forest	1
and	1
flowing	1
over	1
the	1
three	1
bridges	1
thrown	1
across	1
the	1
river.	1
The	1
troops,	1
knowing	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
presence,	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
figure	1
in	1
an	1
overcoat	1
and	1
a	1
cocked	1
hat	1
standing	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
suite	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
tent	1
on	1
the	1
hill,	1
they	1
threw	1
up	1
their	1
caps	1
and	1
shouted:	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
and	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
poured	1
in	1
a	1
ceaseless	1
stream	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vast	1
forest	1
that	1
had	1
concealed	1
them	1
and,	1
separating,	1
flowed	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
three	1
bridges	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
"Now	1
we'll	1
go	1
into	1
action.	1
Oh,	1
when	1
he	1
takes	1
it	1
in	1
hand	1
himself,	1
things	1
get	1
hot...	1
by	1
heaven!...	1
There	1
he	1
is!...	1
Vive	1
l'Empereur!	1
So	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
steppes	1
of	1
Asia!	1
It's	1
a	1
nasty	1
country	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
Au	1
revoir,	1
Beauche;	1
I'll	1
keep	1
the	1
best	1
palace	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
you!	1
Au	1
revoir.	1
Good	1
luck!...	1
Did	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
Emperor?	1
Vive	1
l'Empereur!...	1
preur!--If	1
they	1
make	1
me	1
Governor	1
of	1
India,	1
Gerard,	1
I'll	1
make	1
you	1
Minister	1
of	1
Kashmir--	1
that's	1
settled.	1
Vive	1
l'Empereur!	1
Hurrah!	1
hurrah!	1
hurrah!	1
The	1
Cossacks--	1
those	1
rascals--see	1
how	1
they	1
run!	1
Vive	1
l'Empereur!	1
There	1
he	1
is,	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
him?	1
I've	1
seen	1
him	1
twice,	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
now.	1
The	1
little	1
corporal...	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
give	1
the	1
cross	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
veterans....	1
Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
came	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
men,	1
old	1
and	1
young,	1
of	1
most	1
diverse	1
characters	1
and	1
social	1
positions.	1
On	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
one	1
common	1
expression	1
of	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
long-expected	1
campaign	1
and	1
of	1
rapture	1
and	1
devotion	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
gray	1
coat	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
of	1
June	1
a	1
rather	1
small,	1
thoroughbred	1
Arab	1
horse	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
Napoleon.	1
He	1
mounted	1
it	1
and	1
rode	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bridges	1
over	1
the	1
Niemen,	1
deafened	1
continually	1
by	1
incessant	1
and	1
rapturous	1
acclamations	1
which	1
he	1
evidently	1
endured	1
only	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
forbid	1
the	1
soldiers	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
love	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
such	1
shouting,	1
but	1
the	1
shouting	1
which	1
accompanied	1
him	1
everywhere	1
disturbed	1
him	1
and	1
distracted	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
military	1
cares	1
that	1
had	1
occupied	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
joined	1
the	1
army.	1
He	1
rode	1
across	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
swaying	1
pontoon	1
bridges	1
to	1
the	1
farther	1
side,	1
turned	1
sharply	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
galloped	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Kovno,	1
preceded	1
by	1
enraptured,	1
mounted	1
chasseurs	1
of	1
the	1
Guard	1
who,	1
breathless	1
with	1
delight,	1
galloped	1
ahead	1
to	1
clear	1
a	1
path	1
for	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
troops.	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
broad	1
river	1
Viliya,	1
he	1
stopped	1
near	1
a	1
regiment	1
of	1
Polish	1
uhlans	1
stationed	1
by	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
"Vivat!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
Poles,	1
ecstatically,	1
breaking	1
their	1
ranks	1
and	1
pressing	1
against	1
one	1
another	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
river,	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
log	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
bank.	1
At	1
a	1
mute	1
sign	1
from	1
him,	1
a	1
telescope	1
was	1
handed	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
happy	1
page	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
bank.	1
Then	1
he	1
became	1
absorbed	1
in	1
a	1
map	1
laid	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
logs.	1
Without	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
said	1
something,	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
aides-de-camp	1
galloped	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
Polish	1
uhlans.	1
	1
"What?	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
say?"	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
Polish	1
uhlans	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
aides-de-camp	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
order	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
ford	1
and	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
river.	1
The	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
Polish	1
uhlans,	1
a	1
handsome	1
old	1
man,	1
flushed	1
and,	1
fumbling	1
in	1
his	1
speech	1
from	1
excitement,	1
asked	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
permitted	1
to	1
swim	1
the	1
river	1
with	1
his	1
uhlans	1
instead	1
of	1
seeking	1
a	1
ford.	1
In	1
evident	1
fear	1
of	1
refusal,	1
like	1
a	1
boy	1
asking	1
for	1
permission	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
a	1
horse,	1
he	1
begged	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
swim	1
across	1
the	1
river	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes.	1
The	1
aide-de-camp	1
replied	1
that	1
probably	1
the	1
Emperor	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
displeased	1
at	1
this	1
excess	1
of	1
zeal.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
the	1
old	1
mustached	1
officer,	1
with	1
happy	1
face	1
and	1
sparkling	1
eyes,	1
raised	1
his	1
saber,	1
shouted	1
"Vivat!"	1
and,	1
commanding	1
the	1
uhlans	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
into	1
the	1
river.	1
He	1
gave	1
an	1
angry	1
thrust	1
to	1
his	1
horse,	1
which	1
had	1
grown	1
restive	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
heading	1
for	1
the	1
deepest	1
part	1
where	1
the	1
current	1
was	1
swift.	1
Hundreds	1
of	1
uhlans	1
galloped	1
in	1
after	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
uncanny	1
in	1
the	1
rapid	1
current	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
stream,	1
and	1
the	1
uhlans	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
they	1
fell	1
off	1
their	1
horses.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
drowned	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
men;	1
the	1
others	1
tried	1
to	1
swim	1
on,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
and	1
some	1
clinging	1
to	1
their	1
horses'	1
manes.	1
They	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
way	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
bank	1
and,	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
ford	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
away,	1
were	1
proud	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
swimming	1
and	1
drowning	1
in	1
this	1
river	1
under	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
log	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
looking	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing.	1
When	1
the	1
aide-de-camp,	1
having	1
returned	1
and	1
choosing	1
an	1
opportune	1
moment,	1
ventured	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
devotion	1
of	1
the	1
Poles	1
to	1
his	1
person,	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
gray	1
overcoat	1
got	1
up	1
and,	1
having	1
summoned	1
Berthier,	1
began	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
bank	1
with	1
him,	1
giving	1
him	1
instructions	1
and	1
occasionally	1
glancing	1
disapprovingly	1
at	1
the	1
drowning	1
uhlans	1
who	1
distracted	1
his	1
attention.	1
	1
For	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
new	1
conviction	1
that	1
his	1
presence	1
in	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
from	1
Africa	1
to	1
the	1
steppes	1
of	1
Muscovy	1
alike,	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
dumfound	1
people	1
and	1
impel	1
them	1
to	1
insane	1
self-oblivion.	1
He	1
called	1
for	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
to	1
his	1
quarters.	1
	1
Some	1
forty	1
uhlans	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
river,	1
though	1
boats	1
were	1
sent	1
to	1
their	1
assistance.	1
The	1
majority	1
struggled	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
bank	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
started.	1
The	1
colonel	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
men	1
got	1
across	1
and	1
with	1
difficulty	1
clambered	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
further	1
bank.	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
got	1
out,	1
in	1
their	1
soaked	1
and	1
streaming	1
clothes,	1
they	1
shouted	1
"Vivat!"	1
and	1
looked	1
ecstatically	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
where	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
was	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
considered	1
themselves	1
happy.	1
	1
That	1
evening,	1
between	1
issuing	1
one	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
forged	1
Russian	1
paper	1
money	1
prepared	1
for	1
use	1
in	1
Russia	1
should	1
be	1
delivered	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
another	1
that	1
a	1
Saxon	1
should	1
be	1
shot,	1
on	1
whom	1
a	1
letter	1
containing	1
information	1
about	1
the	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
had	1
been	1
found,	1
Napoleon	1
also	1
gave	1
instructions	1
that	1
the	1
Polish	1
colonel	1
who	1
had	1
needlessly	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
should	1
be	1
enrolled	1
in	1
the	1
Legion	1
d'honneur	1
of	1
which	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
himself	1
the	1
head.	1
	1
Quos	1
vult	1

*	1
	1
	1
*	1
Those	1
whom	1
(God)	1
wishes	1
to	1
destroy	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Russia	1
had,	1
meanwhile,	1
been	1
in	1
Vilna	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
month,	1
reviewing	1
troops	1
and	1
holding	1
maneuvers.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
war	1
that	1
everyone	1
expected	1
and	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Petersburg.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
general	1
plan	1
of	1
action.	1
The	1
vacillation	1
between	1
the	1
various	1
plans	1
that	1
were	1
proposed	1
had	1
even	1
increased	1
after	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
headquarters	1
for	1
a	1
month.	1
Each	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
armies	1
had	1
its	1
own	1
commander-in-chief,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
supreme	1
commander	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
forces,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
did	1
not	1
assume	1
that	1
responsibility	1
himself.	1
	1
The	1
longer	1
the	1
Emperor	1
remained	1
in	1
Vilna	1
the	1
less	1
did	1
everybody--tired	1
of	1
waiting--prepare	1
for	1
the	1
war.	1
All	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
surrounded	1
the	1
sovereign	1
seemed	1
directed	1
merely	1
to	1
making	1
him	1
spend	1
his	1
time	1
pleasantly	1
and	1
forget	1
that	1
war	1
was	1
impending.	1
	1
In	1
June,	1
after	1
many	1
balls	1
and	1
fetes	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
Polish	1
magnates,	1
by	1
the	1
courtiers,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself,	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Polish	1
aides-de-camp	1
in	1
attendance	1
that	1
a	1
dinner	1
and	1
ball	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
by	1
his	1
aides-de-camp.	1
This	1
idea	1
was	1
eagerly	1
received.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
gave	1
his	1
consent.	1
The	1
aides-de-camp	1
collected	1
money	1
by	1
subscription.	1
The	1
lady	1
who	1
was	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
most	1
pleasing	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
invited	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
hostess.	1
Count	1
Bennigsen,	1
being	1
a	1
landowner	1
in	1
the	1
Vilna	1
province,	1
offered	1
his	1
country	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
fete,	1
and	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
of	1
June	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
a	1
ball,	1
dinner,	1
regatta,	1
and	1
fireworks	1
at	1
Zakret,	1
Count	1
Bennigsen's	1
country	1
seat.	1
	1
The	1
very	1
day	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
issued	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
Niemen,	1
and	1
his	1
vanguard,	1
driving	1
off	1
the	1
Cossacks,	1
crossed	1
the	1
Russian	1
frontier,	1
Alexander	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
entertainment	1
given	1
by	1
his	1
aides-de-	1
camp	1
at	1
Bennigsen's	1
country	1
house.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
gay	1
and	1
brilliant	1
fete.	1
Connoisseurs	1
of	1
such	1
matters	1
declared	1
that	1
rarely	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
beautiful	1
women	1
been	1
assembled	1
in	1
one	1
place.	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
was	1
present	1
among	1
other	1
Russian	1
ladies	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
the	1
sovereign	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
Vilna	1
and	1
eclipsed	1
the	1
refined	1
Polish	1
ladies	1
by	1
her	1
massive,	1
so-called	1
Russian	1
type	1
of	1
beauty.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
noticed	1
her	1
and	1
honored	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
dance.	1
	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy,	1
having	1
left	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
being	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
en	1
garcon	1
(as	1
he	1
phrased	1
it),	1
was	1
also	1
there	1
and,	1
though	1
not	1
an	1
aide-de-camp,	1
had	1
subscribed	1
a	1
large	1
sum	1
toward	1
the	1
expenses.	1
Boris	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
high	1
honors	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
sought	1
patronage	1
but	1
stood	1
on	1
an	1
equal	1
footing	1
with	1
the	1
highest	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
age.	1
He	1
was	1
meeting	1
Helene	1
in	1
Vilna	1
after	1
not	1
having	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
recall	1
the	1
past,	1
but	1
as	1
Helene	1
was	1
enjoying	1
the	1
favors	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
personage	1
and	1
Boris	1
had	1
only	1
recently	1
married,	1
they	1
met	1
as	1
good	1
friends	1
of	1
long	1
standing.	1
	1
At	1
midnight	1
dancing	1
was	1
still	1
going	1
on.	1
Helene,	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
suitable	1
partner,	1
herself	1
offered	1
to	1
dance	1
the	1
mazurka	1
with	1
Boris.	1
They	1
were	1
the	1
third	1
couple.	1
Boris,	1
coolly	1
looking	1
at	1
Helene's	1
dazzling	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
which	1
emerged	1
from	1
a	1
dark,	1
gold-embroidered,	1
gauze	1
gown,	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
old	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
unaware	1
of	1
it	1
himself	1
and	1
unnoticed	1
by	1
others,	1
never	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
ceased	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
Emperor	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
not	1
dancing,	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
doorway,	1
stopping	1
now	1
one	1
pair	1
and	1
now	1
another	1
with	1
gracious	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
alone	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
utter.	1
	1
As	1
the	1
mazurka	1
began,	1
Boris	1
saw	1
that	1
Adjutant	1
General	1
Balashev,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
closest	1
attendance	1
on	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
contrary	1
to	1
court	1
etiquette	1
stood	1
near	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
Polish	1
lady.	1
Having	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
her,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Balashev	1
and,	1
evidently	1
understanding	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
acted	1
thus	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
important	1
reasons	1
for	1
so	1
doing,	1
nodded	1
slightly	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
him.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Balashev	1
begun	1
to	1
speak	1
before	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
amazement	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
face.	1
He	1
took	1
Balashev	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
crossed	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
him,	1
unconsciously	1
clearing	1
a	1
path	1
seven	1
yards	1
wide	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
made	1
way	1
for	1
him.	1
Boris	1
noticed	1
Arakcheev's	1
excited	1
face	1
when	1
the	1
sovereign	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
Balashev.	1
Arakcheev	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brow	1
and,	1
sniffing	1
with	1
his	1
red	1
nose,	1
stepped	1
forward	1
from	1
the	1
crowd	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
address	1
him.	1
(Boris	1
understood	1
that	1
Arakcheev	1
envied	1
Balashev	1
and	1
was	1
displeased	1
that	1
evidently	1
important	1
news	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
Emperor	1
otherwise	1
than	1
through	1
himself.)	1
	1
But	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
Balashev	1
passed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
illuminated	1
garden	1
without	1
noticing	1
Arakcheev	1
who,	1
holding	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
glancing	1
wrathfully	1
around,	1
followed	1
some	1
twenty	1
paces	1
behind	1
them.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
Boris	1
was	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
the	1
mazurka,	1
he	1
was	1
worried	1
by	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
what	1
news	1
Balashev	1
had	1
brought	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
it	1
out	1
before	1
others.	1
In	1
the	1
figure	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
choose	1
two	1
ladies,	1
he	1
whispered	1
to	1
Helene	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
choose	1
Countess	1
Potocka	1
who,	1
he	1
thought,	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
veranda,	1
and	1
glided	1
over	1
the	1
parquet	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
opening	1
into	1
the	1
garden,	1
where,	1
seeing	1
Balashev	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
veranda,	1
he	1
stood	1
still.	1
They	1
were	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
door.	1
Boris,	1
fluttering	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
withdraw,	1
respectfully	1
pressed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
doorpost	1
with	1
bowed	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
with	1
the	1
agitation	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
personally	1
affronted,	1
was	1
finishing	1
with	1
these	1
words:	1
	1
"To	1
enter	1
Russia	1
without	1
declaring	1
war!	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
peace	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
armed	1
enemy	1
remains	1
in	1
my	1
country!"	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Boris	1
that	1
it	1
gave	1
the	1
Emperor	1
pleasure	1
to	1
utter	1
these	1
words.	1
He	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
form	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
expressed	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
but	1
displeased	1
that	1
Boris	1
had	1
overheard	1
it.	1
	1
"Let	1
no	1
one	1
know	1
of	1
it!"	1
the	1
Emperor	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
	1
Boris	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
meant	1
for	1
him	1
and,	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes,	1
slightly	1
bowed	1
his	1
head.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
re-entered	1
the	1
ballroom	1
and	1
remained	1
there	1
about	1
another	1
half-hour.	1
	1
Boris	1
was	1
thus	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
learn	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
Niemen	1
and,	1
thanks	1
to	1
this,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
show	1
certain	1
important	1
personages	1
that	1
much	1
that	1
was	1
concealed	1
from	1
others	1
was	1
usually	1
known	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
this	1
means	1
he	1
rose	1
higher	1
in	1
their	1
estimation.	1
	1
The	1
unexpected	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
having	1
crossed	1
the	1
Niemen	1
was	1
particularly	1
startling	1
after	1
a	1
month	1
of	1
unfulfilled	1
expectations,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
ball.	1
On	1
first	1
receiving	1
the	1
news,	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
indignation	1
and	1
resentment	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
phrase	1
that	1
pleased	1
him,	1
fully	1
expressed	1
his	1
feelings,	1
and	1
has	1
since	1
become	1
famous.	1
On	1
returning	1
home	1
at	1
two	1
o'clock	1
that	1
night	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
his	1
secretary,	1
Shishkov,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
write	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
the	1
troops	1
and	1
a	1
rescript	1
to	1
Field	1
Marshal	1
Prince	1
Saltykov,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
insisted	1
on	1
the	1
words	1
being	1
inserted	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
peace	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
armed	1
Frenchman	1
remained	1
on	1
Russian	1
soil.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
Napoleon:	1
	1
Monsieur	1
mon	1
frere,	1
	1
Yesterday	1
I	1
learned	1
that,	1
despite	1
the	1
loyalty	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
engagements	1
with	1
Your	1
Majesty,	1
your	1
troops	1
have	1
crossed	1
the	1
Russian	1
frontier,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
moment	1
received	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
a	1
note,	1
in	1
which	1
Count	1
Lauriston	1
informs	1
me,	1
as	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
aggression,	1
that	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
has	1
considered	1
yourself	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
war	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
Prince	1
Kuragin	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
passports.	1
The	1
reasons	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Duc	1
de	1
Bassano	1
based	1
his	1
refusal	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
him	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
that	1
could	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
pretext	1
for	1
aggression.	1
In	1
fact,	1
the	1
ambassador,	1
as	1
he	1
himself	1
has	1
declared,	1
was	1
never	1
authorized	1
to	1
make	1
that	1
demand,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
informed	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
disapproved	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
his	1
post.	1
If	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
does	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
our	1
peoples	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
misunderstanding,	1
and	1
consents	1
to	1
withdraw	1
your	1
troops	1
from	1
Russian	1
territory,	1
I	1
will	1
regard	1
what	1
has	1
passed	1
as	1
not	1
having	1
occurred	1
and	1
an	1
understanding	1
between	1
us	1
will	1
be	1
possible.	1
In	1
the	1
contrary	1
case,	1
Your	1
Majesty,	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
myself	1
forced	1
to	1
repel	1
an	1
attack	1
that	1
nothing	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
has	1
provoked.	1
It	1
still	1
depends	1
on	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
to	1
preserve	1
humanity	1
from	1
the	1
calamity	1
of	1
another	1
war.	1
I	1
am,	1
etc.,	1
	1
(signed)	1
Alexander.	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
At	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
of	1
June,	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
having	1
sent	1
for	1
Balashev	1
and	1
read	1
him	1
his	1
letter	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
and	1
hand	1
it	1
personally	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
Emperor.	1
When	1
dispatching	1
Balashev,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
repeated	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
peace	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
armed	1
enemy	1
remained	1
on	1
Russian	1
soil	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
transmit	1
those	1
words	1
to	1
Napoleon.	1
Alexander	1
did	1
not	1
insert	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
letter	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
because	1
with	1
his	1
characteristic	1
tact	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
injudicious	1
to	1
use	1
them	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
a	1
last	1
attempt	1
at	1
reconciliation	1
was	1
being	1
made,	1
but	1
he	1
definitely	1
instructed	1
Balashev	1
to	1
repeat	1
them	1
personally	1
to	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
Having	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
fourteenth,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
bugler	1
and	1
two	1
Cossacks,	1
Balashev	1
reached	1
the	1
French	1
outposts	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Rykonty,	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Niemen,	1
by	1
dawn.	1
There	1
he	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
French	1
cavalry	1
sentinels.	1
	1
A	1
French	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
of	1
hussars,	1
in	1
crimson	1
uniform	1
and	1
a	1
shaggy	1
cap,	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
approaching	1
Balashev	1
to	1
halt.	1
Balashev	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
at	1
once,	1
but	1
continued	1
to	1
advance	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
at	1
a	1
walking	1
pace.	1
	1
The	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
frowned	1
and,	1
muttering	1
words	1
of	1
abuse,	1
advanced	1
his	1
horse's	1
chest	1
against	1
Balashev,	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
saber,	1
and	1
shouted	1
rudely	1
at	1
the	1
Russian	1
general,	1
asking:	1
was	1
he	1
deaf	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
told?	1
Balashev	1
mentioned	1
who	1
he	1
was.	1
The	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
began	1
talking	1
with	1
his	1
comrades	1
about	1
regimental	1
matters	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Russian	1
general.	1
	1
After	1
living	1
at	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
authority	1
and	1
power,	1
after	1
conversing	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
less	1
than	1
three	1
hours	1
before,	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
being	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
respect	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
rank	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
Balashev	1
found	1
it	1
very	1
strange	1
here	1
on	1
Russian	1
soil	1
to	1
encounter	1
this	1
hostile,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
this	1
disrespectful,	1
application	1
of	1
brute	1
force	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
The	1
sun	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
appearing	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
clouds,	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
fresh	1
and	1
dewy.	1
A	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
was	1
being	1
driven	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
fields	1
the	1
larks	1
rose	1
trilling,	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
like	1
bubbles	1
rising	1
in	1
water.	1
	1
Balashev	1
looked	1
around	1
him,	1
awaiting	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
an	1
officer	1
from	1
the	1
village.	1
The	1
Russian	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
bugler	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
hussars	1
looked	1
silently	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time.	1
	1
A	1
French	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars,	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
just	1
left	1
his	1
bed,	1
came	1
riding	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
on	1
a	1
handsome	1
sleek	1
gray	1
horse,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
two	1
hussars.	1
The	1
officer,	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
their	1
horses	1
all	1
looked	1
smart	1
and	1
well	1
kept.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
that	1
first	1
period	1
of	1
a	1
campaign	1
when	1
troops	1
are	1
still	1
in	1
full	1
trim,	1
almost	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
peacetime	1
maneuvers,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
martial	1
swagger	1
in	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
the	1
gaiety	1
and	1
spirit	1
of	1
enterprise	1
which	1
always	1
accompany	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
a	1
campaign.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
colonel	1
with	1
difficulty	1
repressed	1
a	1
yawn,	1
but	1
was	1
polite	1
and	1
evidently	1
understood	1
Balashev's	1
importance.	1
He	1
led	1
him	1
past	1
his	1
soldiers	1
and	1
behind	1
the	1
outposts	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
would	1
most	1
likely	1
be	1
satisfied	1
immediately,	1
as	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
quarters	1
were,	1
he	1
believed,	1
not	1
far	1
off.	1
	1
They	1
rode	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Rykonty,	1
past	1
tethered	1
French	1
hussar	1
horses,	1
past	1
sentinels	1
and	1
men	1
who	1
saluted	1
their	1
colonel	1
and	1
stared	1
with	1
curiosity	1
at	1
a	1
Russian	1
uniform,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
village.	1
The	1
colonel	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
division	1
was	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
quarter	1
away	1
and	1
would	1
receive	1
Balashev	1
and	1
conduct	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
destination.	1
	1
The	1
sun	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
risen	1
and	1
shone	1
gaily	1
on	1
the	1
bright	1
verdure.	1
	1
They	1
had	1
hardly	1
ridden	1
up	1
a	1
hill,	1
past	1
a	1
tavern,	1
before	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
horsemen	1
coming	1
toward	1
them.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
group,	1
on	1
a	1
black	1
horse	1
with	1
trappings	1
that	1
glittered	1
in	1
the	1
sun,	1
rode	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
with	1
plumes	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
black	1
hair	1
curling	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
He	1
wore	1
a	1
red	1
mantle,	1
and	1
stretched	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
forward	1
in	1
French	1
fashion.	1
This	1
man	1
rode	1
toward	1
Balashev	1
at	1
a	1
gallop,	1
his	1
plumes	1
flowing	1
and	1
his	1
gems	1
and	1
gold	1
lace	1
glittering	1
in	1
the	1
bright	1
June	1
sunshine.	1
	1
Balashev	1
was	1
only	1
two	1
horses'	1
length	1
from	1
the	1
equestrian	1
with	1
the	1
bracelets,	1
plumes,	1
necklaces,	1
and	1
gold	1
embroidery,	1
who	1
was	1
galloping	1
toward	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
theatrically	1
solemn	1
countenance,	1
when	1
Julner,	1
the	1
French	1
colonel,	1
whispered	1
respectfully:	1
"The	1
King	1
of	1
Naples!"	1
It	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
Murat,	1
now	1
called	1
"King	1
of	1
Naples."	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
incomprehensible	1
why	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
King	1
of	1
Naples,	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
so,	1
and	1
was	1
himself	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so,	1
and	1
therefore	1
assumed	1
a	1
more	1
solemn	1
and	1
important	1
air	1
than	1
formerly.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
really	1
was	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Naples	1
that	1
when,	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
his	1
departure	1
from	1
that	1
city,	1
while	1
walking	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
some	1
Italians	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
him:	1
"Viva	1
il	1
re!"	1
*	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
a	1
pensive	1
smile	1
and	1
said:	1
"Poor	1
fellows,	1
they	1
don't	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
leaving	1
them	1
tomorrow!"	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Long	1
live	1
the	1
king."	1
	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
firmly	1
believed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
King	1
of	1
Naples	1
and	1
pitied	1
the	1
grief	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
subjects	1
he	1
was	1
abandoning,	1
latterly,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
military	1
service--and	1
especially	1
since	1
his	1
last	1
interview	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
Danzig,	1
when	1
his	1
august	1
brother-in-law	1
had	1
told	1
him:	1
"I	1
made	1
you	1
King	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
reign	1
in	1
my	1
way,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
yours!"--he	1
had	1
cheerfully	1
taken	1
up	1
his	1
familiar	1
business,	1
and--like	1
a	1
well-fed	1
but	1
not	1
overfat	1
horse	1
that	1
feels	1
himself	1
in	1
harness	1
and	1
grows	1
skittish	1
between	1
the	1
shafts--he	1
dressed	1
up	1
in	1
clothes	1
as	1
variegated	1
and	1
expensive	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
gaily	1
and	1
contentedly	1
galloped	1
along	1
the	1
roads	1
of	1
Poland,	1
without	1
himself	1
knowing	1
why	1
or	1
whither.	1
	1
On	1
seeing	1
the	1
Russian	1
general	1
he	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head,	1
with	1
its	1
long	1
hair	1
curling	1
to	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
in	1
a	1
majestically	1
royal	1
manner,	1
and	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
colonel.	1
The	1
colonel	1
respectfully	1
informed	1
His	1
Majesty	1
of	1
Balashev's	1
mission,	1
whose	1
name	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
pronounce.	1
	1
"De	1
Bal-macheve!"	1
said	1
the	1
King	1
(overcoming	1
by	1
his	1
assurance	1
the	1
difficulty	1
that	1
had	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
colonel).	1
"Charmed	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
acquaintance,	1
General!"	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
kingly	1
condescension.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
King	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
loud	1
and	1
fast	1
his	1
royal	1
dignity	1
instantly	1
forsook	1
him,	1
and	1
without	1
noticing	1
it	1
he	1
passed	1
into	1
his	1
natural	1
tone	1
of	1
good-natured	1
familiarity.	1
He	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
withers	1
of	1
Balashev's	1
horse	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"Well,	1
General,	1
it	1
all	1
looks	1
like	1
war,"	1
as	1
if	1
regretting	1
a	1
circumstance	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
judge.	1
	1
"Your	1
Majesty,"	1
replied	1
Balashev,	1
"my	1
master,	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
does	1
not	1
desire	1
war	1
and	1
as	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
sees..."	1
said	1
Balashev,	1
using	1
the	1
words	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
at	1
every	1
opportunity,	1
with	1
the	1
affectation	1
unavoidable	1
in	1
frequently	1
addressing	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
title	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
novelty.	1
	1
Murat's	1
face	1
beamed	1
with	1
stupid	1
satisfaction	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
"Monsieur	1
de	1
Bal-macheve."	1
But	1
royaute	1
oblige!	1
*	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
an	1
ally,	1
to	1
confer	1
on	1
state	1
affairs	1
with	1
Alexander's	1
envoy.	1
He	1
dismounted,	1
took	1
Balashev's	1
arm,	1
and	1
moving	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
suite,	1
which	1
waited	1
respectfully,	1
began	1
to	1
pace	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
him,	1
trying	1
to	1
speak	1
significantly.	1
He	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
resented	1
the	1
demand	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
withdraw	1
his	1
troops	1
from	1
Prussia,	1
especially	1
when	1
that	1
demand	1
became	1
generally	1
known	1
and	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
France	1
was	1
thereby	1
offended.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Royalty	1
has	1
its	1
obligations."	1
	1
Balashev	1
replied	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
"nothing	1
offensive	1
in	1
the	1
demand,	1
because..."	1
but	1
Murat	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
don't	1
consider	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
the	1
aggressor?"	1
he	1
asked	1
unexpectedly,	1
with	1
a	1
kindly	1
and	1
foolish	1
smile.	1
	1
Balashev	1
told	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
considered	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
originator	1
of	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
dear	1
general!"	1
Murat	1
again	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
"with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
wish	1
the	1
Emperors	1
may	1
arrange	1
the	1
affair	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
begun	1
by	1
no	1
wish	1
of	1
mine	1
may	1
finish	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible!"	1
said	1
he,	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
servant	1
who	1
wants	1
to	1
remain	1
good	1
friends	1
with	1
another	1
despite	1
a	1
quarrel	1
between	1
their	1
masters.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
inquiries	1
about	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
and	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
health,	1
and	1
to	1
reminiscences	1
of	1
the	1
gay	1
and	1
amusing	1
times	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
Naples.	1
Then	1
suddenly,	1
as	1
if	1
remembering	1
his	1
royal	1
dignity,	1
Murat	1
solemnly	1
drew	1
himself	1
up,	1
assumed	1
the	1
pose	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
stood	1
at	1
his	1
coronation,	1
and,	1
waving	1
his	1
right	1
arm,	1
said:	1
	1
"I	1
won't	1
detain	1
you	1
longer,	1
General.	1
I	1
wish	1
success	1
to	1
your	1
mission,"	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
embroidered	1
red	1
mantle,	1
his	1
flowing	1
feathers,	1
and	1
his	1
glittering	1
ornaments,	1
he	1
rejoined	1
his	1
suite	1
who	1
were	1
respectfully	1
awaiting	1
him.	1
	1
Balashev	1
rode	1
on,	1
supposing	1
from	1
Murat's	1
words	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
very	1
soon	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
Napoleon	1
himself.	1
But	1
instead	1
of	1
that,	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
village	1
the	1
sentinels	1
of	1
Davout's	1
infantry	1
corps	1
detained	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
pickets	1
of	1
the	1
vanguard	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
an	1
adjutant	1
of	1
the	1
corps	1
commander,	1
who	1
was	1
fetched,	1
conducted	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
Marshal	1
Davout.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
Davout	1
was	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
what	1
Arakcheev	1
was	1
to	1
Alexander--though	1
not	1
a	1
coward	1
like	1
Arakcheev,	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
precise,	1
as	1
cruel,	1
and	1
as	1
unable	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
devotion	1
to	1
his	1
monarch	1
except	1
by	1
cruelty.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
organism	1
of	1
states	1
such	1
men	1
are	1
necessary,	1
as	1
wolves	1
are	1
necessary	1
in	1
the	1
organism	1
of	1
nature,	1
and	1
they	1
always	1
exist,	1
always	1
appear	1
and	1
hold	1
their	1
own,	1
however	1
incongruous	1
their	1
presence	1
and	1
their	1
proximity	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
may	1
be.	1
This	1
inevitability	1
alone	1
can	1
explain	1
how	1
the	1
cruel	1
Arakcheev,	1
who	1
tore	1
out	1
a	1
grenadier's	1
mustache	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands,	1
whose	1
weak	1
nerves	1
rendered	1
him	1
unable	1
to	1
face	1
danger,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
neither	1
an	1
educated	1
man	1
nor	1
a	1
courtier,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
maintain	1
his	1
powerful	1
position	1
with	1
Alexander,	1
whose	1
own	1
character	1
was	1
chivalrous,	1
noble,	1
and	1
gentle.	1
	1
Balashev	1
found	1
Davout	1
seated	1
on	1
a	1
barrel	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
of	1
a	1
peasant's	1
hut,	1
writing--he	1
was	1
auditing	1
accounts.	1
Better	1
quarters	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
him,	1
but	1
Marshal	1
Davout	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
purposely	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
most	1
depressing	1
conditions	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
justification	1
for	1
being	1
gloomy.	1
For	1
the	1
same	1
reason	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
hard	1
at	1
work	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
"How	1
can	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
bright	1
side	1
of	1
life	1
when,	1
as	1
you	1
see,	1
I	1
am	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
barrel	1
and	1
working	1
in	1
a	1
dirty	1
shed?"	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
The	1
chief	1
pleasure	1
and	1
necessity	1
of	1
such	1
men,	1
when	1
they	1
encounter	1
anyone	1
who	1
shows	1
animation,	1
is	1
to	1
flaunt	1
their	1
own	1
dreary,	1
persistent	1
activity.	1
Davout	1
allowed	1
himself	1
that	1
pleasure	1
when	1
Balashev	1
was	1
brought	1
in.	1
He	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
task	1
when	1
the	1
Russian	1
general	1
entered,	1
and	1
after	1
glancing	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
at	1
Balashev's	1
face,	1
which	1
was	1
animated	1
by	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
talk	1
with	1
Murat,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
rise	1
or	1
even	1
stir,	1
but	1
scowled	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
sneered	1
malevolently.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
noticed	1
in	1
Balashev's	1
face	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
this	1
reception	1
produced,	1
Davout	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
coldly	1
asked	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
	1
Thinking	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
received	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
only	1
because	1
Davout	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
adjutant	1
general	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
and	1
even	1
his	1
envoy	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
Balashev	1
hastened	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
rank	1
and	1
mission.	1
Contrary	1
to	1
his	1
expectation,	1
Davout,	1
after	1
hearing	1
him,	1
became	1
still	1
surlier	1
and	1
ruder.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
your	1
dispatch?"	1
he	1
inquired.	1
"Give	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor."	1
	1
Balashev	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
hand	1
it	1
personally	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"Your	1
Emperor's	1
orders	1
are	1
obeyed	1
in	1
your	1
army,	1
but	1
here,"	1
said	1
Davout,	1
"you	1
must	1
do	1
as	1
you're	1
told."	1
	1
And,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
Russian	1
general	1
still	1
more	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
dependence	1
on	1
brute	1
force,	1
Davout	1
sent	1
an	1
adjutant	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
officer	1
on	1
duty.	1
	1
Balashev	1
took	1
out	1
the	1
packet	1
containing	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
letter	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
(made	1
of	1
a	1
door	1
with	1
its	1
hinges	1
still	1
hanging	1
on	1
it,	1
laid	1
across	1
two	1
barrels).	1
Davout	1
took	1
the	1
packet	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
inscription.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
perfectly	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
treat	1
me	1
with	1
respect	1
or	1
not,"	1
protested	1
Balashev,	1
"but	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
be	1
adjutant	1
general	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty...."	1
	1
Davout	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
silently	1
and	1
plainly	1
derived	1
pleasure	1
from	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
agitation	1
and	1
confusion	1
which	1
appeared	1
on	1
Balashev's	1
face.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
be	1
treated	1
as	1
is	1
fitting,"	1
said	1
he	1
and,	1
putting	1
the	1
packet	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
left	1
the	1
shed.	1
	1
A	1
minute	1
later	1
the	1
marshal's	1
adjutant,	1
de	1
Castres,	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
conducted	1
Balashev	1
to	1
the	1
quarters	1
assigned	1
him.	1
	1
That	1
day	1
he	1
dined	1
with	1
the	1
marshal,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
board	1
on	1
the	1
barrels.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Davout	1
rode	1
out	1
early	1
and,	1
after	1
asking	1
Balashev	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
peremptorily	1
requested	1
him	1
to	1
remain	1
there,	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
baggage	1
train	1
should	1
orders	1
come	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
move,	1
and	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
except	1
Monsieur	1
de	1
Castres.	1
	1
After	1
four	1
days	1
of	1
solitude,	1
ennui,	1
and	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
impotence	1
and	1
insignificance--particularly	1
acute	1
by	1
contrast	1
with	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
lately	1
moved--and	1
after	1
several	1
marches	1
with	1
the	1
marshal's	1
baggage	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
which	1
occupied	1
the	1
whole	1
district,	1
Balashev	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
Vilna--now	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
French--	1
through	1
the	1
very	1
gate	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
four	1
days	1
previously.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
imperial	1
gentleman-in-waiting,	1
the	1
Comte	1
de	1
Turenne,	1
came	1
to	1
Balashev	1
and	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon's	1
wish	1
to	1
honor	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
audience.	1
	1
Four	1
days	1
before,	1
sentinels	1
of	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
regiment	1
had	1
stood	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
which	1
Balashev	1
was	1
conducted,	1
and	1
now	1
two	1
French	1
grenadiers	1
stood	1
there	1
in	1
blue	1
uniforms	1
unfastened	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
with	1
shaggy	1
caps	1
on	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
an	1
escort	1
of	1
hussars	1
and	1
uhlans	1
and	1
a	1
brilliant	1
suite	1
of	1
aides-de-camp,	1
pages,	1
and	1
generals,	1
who	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
come	1
out,	1
were	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
porch,	1
round	1
his	1
saddle	1
horse	1
and	1
his	1
Mameluke,	1
Rustan.	1
Napoleon	1
received	1
Balashev	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
house	1
in	1
Vilna	1
from	1
which	1
Alexander	1
had	1
dispatched	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
mission.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Though	1
Balashev	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
imperial	1
pomp,	1
he	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
luxury	1
and	1
magnificence	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
court.	1
	1
The	1
Comte	1
de	1
Turenne	1
showed	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
big	1
reception	1
room	1
where	1
many	1
generals,	1
gentlemen-in-waiting,	1
and	1
Polish	1
magnates--several	1
of	1
whom	1
Balashev	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Russia--were	1
waiting.	1
Duroc	1
said	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
would	1
receive	1
the	1
Russian	1
general	1
before	1
going	1
for	1
his	1
ride.	1
	1
After	1
some	1
minutes,	1
the	1
gentleman-in-waiting	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
duty	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
great	1
reception	1
room	1
and,	1
bowing	1
politely,	1
asked	1
Balashev	1
to	1
follow	1
him.	1
	1
Balashev	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
reception	1
room,	1
one	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
study,	1
the	1
very	1
one	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
Russian	1
Emperor	1
had	1
dispatched	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
mission.	1
He	1
stood	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two,	1
waiting.	1
He	1
heard	1
hurried	1
footsteps	1
beyond	1
the	1
door,	1
both	1
halves	1
of	1
it	1
were	1
opened	1
rapidly;	1
all	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
then	1
from	1
the	1
study	1
the	1
sound	1
was	1
heard	1
of	1
other	1
steps,	1
firm	1
and	1
resolute--they	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
Napoleon.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
finished	1
dressing	1
for	1
his	1
ride,	1
and	1
wore	1
a	1
blue	1
uniform,	1
opening	1
in	1
front	1
over	1
a	1
white	1
waistcoat	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
it	1
covered	1
his	1
rotund	1
stomach,	1
white	1
leather	1
breeches	1
tightly	1
fitting	1
the	1
fat	1
thighs	1
of	1
his	1
short	1
legs,	1
and	1
Hessian	1
boots.	1
His	1
short	1
hair	1
had	1
evidently	1
just	1
been	1
brushed,	1
but	1
one	1
lock	1
hung	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
broad	1
forehead.	1
His	1
plump	1
white	1
neck	1
stood	1
out	1
sharply	1
above	1
the	1
black	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
uniform,	1
and	1
he	1
smelled	1
of	1
Eau	1
de	1
Cologne.	1
His	1
full	1
face,	1
rather	1
young-looking,	1
with	1
its	1
prominent	1
chin,	1
wore	1
a	1
gracious	1
and	1
majestic	1
expression	1
of	1
imperial	1
welcome.	1
	1
He	1
entered	1
briskly,	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
slightly	1
thrown	1
back.	1
His	1
whole	1
short	1
corpulent	1
figure	1
with	1
broad	1
thick	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
chest	1
and	1
stomach	1
involuntarily	1
protruding,	1
had	1
that	1
imposing	1
and	1
stately	1
appearance	1
one	1
sees	1
in	1
men	1
of	1
forty	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
comfort.	1
It	1
was	1
evident,	1
too,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
spirits	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
He	1
nodded	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
Balashav's	1
low	1
and	1
respectful	1
bow,	1
and	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
speaking	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
values	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
condescend	1
to	1
prepare	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
is	1
sure	1
he	1
will	1
always	1
say	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
and	1
say	1
it	1
well.	1
	1
"Good	1
day,	1
General!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
letter	1
you	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
and	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you."	1
He	1
glanced	1
with	1
his	1
large	1
eyes	1
into	1
Balashav's	1
face	1
and	1
immediately	1
looked	1
past	1
him.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
Balashev's	1
personality	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him	1
at	1
all.	1
Evidently	1
only	1
what	1
took	1
place	1
within	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
interested	1
him.	1
Nothing	1
outside	1
himself	1
had	1
any	1
significance	1
for	1
him,	1
because	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
depended	1
entirely	1
on	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not,	1
and	1
did	1
not,	1
desire	1
war,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"but	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
forced	1
on	1
me.	1
Even	1
now"	1
(he	1
emphasized	1
the	1
word)	1
"I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
receive	1
any	1
explanations	1
you	1
can	1
give	1
me."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
clearly	1
and	1
concisely	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
reasons	1
for	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
government.	1
Judging	1
by	1
the	1
calmly	1
moderate	1
and	1
amicable	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
Emperor	1
spoke,	1
Balashev	1
was	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
for	1
peace	1
and	1
intended	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
negotiations.	1
	1
When	1
Napoleon,	1
having	1
finished	1
speaking,	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
the	1
Russian	1
envoy,	1
Balashev	1
began	1
a	1
speech	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
long	1
before:	1
"Sire!	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
my	1
master..."	1
but	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes	1
bent	1
on	1
him	1
confused	1
him.	1
"You	1
are	1
flurried--compose	1
yourself!"	1
Napoleon	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Balashev's	1
uniform	1
and	1
sword.	1
	1
Balashev	1
recovered	1
himself	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
Kurakin's	1
demand	1
for	1
his	1
passports	1
a	1
sufficient	1
cause	1
for	1
war;	1
that	1
Kurakin	1
had	1
acted	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
initiative	1
and	1
without	1
his	1
sovereign's	1
assent,	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
did	1
not	1
desire	1
war,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
relations	1
with	1
England.	1
	1
"Not	1
yet!"	1
interposed	1
Napoleon,	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
fearing	1
to	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
his	1
feelings,	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
nodded	1
slightly	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
Balashev	1
might	1
proceed.	1
	1
After	1
saying	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
instructed	1
to	1
say,	1
Balashev	1
added	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
wished	1
for	1
peace,	1
but	1
would	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
negotiations	1
except	1
on	1
condition	1
that...	1
Here	1
Balashev	1
hesitated:	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
words	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
had	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
his	1
letter,	1
but	1
had	1
specially	1
inserted	1
in	1
the	1
rescript	1
to	1
Saltykov	1
and	1
had	1
told	1
Balashev	1
to	1
repeat	1
to	1
Napoleon.	1
Balashev	1
remembered	1
these	1
words,	1
"So	1
long	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
armed	1
foe	1
remains	1
on	1
Russian	1
soil,"	1
but	1
some	1
complex	1
feeling	1
restrained	1
him.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
them,	1
though	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
He	1
grew	1
confused	1
and	1
said:	1
"On	1
condition	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
retires	1
beyond	1
the	1
Niemen."	1
	1
Napoleon	1
noticed	1
Balashev's	1
embarrassment	1
when	1
uttering	1
these	1
last	1
words;	1
his	1
face	1
twitched	1
and	1
the	1
calf	1
of	1
his	1
left	1
leg	1
began	1
to	1
quiver	1
rhythmically.	1
Without	1
moving	1
from	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
he	1
began	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
louder	1
tone	1
and	1
more	1
hurriedly	1
than	1
before.	1
During	1
the	1
speech	1
that	1
followed,	1
Balashev,	1
who	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
lowered	1
his	1
eyes,	1
involuntarily	1
noticed	1
the	1
quivering	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
left	1
leg	1
which	1
increased	1
the	1
more	1
Napoleon	1
raised	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"I	1
desire	1
peace,	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,"	1
he	1
began.	1
"Have	1
I	1
not	1
for	1
eighteen	1
months	1
been	1
doing	1
everything	1
to	1
obtain	1
it?	1
I	1
have	1
waited	1
eighteen	1
months	1
for	1
explanations.	1
But	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
begin	1
negotiations,	1
what	1
is	1
demanded	1
of	1
me?"	1
he	1
said,	1
frowning	1
and	1
making	1
an	1
energetic	1
gesture	1
of	1
inquiry	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
plump	1
hand.	1
	1
"The	1
withdrawal	1
of	1
your	1
army	1
beyond	1
the	1
Niemen,	1
sire,"	1
replied	1
Balashev.	1
	1
"The	1
Niemen?"	1
repeated	1
Napoleon.	1
"So	1
now	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
retire	1
beyond	1
the	1
Niemen--only	1
the	1
Niemen?"	1
repeated	1
Napoleon,	1
looking	1
straight	1
at	1
Balashev.	1
	1
The	1
latter	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
respectfully.	1
	1
Instead	1
of	1
the	1
demand	1
of	1
four	1
months	1
earlier	1
to	1
withdraw	1
from	1
Pomerania,	1
only	1
a	1
withdrawal	1
beyond	1
the	1
Niemen	1
was	1
now	1
demanded.	1
Napoleon	1
turned	1
quickly	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
pace	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
say	1
the	1
demand	1
now	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
withdraw	1
beyond	1
the	1
Niemen	1
before	1
commencing	1
negotiations,	1
but	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
two	1
months	1
ago	1
the	1
demand	1
was	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
withdraw	1
beyond	1
the	1
Vistula	1
and	1
the	1
Oder,	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
negotiate."	1
	1
He	1
went	1
in	1
silence	1
from	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
again	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Balashev.	1
Balashev	1
noticed	1
that	1
his	1
left	1
leg	1
was	1
quivering	1
faster	1
than	1
before	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
seemed	1
petrified	1
in	1
its	1
stern	1
expression.	1
This	1
quivering	1
of	1
his	1
left	1
leg	1
was	1
a	1
thing	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
conscious	1
of.	1
"The	1
vibration	1
of	1
my	1
left	1
calf	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
sign	1
with	1
me,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
at	1
a	1
later	1
date.	1
	1
"Such	1
demands	1
as	1
to	1
retreat	1
beyond	1
the	1
Vistula	1
and	1
Oder	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
a	1
Prince	1
of	1
Baden,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
me!"	1
Napoleon	1
almost	1
screamed,	1
quite	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
surprise.	1
"If	1
you	1
gave	1
me	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
Moscow	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
accept	1
such	1
conditions.	1
You	1
say	1
I	1
have	1
begun	1
this	1
war!	1
But	1
who	1
first	1
joined	1
his	1
army?	1
The	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,	1
not	1
I!	1
And	1
you	1
offer	1
me	1
negotiations	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
expended	1
millions,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
alliance	1
with	1
England,	1
and	1
when	1
your	1
position	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
one.	1
You	1
offer	1
me	1
negotiations!	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
your	1
alliance	1
with	1
England?	1
What	1
has	1
she	1
given	1
you?"	1
he	1
continued	1
hurriedly,	1
evidently	1
no	1
longer	1
trying	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
discuss	1
its	1
possibility,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
prove	1
his	1
own	1
rectitude	1
and	1
power	1
and	1
Alexander's	1
errors	1
and	1
duplicity.	1
	1
The	1
commencement	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
had	1
obviously	1
been	1
made	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
demonstrating	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
showing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
nevertheless	1
willing	1
to	1
negotiate.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
talking,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
talked	1
the	1
less	1
could	1
he	1
control	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
The	1
whole	1
purport	1
of	1
his	1
remarks	1
now	1
was	1
evidently	1
to	1
exalt	1
himself	1
and	1
insult	1
Alexander--just	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
least	1
desired	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
interview.	1
	1
"I	1
hear	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
Turkey?"	1
	1
Balashev	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
affirmatively.	1
	1
"Peace	1
has	1
been	1
concluded..."	1
he	1
began.	1
	1
But	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
speak.	1
He	1
evidently	1
wanted	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
talking	1
himself,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
eloquence	1
and	1
unrestrained	1
irritability	1
to	1
which	1
spoiled	1
people	1
are	1
so	1
prone.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
Turks	1
without	1
obtaining	1
Moldavia	1
and	1
Wallachia;	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
your	1
sovereign	1
those	1
provinces	1
as	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
Finland.	1
Yes,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
"I	1
promised	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
Moldavia	1
and	1
Wallachia,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
won't	1
have	1
those	1
splendid	1
provinces.	1
Yet	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
united	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
empire	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
reign	1
would	1
have	1
extended	1
Russia	1
from	1
the	1
Gulf	1
of	1
Bothnia	1
to	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
the	1
Danube.	1
Catherine	1
the	1
Great	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
more,"	1
said	1
Napoleon,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
excited	1
as	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
repeating	1
to	1
Balashev	1
almost	1
the	1
very	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
to	1
Alexander	1
himself	1
at	1
Tilsit.	1
"All	1
that,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
owed	1
to	1
my	1
friendship.	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
splendid	1
reign!"	1
he	1
repeated	1
several	1
times,	1
then	1
paused,	1
drew	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox,	1
lifted	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
nose,	1
and	1
greedily	1
sniffed	1
at	1
it.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
splendid	1
reign	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
might	1
have	1
been!"	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
compassionately	1
at	1
Balashev,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
rejoinder	1
hastily	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
could	1
he	1
wish	1
or	1
look	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
obtained	1
through	1
my	1
friendship?"	1
demanded	1
Napoleon,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
in	1
perplexity.	1
"But	1
no,	1
he	1
has	1
preferred	1
to	1
surround	1
himself	1
with	1
my	1
enemies,	1
and	1
with	1
whom?	1
With	1
Steins,	1
Armfeldts,	1
Bennigsens,	1
and	1
Wintzingerodes!	1
Stein,	1
a	1
traitor	1
expelled	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
country;	1
Armfeldt,	1
a	1
rake	1
and	1
an	1
intriguer;	1
Wintzingerode,	1
a	1
fugitive	1
French	1
subject;	1
Bennigsen,	1
rather	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
soldier	1
than	1
the	1
others,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
an	1
incompetent	1
who	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
in	1
1807	1
and	1
who	1
should	1
awaken	1
terrible	1
memories	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
mind....	1
Granted	1
that	1
were	1
they	1
competent	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
use	1
of,"	1
continued	1
Napoleon--hardly	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
pace	1
in	1
words	1
with	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
thoughts	1
that	1
incessantly	1
sprang	1
up,	1
proving	1
how	1
right	1
and	1
strong	1
he	1
was	1
(in	1
his	1
perception	1
the	1
two	1
were	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same)--"but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
even	1
that!	1
They	1
are	1
neither	1
fit	1
for	1
war	1
nor	1
peace!	1
Barclay	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
capable	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
so,	1
judging	1
by	1
his	1
first	1
movements.	1
And	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
doing,	1
all	1
these	1
courtiers?	1
Pfuel	1
proposes,	1
Armfeldt	1
disputes,	1
Bennigsen	1
considers,	1
and	1
Barclay,	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
act,	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
decide	1
on,	1
and	1
time	1
passes	1
bringing	1
no	1
result.	1
Bagration	1
alone	1
is	1
a	1
military	1
man.	1
He's	1
stupid,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
experience,	1
a	1
quick	1
eye,	1
and	1
resolution....	1
And	1
what	1
role	1
is	1
your	1
young	1
monarch	1
playing	1
in	1
that	1
monstrous	1
crowd?	1
They	1
compromise	1
him	1
and	1
throw	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
responsibility	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
happens.	1
A	1
sovereign	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
unless	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
general!"	1
said	1
Napoleon,	1
evidently	1
uttering	1
these	1
words	1
as	1
a	1
direct	1
challenge	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
He	1
knew	1
how	1
Alexander	1
desired	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
military	1
commander.	1
	1
"The	1
campaign	1
began	1
only	1
a	1
week	1
ago,	1
and	1
you	1
haven't	1
even	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
defend	1
Vilna.	1
You	1
are	1
cut	1
in	1
two	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Polish	1
provinces.	1
Your	1
army	1
is	1
grumbling."	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
Your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
Balashev,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
remember	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
following	1
these	1
verbal	1
fireworks	1
with	1
difficulty,	1
"the	1
troops	1
are	1
burning	1
with	1
eagerness..."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
everything!"	1
Napoleon	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
"I	1
know	1
everything.	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
your	1
battalions	1
as	1
exactly	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
my	1
own.	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
three	1
times	1
that	1
number.	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word	1
of	1
honor,"	1
said	1
Napoleon,	1
forgetting	1
that	1
his	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
could	1
carry	1
no	1
weight--"I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
five	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
men	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Vistula.	1
The	1
Turks	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
you;	1
they	1
are	1
worth	1
nothing	1
and	1
have	1
shown	1
it	1
by	1
making	1
peace	1
with	1
you.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
Swedes--it	1
is	1
their	1
fate	1
to	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
mad	1
kings.	1
Their	1
king	1
was	1
insane	1
and	1
they	1
changed	1
him	1
for	1
another--	1
Bernadotte,	1
who	1
promptly	1
went	1
mad--for	1
no	1
Swede	1
would	1
ally	1
himself	1
with	1
Russia	1
unless	1
he	1
were	1
mad."	1
	1
Napoleon	1
grinned	1
maliciously	1
and	1
again	1
raised	1
his	1
snuffbox	1
to	1
his	1
nose.	1
	1
Balashev	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
remarks,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so;	1
he	1
continually	1
made	1
the	1
gesture	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
wishing	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
Napoleon	1
always	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
To	1
the	1
alleged	1
insanity	1
of	1
the	1
Swedes,	1
Balashev	1
wished	1
to	1
reply	1
that	1
when	1
Russia	1
is	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
Sweden	1
is	1
practically	1
an	1
island:	1
but	1
Napoleon	1
gave	1
an	1
angry	1
exclamation	1
to	1
drown	1
his	1
voice.	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
irritability	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
to	1
talk,	1
talk,	1
and	1
talk,	1
merely	1
to	1
convince	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
right.	1
Balashev	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
uncomfortable:	1
as	1
envoy	1
he	1
feared	1
to	1
demean	1
his	1
dignity	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
replying;	1
but,	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
shrank	1
before	1
the	1
transport	1
of	1
groundless	1
wrath	1
that	1
had	1
evidently	1
seized	1
Napoleon.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
now	1
uttered	1
by	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
any	1
significance,	1
and	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
would	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
them	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
senses.	1
Balashev	1
stood	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
stout	1
legs	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
do	1
I	1
care	1
about	1
your	1
allies?"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
"I	1
have	1
allies--	1
the	1
Poles.	1
There	1
are	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
fight	1
like	1
lions.	1
And	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
And	1
probably	1
still	1
more	1
perturbed	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
uttered	1
this	1
obvious	1
falsehood,	1
and	1
that	1
Balashev	1
still	1
stood	1
silently	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
attitude	1
of	1
submission	1
to	1
fate,	1
Napoleon	1
abruptly	1
turned	1
round,	1
drew	1
close	1
to	1
Balashev's	1
face,	1
and,	1
gesticulating	1
rapidly	1
and	1
energetically	1
with	1
his	1
white	1
hands,	1
almost	1
shouted:	1
	1
"Know	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
stir	1
up	1
Prussia	1
against	1
me,	1
I'll	1
wipe	1
it	1
off	1
the	1
map	1
of	1
Europe!"	1
he	1
declared,	1
his	1
face	1
pale	1
and	1
distorted	1
by	1
anger,	1
and	1
he	1
struck	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
small	1
hands	1
energetically	1
with	1
the	1
other.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
will	1
throw	1
you	1
back	1
beyond	1
the	1
Dvina	1
and	1
beyond	1
the	1
Dnieper,	1
and	1
will	1
re-	1
erect	1
against	1
you	1
that	1
barrier	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
criminal	1
and	1
blind	1
of	1
Europe	1
to	1
allow	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
will	1
happen	1
to	1
you.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
gained	1
by	1
alienating	1
me!"	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
silently	1
several	1
times	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
his	1
fat	1
shoulders	1
twitching.	1
	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
snuffbox	1
into	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
pocket,	1
took	1
it	1
out	1
again,	1
lifted	1
it	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
his	1
nose,	1
and	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Balashev.	1
He	1
paused,	1
looked	1
ironically	1
straight	1
into	1
Balashev's	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
voice:	1
	1
"And	1
yet	1
what	1
a	1
splendid	1
reign	1
your	1
master	1
might	1
have	1
had!"	1
	1
Balashev,	1
feeling	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
reply,	1
said	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
Russian	1
side	1
things	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
in	1
so	1
gloomy	1
a	1
light.	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
silent,	1
still	1
looking	1
derisively	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
evidently	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
him.	1
Balashev	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
Russia	1
the	1
best	1
results	1
were	1
expected	1
from	1
the	1
war.	1
Napoleon	1
nodded	1
condescendingly,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say,	1
"I	1
know	1
it's	1
your	1
duty	1
to	1
say	1
that,	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
believe	1
it	1
yourself.	1
I	1
have	1
convinced	1
you."	1
	1
When	1
Balashev	1
had	1
ended,	1
Napoleon	1
again	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
snuffbox,	1
sniffed	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
stamped	1
his	1
foot	1
twice	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
as	1
a	1
signal.	1
The	1
door	1
opened,	1
a	1
gentleman-in-waiting,	1
bending	1
respectfully,	1
handed	1
the	1
Emperor	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
gloves;	1
another	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
pocket	1
handkerchief.	1
Napoleon,	1
without	1
giving	1
them	1
a	1
glance,	1
turned	1
to	1
Balashev:	1
	1
"Assure	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
from	1
me,"	1
said	1
he,	1
taking	1
his	1
hat,	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
devoted	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
before:	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
thoroughly	1
and	1
very	1
highly	1
esteem	1
his	1
lofty	1
qualities.	1
I	1
will	1
detain	1
you	1
no	1
longer,	1
General;	1
you	1
shall	1
receive	1
my	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor."	1
	1
And	1
Napoleon	1
went	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
Everyone	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
rushed	1
forward	1
and	1
descended	1
the	1
staircase.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
After	1
all	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him--those	1
bursts	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
dryly	1
spoken	1
words:	1
"I	1
will	1
detain	1
you	1
no	1
longer,	1
General;	1
you	1
shall	1
receive	1
my	1
letter,"	1
Balashev	1
felt	1
convinced	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
would	1
even	1
avoid	1
another	1
meeting	1
with	1
him--an	1
insulted	1
envoy--especially	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
his	1
unseemly	1
anger.	1
But,	1
to	1
his	1
surprise,	1
Balashev	1
received,	1
through	1
Duroc,	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
Bessieres,	1
Caulaincourt,	1
and	1
Berthier	1
were	1
present	1
at	1
that	1
dinner.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
met	1
Balashev	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
amiably.	1
He	1
not	1
only	1
showed	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
constraint	1
or	1
self-reproach	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
outburst	1
that	1
morning,	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
tried	1
to	1
reassure	1
Balashev.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
mistake,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
perception	1
whatever	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
right,	1
not	1
because	1
it	1
harmonized	1
with	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong,	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
spirits	1
after	1
his	1
ride	1
through	1
Vilna,	1
where	1
crowds	1
of	1
people	1
had	1
rapturously	1
greeted	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
From	1
all	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
rode,	1
rugs,	1
flags,	1
and	1
his	1
monogram	1
were	1
displayed,	1
and	1
the	1
Polish	1
ladies,	1
welcoming	1
him,	1
waved	1
their	1
handkerchiefs	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
At	1
dinner,	1
having	1
placed	1
Balashev	1
beside	1
him,	1
Napoleon	1
not	1
only	1
treated	1
him	1
amiably	1
but	1
behaved	1
as	1
if	1
Balashev	1
were	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
courtiers,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
sympathized	1
with	1
his	1
plans	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
rejoice	1
at	1
his	1
success.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
conversation	1
he	1
mentioned	1
Moscow	1
and	1
questioned	1
Balashev	1
about	1
the	1
Russian	1
capital,	1
not	1
merely	1
as	1
an	1
interested	1
traveler	1
asks	1
about	1
a	1
new	1
city	1
he	1
intends	1
to	1
visit,	1
but	1
as	1
if	1
convinced	1
that	1
Balashev,	1
as	1
a	1
Russian,	1
must	1
be	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
curiosity.	1
	1
"How	1
many	1
inhabitants	1
are	1
there	1
in	1
Moscow?	1
How	1
many	1
houses?	1
Is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
Moscow	1
is	1
called	1
'Holy	1
Moscow'?	1
How	1
many	1
churches	1
are	1
there	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
And	1
receiving	1
the	1
reply	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
churches,	1
he	1
remarked:	1
	1
"Why	1
such	1
a	1
quantity	1
of	1
churches?"	1
	1
"The	1
Russians	1
are	1
very	1
devout,"	1
replied	1
Balashev.	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
monasteries	1
and	1
churches	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
backwardness	1
of	1
a	1
people,"	1
said	1
Napoleon,	1
turning	1
to	1
Caulaincourt	1
for	1
appreciation	1
of	1
this	1
remark.	1
	1
Balashev	1
respectfully	1
ventured	1
to	1
disagree	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"Every	1
country	1
has	1
its	1
own	1
character,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"But	1
nowhere	1
in	1
Europe	1
is	1
there	1
anything	1
like	1
that,"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
Majesty's	1
pardon,"	1
returned	1
Balashev,	1
"besides	1
Russia	1
there	1
is	1
Spain,	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
also	1
many	1
churches	1
and	1
monasteries."	1
	1
This	1
reply	1
of	1
Balashev's,	1
which	1
hinted	1
at	1
the	1
recent	1
defeats	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
in	1
Spain,	1
was	1
much	1
appreciated	1
when	1
he	1
related	1
it	1
at	1
Alexander's	1
court,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
appreciated	1
at	1
Napoleon's	1
dinner,	1
where	1
it	1
passed	1
unnoticed.	1
	1
The	1
uninterested	1
and	1
perplexed	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
marshals	1
showed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
puzzled	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
Balashev's	1
tone	1
suggested.	1
"If	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
point	1
we	1
don't	1
see	1
it,	1
or	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
witty,"	1
their	1
expressions	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
So	1
little	1
was	1
his	1
rejoinder	1
appreciated	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
naively	1
asked	1
Balashev	1
through	1
what	1
towns	1
the	1
direct	1
road	1
from	1
there	1
to	1
Moscow	1
passed.	1
Balashev,	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
alert	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
dinner,	1
replied	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
"all	1
roads	1
lead	1
to	1
Rome,"	1
so	1
all	1
roads	1
lead	1
to	1
Moscow:	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
roads,	1
and	1
"among	1
them	1
the	1
road	1
through	1
Poltava,	1
which	1
Charles	1
XII	1
chose."	1
Balashev	1
involuntarily	1
flushed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
aptitude	1
of	1
this	1
reply,	1
but	1
hardly	1
had	1
he	1
uttered	1
the	1
word	1
Poltava	1
before	1
Caulaincourt	1
began	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
badness	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
Petersburg	1
reminiscences.	1
	1
After	1
dinner	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
drink	1
coffee	1
in	1
Napoleon's	1
study,	1
which	1
four	1
days	1
previously	1
had	1
been	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander.	1
Napoleon	1
sat	1
down,	1
toying	1
with	1
his	1
Sevres	1
coffee	1
cup,	1
and	1
motioned	1
Balashev	1
to	1
a	1
chair	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
well-known	1
after-dinner	1
mood	1
which,	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
reasoned	1
cause,	1
makes	1
a	1
man	1
contented	1
with	1
himself	1
and	1
disposed	1
to	1
consider	1
everyone	1
his	1
friend.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
men	1
who	1
adored	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
convinced	1
that,	1
after	1
his	1
dinner,	1
Balashev	1
too	1
was	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
worshiper.	1
Napoleon	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant,	1
though	1
slightly	1
ironic,	1
smile.	1
	1
"They	1
tell	1
me	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
occupied?	1
Strange,	1
isn't	1
it,	1
General?"	1
he	1
said,	1
evidently	1
not	1
doubting	1
that	1
this	1
remark	1
would	1
be	1
agreeable	1
to	1
his	1
hearer	1
since	1
it	1
went	1
to	1
prove	1
his,	1
Napoleon's,	1
superiority	1
to	1
Alexander.	1
	1
Balashev	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"Yes.	1
Four	1
days	1
ago	1
in	1
this	1
room,	1
Wintzingerode	1
and	1
Stein	1
were	1
deliberating,"	1
continued	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
derisive	1
and	1
self-	1
confident	1
smile.	1
"What	1
I	1
can't	1
understand,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
"is	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
has	1
surrounded	1
himself	1
with	1
my	1
personal	1
enemies.	1
That	1
I	1
do	1
not...	1
understand.	1
Has	1
he	1
not	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
do	1
the	1
same?"	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
inquiringly	1
to	1
Balashev,	1
and	1
evidently	1
this	1
thought	1
turned	1
him	1
back	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
track	1
of	1
his	1
morning's	1
anger,	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
fresh	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
so!"	1
said	1
Napoleon,	1
rising	1
and	1
pushing	1
his	1
cup	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
"I'll	1
drive	1
all	1
his	1
Wurttemberg,	1
Baden,	1
and	1
Weimar	1
relations	1
out	1
of	1
Germany....	1
Yes.	1
I'll	1
drive	1
them	1
out.	1
Let	1
him	1
prepare	1
an	1
asylum	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
Russia!"	1
	1
Balashev	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
indicating	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
bow	1
and	1
leave,	1
and	1
only	1
listened	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
hearing	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him.	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
this	1
expression;	1
he	1
treated	1
Balashev	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
envoy	1
from	1
his	1
enemy,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
now	1
fully	1
devoted	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
who	1
must	1
rejoice	1
at	1
his	1
former	1
master's	1
humiliation.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
has	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
taken	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
armies?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
that?	1
War	1
is	1
my	1
profession,	1
but	1
his	1
business	1
is	1
to	1
reign	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
command	1
armies!	1
Why	1
has	1
he	1
taken	1
on	1
himself	1
such	1
a	1
responsibility?"	1
	1
Again	1
Napoleon	1
brought	1
out	1
his	1
snuffbox,	1
paced	1
several	1
times	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
then,	1
suddenly	1
and	1
unexpectedly,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Balashev	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile,	1
as	1
confidently,	1
quickly,	1
and	1
simply	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
doing	1
something	1
not	1
merely	1
important	1
but	1
pleasing	1
to	1
Balashev,	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
forty-year-old	1
Russian	1
general's	1
face	1
and,	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
ear,	1
pulled	1
it	1
gently,	1
smiling	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
only.	1
	1
To	1
have	1
one's	1
ear	1
pulled	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
considered	1
the	1
greatest	1
honor	1
and	1
mark	1
of	1
favor	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
court.	1
	1
"Well,	1
adorer	1
and	1
courtier	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
say	1
anything?"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
ridiculous,	1
in	1
his	1
presence,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
adorer	1
and	1
courtier	1
of	1
anyone	1
but	1
himself,	1
Napoleon.	1
"Are	1
the	1
horses	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
general?"	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
inclination	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
Balashev's	1
bow.	1
"Let	1
him	1
have	1
mine,	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
to	1
go!"	1
	1
The	1
letter	1
taken	1
by	1
Balashev	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
Napoleon	1
sent	1
to	1
Alexander.	1
Every	1
detail	1
of	1
the	1
interview	1
was	1
communicated	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
monarch,	1
and	1
the	1
war	1
began...	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
After	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Pierre	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
on	1
business	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
family,	1
but	1
really	1
to	1
meet	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
whom	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
encounter.	1
On	1
reaching	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
inquired	1
for	1
Kuragin	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
already	1
left	1
the	1
city.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
warned	1
his	1
brother-in-law	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
track.	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
promptly	1
obtained	1
an	1
appointment	1
from	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army	1
in	1
Moldavia.	1
While	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
met	1
Kutuzov,	1
his	1
former	1
commander	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
well	1
disposed	1
toward	1
him,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
suggested	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
accompany	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
in	1
Moldavia,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
general	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
commander-in-chief.	1
So	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
having	1
received	1
an	1
appointment	1
on	1
the	1
headquarters	1
staff,	1
left	1
for	1
Turkey.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
write	1
and	1
challenge	1
Kuragin.	1
He	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
challenged	1
him	1
without	1
some	1
fresh	1
cause	1
it	1
might	1
compromise	1
the	1
young	1
Countess	1
Rostova	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
meet	1
Kuragin	1
personally	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
fresh	1
pretext	1
for	1
a	1
duel.	1
But	1
he	1
again	1
failed	1
to	1
meet	1
Kuragin	1
in	1
Turkey,	1
for	1
soon	1
after	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
arrived,	1
the	1
latter	1
returned	1
to	1
Russia.	1
In	1
a	1
new	1
country,	1
amid	1
new	1
conditions,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
found	1
life	1
easier	1
to	1
bear.	1
After	1
his	1
betrothed	1
had	1
broken	1
faith	1
with	1
him--which	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
more	1
acutely	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal	1
its	1
effects--the	1
surroundings	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
happy	1
became	1
trying	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
freedom	1
and	1
independence	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
prized	1
so	1
highly	1
were	1
still	1
more	1
so.	1
Not	1
only	1
could	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
think	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
first	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
and	1
had	1
later	1
enlarged	1
upon	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
filled	1
his	1
solitude	1
at	1
Bogucharovo	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
Switzerland	1
and	1
Rome,	1
but	1
he	1
even	1
dreaded	1
to	1
recall	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
bright	1
and	1
boundless	1
horizons	1
they	1
had	1
revealed.	1
He	1
was	1
now	1
concerned	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
nearest	1
practical	1
matters	1
unrelated	1
to	1
his	1
past	1
interests,	1
and	1
he	1
seized	1
on	1
these	1
the	1
more	1
eagerly	1
the	1
more	1
those	1
past	1
interests	1
were	1
closed	1
to	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
lofty,	1
infinite	1
canopy	1
of	1
heaven	1
that	1
had	1
once	1
towered	1
above	1
him	1
had	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
low,	1
solid	1
vault	1
that	1
weighed	1
him	1
down,	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
was	1
clear,	1
but	1
nothing	1
eternal	1
or	1
mysterious.	1
	1
Of	1
the	1
activities	1
that	1
presented	1
themselves	1
to	1
him,	1
army	1
service	1
was	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
familiar.	1
As	1
a	1
general	1
on	1
duty	1
on	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff,	1
he	1
applied	1
himself	1
to	1
business	1
with	1
zeal	1
and	1
perseverance	1
and	1
surprised	1
Kutuzov	1
by	1
his	1
willingness	1
and	1
accuracy	1
in	1
work.	1
Not	1
having	1
found	1
Kuragin	1
in	1
Turkey,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
rush	1
back	1
to	1
Russia	1
after	1
him,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
however	1
long	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
before	1
he	1
met	1
Kuragin,	1
despite	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
despite	1
all	1
the	1
proofs	1
he	1
deduced	1
to	1
convince	1
himself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
worth	1
stooping	1
to	1
a	1
conflict	1
with	1
him--he	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
meet	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
resist	1
calling	1
him	1
out,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
ravenous	1
man	1
can	1
help	1
snatching	1
at	1
food.	1
And	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
the	1
insult	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
avenged,	1
that	1
his	1
rancor	1
was	1
still	1
unspent,	1
weighed	1
on	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
poisoned	1
the	1
artificial	1
tranquillity	1
which	1
he	1
managed	1
to	1
obtain	1
in	1
Turkey	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
restless,	1
plodding,	1
and	1
rather	1
vainglorious	1
and	1
ambitious	1
activity.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
1812,	1
when	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
reached	1
Bucharest--	1
where	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
for	1
two	1
months,	1
passing	1
his	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
with	1
a	1
Wallachian	1
woman--Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
transfer	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Western	1
Army.	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
weary	1
of	1
Bolkonski's	1
activity	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
reproach	1
his	1
own	1
idleness,	1
very	1
readily	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
mission	1
to	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly.	1
	1
Before	1
joining	1
the	1
Western	1
Army	1
which	1
was	1
then,	1
in	1
May,	1
encamped	1
at	1
Drissa,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
visited	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
which	1
was	1
directly	1
on	1
his	1
way,	1
being	1
only	1
two	1
miles	1
off	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
highroad.	1
During	1
the	1
last	1
three	1
years	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
many	1
changes	1
in	1
his	1
life,	1
he	1
had	1
thought,	1
felt,	1
and	1
seen	1
so	1
much	1
(having	1
traveled	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
the	1
west),	1
that	1
on	1
reaching	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
it	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
strange	1
and	1
unexpected	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
there	1
unchanged	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
every	1
detail.	1
He	1
entered	1
through	1
the	1
gates	1
with	1
their	1
stone	1
pillars	1
and	1
drove	1
up	1
the	1
avenue	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
entering	1
an	1
enchanted,	1
sleeping	1
castle.	1
The	1
same	1
old	1
stateliness,	1
the	1
same	1
cleanliness,	1
the	1
same	1
stillness	1
reigned	1
there,	1
and	1
inside	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
furniture,	1
the	1
same	1
walls,	1
sounds,	1
and	1
smell,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
timid	1
faces,	1
only	1
somewhat	1
older.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
timid,	1
plain	1
maiden	1
getting	1
on	1
in	1
years,	1
uselessly	1
and	1
joylessly	1
passing	1
the	1
best	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
in	1
fear	1
and	1
constant	1
suffering.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
coquettish,	1
self-satisfied	1
girl,	1
enjoying	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
joyous	1
hopes	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
She	1
had	1
merely	1
become	1
more	1
self-confident,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
thought.	1
Dessalles,	1
the	1
tutor	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
Switzerland,	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
Russian	1
cut	1
and	1
talking	1
broken	1
Russian	1
to	1
the	1
servants,	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
narrowly	1
intelligent,	1
conscientious,	1
and	1
pedantic	1
preceptor.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
changed	1
in	1
appearance	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
tooth,	1
which	1
left	1
a	1
noticeable	1
gap	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
mouth;	1
in	1
character	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
ever,	1
only	1
showing	1
still	1
more	1
irritability	1
and	1
skepticism	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Little	1
Nicholas	1
alone	1
had	1
changed.	1
He	1
had	1
grown,	1
become	1
rosier,	1
had	1
curly	1
dark	1
hair,	1
and,	1
when	1
merry	1
and	1
laughing,	1
quite	1
unconsciously	1
lifted	1
the	1
upper	1
lip	1
of	1
his	1
pretty	1
little	1
mouth	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
used	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
alone	1
did	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
immutability	1
in	1
the	1
enchanted,	1
sleeping	1
castle.	1
But	1
though	1
externally	1
all	1
remained	1
as	1
of	1
old,	1
the	1
inner	1
relations	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
last.	1
The	1
household	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
alien	1
and	1
hostile	1
camps,	1
who	1
changed	1
their	1
habits	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
and	1
only	1
met	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
there.	1
To	1
the	1
one	1
camp	1
belonged	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
and	1
the	1
architect;	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
Dessalles,	1
little	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
nurses	1
and	1
maids.	1
	1
During	1
his	1
stay	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
all	1
the	1
family	1
dined	1
together,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
visitor	1
for	1
whose	1
sake	1
an	1
exception	1
was	1
being	1
made	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
presence	1
made	1
them	1
all	1
feel	1
awkward.	1
Involuntarily	1
feeling	1
this	1
at	1
dinner	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day,	1
he	1
was	1
taciturn,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
noticing	1
this	1
also	1
became	1
morosely	1
dumb	1
and	1
retired	1
to	1
his	1
apartments	1
directly	1
after	1
dinner.	1
In	1
the	1
evening,	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
trying	1
to	1
rouse	1
him,	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
Count	1
Kamensky's	1
campaign,	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
began	1
unexpectedly	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
blaming	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
superstitions	1
and	1
her	1
dislike	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
who,	1
he	1
said,	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
really	1
attached	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
ill	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
because	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary:	1
that	1
she	1
purposely	1
worried	1
and	1
irritated	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
indulgence	1
and	1
silly	1
talk	1
she	1
was	1
spoiling	1
little	1
Prince	1
Nicholas.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
he	1
tormented	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
very	1
hard,	1
but	1
he	1
also	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
tormenting	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
deserved	1
it.	1
"Why	1
does	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
sees	1
this,	1
say	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
about	1
his	1
sister?	1
Does	1
he	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
scoundrel,	1
or	1
an	1
old	1
fool	1
who,	1
without	1
any	1
reason,	1
keeps	1
his	1
own	1
daughter	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
and	1
attaches	1
this	1
Frenchwoman	1
to	1
himself?	1
He	1
doesn't	1
understand,	1
so	1
I	1
must	1
explain	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
hear	1
me	1
out,"	1
thought	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
why	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
daughter's	1
unreasonable	1
character.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
ask	1
me,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
without	1
looking	1
up	1
(he	1
was	1
censuring	1
his	1
father	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life),	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
it,	1
but	1
as	1
you	1
ask	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
frank	1
opinion.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
misunderstanding	1
and	1
discord	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
Mary,	1
I	1
can't	1
blame	1
her	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
she	1
loves	1
and	1
respects	1
you.	1
Since	1
you	1
ask	1
me,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
becoming	1
irritable--as	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
liable	1
to	1
do	1
of	1
late--"I	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
any	1
misunderstandings	1
they	1
are	1
caused	1
by	1
that	1
worthless	1
woman,	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
sister's	1
companion."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
first	1
stared	1
fixedly	1
at	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
an	1
unnatural	1
smile	1
disclosed	1
the	1
fresh	1
gap	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
to	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
accustomed.	1
	1
"What	1
companion,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy?	1
Eh?	1
You've	1
already	1
been	1
talking	1
it	1
over!	1
Eh?"	1
	1
"Father,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
judge,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
in	1
a	1
hard	1
and	1
bitter	1
tone,	1
"but	1
you	1
challenged	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
and	1
always	1
shall	1
say,	1
that	1
Mary	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
blame,	1
but	1
those	1
to	1
blame--the	1
one	1
to	1
blame--is	1
that	1
Frenchwoman."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
he	1
has	1
passed	1
judgment...	1
passed	1
judgement!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
some	1
embarrassment,	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
cried:	1
"Be	1
off,	1
be	1
off!	1
Let	1
not	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
you	1
remain	1
here!..."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
wished	1
to	1
leave	1
at	1
once,	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
stay	1
another	1
day.	1
That	1
day	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
his	1
father,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
admitted	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
Tikhon,	1
but	1
asked	1
several	1
times	1
whether	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
gone.	1
Next	1
day,	1
before	1
leaving,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
son's	1
rooms.	1
The	1
boy,	1
curly-	1
headed	1
like	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
glowing	1
with	1
health,	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
knee,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Bluebeard,	1
but	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
reverie	1
without	1
finishing	1
the	1
story.	1
He	1
thought	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
pretty	1
child,	1
his	1
son	1
whom	1
he	1
held	1
on	1
his	1
knee,	1
but	1
of	1
himself.	1
He	1
sought	1
in	1
himself	1
either	1
remorse	1
for	1
having	1
angered	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
regret	1
at	1
leaving	1
home	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
on	1
bad	1
terms	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
horrified	1
to	1
find	1
neither.	1
What	1
meant	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
sought	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
in	1
himself	1
the	1
former	1
tenderness	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
reawaken	1
by	1
caressing	1
the	1
boy	1
and	1
taking	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
knee.	1
	1
"Well,	1
go	1
on!"	1
said	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
without	1
replying,	1
put	1
him	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
knee	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
his	1
daily	1
occupations,	1
and	1
especially	1
on	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
amid	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
happy,	1
weariness	1
of	1
life	1
overcame	1
him	1
with	1
its	1
former	1
intensity,	1
and	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
these	1
memories	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
work	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
"So	1
you've	1
decided	1
to	1
go,	1
Andrew?"	1
asked	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
can,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
you	1
can't."	1
	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
that?"	1
replied	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
that,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
this	1
terrible	1
war,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
old?	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
says	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
asking	1
about	1
you...."	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
that,	1
her	1
lips	1
trembled	1
and	1
her	1
tears	1
began	1
to	1
fall.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
began	1
pacing	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
God!	1
my	1
God!	1
When	1
one	1
thinks	1
who	1
and	1
what--what	1
trash--can	1
cause	1
people	1
misery!"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
malignity	1
that	1
alarmed	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
She	1
understood	1
that	1
when	1
speaking	1
of	1
"trash"	1
he	1
referred	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
misery,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
ruined	1
his	1
own	1
happiness.	1
	1
"Andrew!	1
One	1
thing	1
I	1
beg,	1
I	1
entreat	1
of	1
you!"	1
she	1
said,	1
touching	1
his	1
elbow	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
shone	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
"I	1
understand	1
you"	1
(she	1
looked	1
down).	1
"Don't	1
imagine	1
that	1
sorrow	1
is	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
men.	1
Men	1
are	1
His	1
tools."	1
She	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
above	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
confident,	1
accustomed	1
look	1
with	1
which	1
one	1
looks	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
a	1
familiar	1
portrait	1
hangs.	1
"Sorrow	1
is	1
sent	1
by	1
Him,	1
not	1
by	1
men.	1
Men	1
are	1
His	1
instruments,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
blame.	1
If	1
you	1
think	1
someone	1
has	1
wronged	1
you,	1
forget	1
it	1
and	1
forgive!	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
punish.	1
And	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
forgiving."	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
were	1
a	1
woman	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
so,	1
Mary.	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
woman's	1
virtue.	1
But	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
forgive	1
and	1
forget,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
and	1
though	1
till	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
Kuragin,	1
all	1
his	1
unexpended	1
anger	1
suddenly	1
swelled	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
"If	1
Mary	1
is	1
already	1
persuading	1
me	1
to	1
forgive,	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
have	1
punished	1
him,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
And	1
giving	1
her	1
no	1
further	1
reply,	1
he	1
began	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
glad	1
vindictive	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
meet	1
Kuragin	1
who	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
army.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
stay	1
one	1
day	1
more,	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
how	1
unhappy	1
her	1
father	1
would	1
be	1
if	1
Andrew	1
left	1
without	1
being	1
reconciled	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
probably	1
soon	1
be	1
back	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
would	1
certainly	1
write	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
longer	1
he	1
stayed	1
now	1
the	1
more	1
embittered	1
their	1
differences	1
would	1
become.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
Andrew!	1
Remember	1
that	1
misfortunes	1
come	1
from	1
God,	1
and	1
men	1
are	1
never	1
to	1
blame,"	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
sister	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
"Then	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so!"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
as	1
he	1
drove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
"She,	1
poor	1
innocent	1
creature,	1
is	1
left	1
to	1
be	1
victimized	1
by	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
outlived	1
his	1
wits.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
feels	1
he	1
is	1
guilty,	1
but	1
cannot	1
change	1
himself.	1
My	1
boy	1
is	1
growing	1
up	1
and	1
rejoices	1
in	1
life,	1
in	1
which	1
like	1
everybody	1
else	1
he	1
will	1
deceive	1
or	1
be	1
deceived.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
army.	1
Why?	1
I	1
myself	1
don't	1
know.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
meet	1
that	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
despise,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
kill	1
and	1
laugh	1
at	1
me!"	1
	1
These	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
same	1
before,	1
but	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
connected,	1
while	1
now	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
tumbled	1
to	1
pieces.	1
Only	1
senseless	1
things,	1
lacking	1
coherence,	1
presented	1
themselves	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
mind.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
reached	1
the	1
general	1
headquarters	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
June.	1
The	1
first	1
army,	1
with	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
occupied	1
the	1
fortified	1
camp	1
at	1
Drissa;	1
the	1
second	1
army	1
was	1
retreating,	1
trying	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
junction	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
one	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
by	1
large	1
French	1
forces.	1
Everyone	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
affairs	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
anticipated	1
any	1
danger	1
of	1
invasion	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
provinces,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
thought	1
the	1
war	1
would	1
extend	1
farther	1
than	1
the	1
western,	1
the	1
Polish,	1
provinces.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
found	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
assigned,	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Drissa.	1
As	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
town	1
or	1
large	1
village	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
the	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
generals	1
and	1
courtiers	1
accompanying	1
the	1
army	1
were	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
villages	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
over	1
a	1
radius	1
of	1
six	1
miles.	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly	1
was	1
quartered	1
nearly	1
three	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
He	1
received	1
Bolkonski	1
stiffly	1
and	1
coldly	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
foreign	1
accent	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
mention	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
for	1
a	1
decision	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
employment,	1
but	1
asked	1
him	1
meanwhile	1
to	1
remain	1
on	1
his	1
staff.	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin,	1
whom	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
find	1
with	1
the	1
army,	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
He	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
this.	1
His	1
mind	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
center	1
that	1
was	1
conducting	1
a	1
gigantic	1
war,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
from	1
the	1
distraction	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
Kuragin.	1
During	1
the	1
first	1
four	1
days,	1
while	1
no	1
duties	1
were	1
required	1
of	1
him,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rode	1
round	1
the	1
whole	1
fortified	1
camp	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
knowledge	1
and	1
by	1
talks	1
with	1
experts,	1
tried	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
definite	1
opinion	1
about	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
the	1
camp	1
was	1
advantageous	1
or	1
disadvantageous	1
remained	1
for	1
him	1
undecided.	1
Already	1
from	1
his	1
military	1
experience	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
Austrian	1
campaign,	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
in	1
war	1
the	1
most	1
deeply	1
considered	1
plans	1
have	1
no	1
significance	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
unexpected	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
enemy--that	1
cannot	1
be	1
foreseen--are	1
met,	1
and	1
on	1
how	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
is	1
handled.	1
To	1
clear	1
up	1
this	1
last	1
point	1
for	1
himself,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
utilizing	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
acquaintances,	1
tried	1
to	1
fathom	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
parties	1
engaged	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
deduced	1
for	1
himself	1
the	1
following	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
affairs.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
still	1
been	1
at	1
Vilna,	1
the	1
forces	1
had	1
been	1
divided	1
into	1
three	1
armies.	1
First,	1
the	1
army	1
under	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly,	1
secondly,	1
the	1
army	1
under	1
Bagration,	1
and	1
thirdly,	1
the	1
one	1
commanded	1
by	1
Tormasov.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
army,	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
commander-in-chief.	1
In	1
the	1
orders	1
issued	1
it	1
was	1
stated,	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
would	1
take	1
command,	1
but	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
army.	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
moreover,	1
had	1
with	1
him	1
not	1
a	1
commander-in-chief's	1
staff	1
but	1
the	1
imperial	1
headquarters	1
staff.	1
In	1
attendance	1
on	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
imperial	1
staff,	1
Quartermaster	1
General	1
Prince	1
Volkonski,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
generals,	1
imperial	1
aides-de-camp,	1
diplomatic	1
officials,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
foreigners,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
army	1
staff.	1
Besides	1
these,	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
the	1
Emperor	1
without	1
any	1
definite	1
appointments:	1
Arakcheev,	1
the	1
ex-Minister	1
of	1
War;	1
Count	1
Bennigsen,	1
the	1
senior	1
general	1
in	1
rank;	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
Tsarevich	1
Constantine	1
Pavlovich;	1
Count	1
Rumyantsev,	1
the	1
Chancellor;	1
Stein,	1
a	1
former	1
Prussian	1
minister;	1
Armfeldt,	1
a	1
Swedish	1
general;	1
Pfuel,	1
the	1
chief	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign;	1
Paulucci,	1
an	1
adjutant	1
general	1
and	1
Sardinian	1
emigre;	1
Wolzogen--and	1
many	1
others.	1
Though	1
these	1
men	1
had	1
no	1
military	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
army,	1
their	1
position	1
gave	1
them	1
influence,	1
and	1
often	1
a	1
corps	1
commander,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
in	1
what	1
capacity	1
he	1
was	1
questioned	1
by	1
Bennigsen,	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke,	1
Arakcheev,	1
or	1
Prince	1
Volkonski,	1
or	1
was	1
given	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
advice	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
a	1
certain	1
order	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
advice	1
emanated	1
from	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
gave	1
it	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
executed	1
or	1
not.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
external	1
condition;	1
the	1
essential	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
people,	1
from	1
a	1
courtier's	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
(and	1
in	1
an	1
Emperor's	1
vicinity	1
all	1
became	1
courtiers),	1
was	1
clear	1
to	1
everyone.	1
It	1
was	1
this:	1
the	1
Emperor	1
did	1
not	1
assume	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
commander-in-chief,	1
but	1
disposed	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
armies;	1
the	1
men	1
around	1
him	1
were	1
his	1
assistants.	1
Arakcheev	1
was	1
a	1
faithful	1
custodian	1
to	1
enforce	1
order	1
and	1
acted	1
as	1
the	1
sovereign's	1
bodyguard.	1
Bennigsen	1
was	1
a	1
landlord	1
in	1
the	1
Vilna	1
province	1
who	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
the	1
honors	1
of	1
the	1
district,	1
but	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
a	1
good	1
general,	1
useful	1
as	1
an	1
adviser	1
and	1
ready	1
at	1
hand	1
to	1
replace	1
Barclay.	1
The	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
was	1
there	1
because	1
it	1
suited	1
him	1
to	1
be.	1
The	1
ex-Minister	1
Stein	1
was	1
there	1
because	1
his	1
advice	1
was	1
useful	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
held	1
him	1
in	1
high	1
esteem	1
personally.	1
Armfeldt	1
virulently	1
hated	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
full	1
of	1
self-confidence,	1
a	1
quality	1
that	1
always	1
influenced	1
Alexander.	1
Paulucci	1
was	1
there	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
bold	1
and	1
decided	1
in	1
speech.	1
The	1
adjutants	1
general	1
were	1
there	1
because	1
they	1
always	1
accompanied	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
lastly	1
and	1
chiefly	1
Pfuel	1
was	1
there	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
drawn	1
up	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign	1
against	1
Napoleon	1
and,	1
having	1
induced	1
Alexander	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
that	1
plan,	1
was	1
directing	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
war.	1
With	1
Pfuel	1
was	1
Wolzogen,	1
who	1
expressed	1
Pfuel's	1
thoughts	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
comprehensible	1
way	1
than	1
Pfuel	1
himself	1
(who	1
was	1
a	1
harsh,	1
bookish	1
theorist,	1
self-confident	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
despising	1
everyone	1
else)	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
Besides	1
these	1
Russians	1
and	1
foreigners	1
who	1
propounded	1
new	1
and	1
unexpected	1
ideas	1
every	1
day--especially	1
the	1
foreigners,	1
who	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
a	1
boldness	1
characteristic	1
of	1
people	1
employed	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
not	1
their	1
own--there	1
were	1
many	1
secondary	1
personages	1
accompanying	1
the	1
army	1
because	1
their	1
principals	1
were	1
there.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
opinions	1
and	1
voices	1
in	1
this	1
immense,	1
restless,	1
brilliant,	1
and	1
proud	1
sphere,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
noticed	1
the	1
following	1
sharply	1
defined	1
subdivisions	1
of	1
tendencies	1
and	1
parties:	1
	1
The	1
first	1
party	1
consisted	1
of	1
Pfuel	1
and	1
his	1
adherents--military	1
theorists	1
who	1
believed	1
in	1
a	1
science	1
of	1
war	1
with	1
immutable	1
laws--laws	1
of	1
oblique	1
movements,	1
outflankings,	1
and	1
so	1
forth.	1
Pfuel	1
and	1
his	1
adherents	1
demanded	1
a	1
retirement	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
precise	1
laws	1
defined	1
by	1
a	1
pseudo-theory	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
only	1
barbarism,	1
ignorance,	1
or	1
evil	1
intention	1
in	1
every	1
deviation	1
from	1
that	1
theory.	1
To	1
this	1
party	1
belonged	1
the	1
foreign	1
nobles,	1
Wolzogen,	1
Wintzingerode,	1
and	1
others,	1
chiefly	1
Germans.	1
	1
The	1
second	1
party	1
was	1
directly	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
first;	1
one	1
extreme,	1
as	1
always	1
happens,	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
this	1
party	1
were	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
demanded	1
an	1
advance	1
from	1
Vilna	1
into	1
Poland	1
and	1
freedom	1
from	1
all	1
prearranged	1
plans.	1
Besides	1
being	1
advocates	1
of	1
bold	1
action,	1
this	1
section	1
also	1
represented	1
nationalism,	1
which	1
made	1
them	1
still	1
more	1
one-sided	1
in	1
the	1
dispute.	1
They	1
were	1
Russians:	1
Bagration,	1
Ermolov	1
(who	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
front),	1
and	1
others.	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
a	1
famous	1
joke	1
of	1
Ermolov's	1
was	1
being	1
circulated,	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
favor	1
he	1
had	1
petitioned	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
German.	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
party,	1
remembering	1
Suvorov,	1
said	1
that	1
what	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
reason,	1
or	1
stick	1
pins	1
into	1
maps,	1
but	1
to	1
fight,	1
beat	1
the	1
enemy,	1
keep	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
Russia,	1
and	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
army	1
get	1
discouraged.	1
	1
To	1
the	1
third	1
party--in	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
most	1
confidence--belonged	1
the	1
courtiers	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
arrange	1
compromises	1
between	1
the	1
other	1
two.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
this	1
party,	1
chiefly	1
civilians	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
Arakcheev	1
belonged,	1
thought	1
and	1
said	1
what	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
no	1
convictions	1
but	1
wish	1
to	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
generally	1
say.	1
They	1
said	1
that	1
undoubtedly	1
war,	1
particularly	1
against	1
such	1
a	1
genius	1
as	1
Bonaparte	1
(they	1
called	1
him	1
Bonaparte	1
now),	1
needs	1
most	1
deeply	1
devised	1
plans	1
and	1
profound	1
scientific	1
knowledge	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
Pfuel	1
was	1
a	1
genius,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
acknowledged	1
that	1
the	1
theorists	1
are	1
often	1
one-sided,	1
and	1
therefore	1
one	1
should	1
not	1
trust	1
them	1
absolutely,	1
but	1
should	1
also	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
Pfuel's	1
opponents	1
and	1
practical	1
men	1
of	1
experience	1
in	1
warfare	1
had	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
then	1
choose	1
a	1
middle	1
course.	1
They	1
insisted	1
on	1
the	1
retention	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
at	1
Drissa,	1
according	1
to	1
Pfuel's	1
plan,	1
but	1
on	1
changing	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
armies.	1
Though,	1
by	1
this	1
course,	1
neither	1
one	1
aim	1
nor	1
the	1
other	1
could	1
be	1
attained,	1
yet	1
it	1
seemed	1
best	1
to	1
the	1
adherents	1
of	1
this	1
third	1
party.	1
	1
Of	1
a	1
fourth	1
opinion	1
the	1
most	1
conspicuous	1
representative	1
was	1
the	1
Tsarevich,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
forget	1
his	1
disillusionment	1
at	1
Austerlitz,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
ridden	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Guards,	1
in	1
his	1
casque	1
and	1
cavalry	1
uniform	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
review,	1
expecting	1
to	1
crush	1
the	1
French	1
gallantly;	1
but	1
unexpectedly	1
finding	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line	1
had	1
narrowly	1
escaped	1
amid	1
the	1
general	1
confusion.	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
party	1
had	1
both	1
the	1
quality	1
and	1
the	1
defect	1
of	1
frankness	1
in	1
their	1
opinions.	1
They	1
feared	1
Napoleon,	1
recognized	1
his	1
strength	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
weakness,	1
and	1
frankly	1
said	1
so.	1
They	1
said:	1
"Nothing	1
but	1
sorrow,	1
shame,	1
and	1
ruin	1
will	1
come	1
of	1
all	1
this!	1
We	1
have	1
abandoned	1
Vilna	1
and	1
Vitebsk	1
and	1
shall	1
abandon	1
Drissa.	1
The	1
only	1
reasonable	1
thing	1
left	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
conclude	1
peace	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible,	1
before	1
we	1
are	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
Petersburg."	1
	1
This	1
view	1
was	1
very	1
general	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
army	1
circles	1
and	1
found	1
support	1
also	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
chancellor,	1
Rumyantsev,	1
who,	1
for	1
other	1
reasons	1
of	1
state,	1
was	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
The	1
fifth	1
party	1
consisted	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
adherents	1
of	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
as	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
commander-in-	1
chief.	1
"Be	1
he	1
what	1
he	1
may"	1
(they	1
always	1
began	1
like	1
that),	1
"he	1
is	1
an	1
honest,	1
practical	1
man	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
nobody	1
better.	1
Give	1
him	1
real	1
power,	1
for	1
war	1
cannot	1
be	1
conducted	1
successfully	1
without	1
unity	1
of	1
command,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
show	1
what	1
he	1
can	1
do,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
Finland.	1
If	1
our	1
army	1
is	1
well	1
organized	1
and	1
strong	1
and	1
has	1
withdrawn	1
to	1
Drissa	1
without	1
suffering	1
any	1
defeats,	1
we	1
owe	1
this	1
entirely	1
to	1
Barclay.	1
If	1
Barclay	1
is	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
superseded	1
by	1
Bennigsen	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
lost,	1
for	1
Bennigsen	1
showed	1
his	1
incapacity	1
already	1
in	1
1807."	1
	1
The	1
sixth	1
party,	1
the	1
Bennigsenites,	1
said,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
that	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
more	1
active	1
and	1
experienced	1
than	1
Bennigsen:	1
"and	1
twist	1
about	1
as	1
you	1
may,	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Bennigsen	1
eventually.	1
Let	1
the	1
others	1
make	1
mistakes	1
now!"	1
said	1
they,	1
arguing	1
that	1
our	1
retirement	1
to	1
Drissa	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
shameful	1
reverse	1
and	1
an	1
unbroken	1
series	1
of	1
blunders.	1
"The	1
more	1
mistakes	1
that	1
are	1
made	1
the	1
better.	1
It	1
will	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
be	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
sooner	1
that	1
things	1
cannot	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this.	1
What	1
is	1
wanted	1
is	1
not	1
some	1
Barclay	1
or	1
other,	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
Bennigsen,	1
who	1
made	1
his	1
mark	1
in	1
1807,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
did	1
justice--a	1
man	1
whose	1
authority	1
would	1
be	1
willingly	1
recognized,	1
and	1
Bennigsen	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
such	1
man."	1
	1
The	1
seventh	1
party	1
consisted	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
especially	1
around	1
young	1
sovereigns,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
particularly	1
many	1
round	1
Alexander--generals	1
and	1
imperial	1
aides-de-camp	1
passionately	1
devoted	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
not	1
merely	1
as	1
a	1
monarch	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
adoring	1
him	1
sincerely	1
and	1
disinterestedly,	1
as	1
Rostov	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
1805,	1
and	1
who	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
not	1
only	1
all	1
the	1
virtues	1
but	1
all	1
human	1
capabilities	1
as	1
well.	1
These	1
men,	1
though	1
enchanted	1
with	1
the	1
sovereign	1
for	1
refusing	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
yet	1
blamed	1
him	1
for	1
such	1
excessive	1
modesty,	1
and	1
only	1
desired	1
and	1
insisted	1
that	1
their	1
adored	1
sovereign	1
should	1
abandon	1
his	1
diffidence	1
and	1
openly	1
announce	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
place	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
gather	1
round	1
him	1
a	1
commander-in-chief's	1
staff,	1
and,	1
consulting	1
experienced	1
theoreticians	1
and	1
practical	1
men	1
where	1
necessary,	1
would	1
himself	1
lead	1
the	1
troops,	1
whose	1
spirits	1
would	1
thereby	1
be	1
raised	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
pitch.	1
	1
The	1
eighth	1
and	1
largest	1
group,	1
which	1
in	1
its	1
enormous	1
numbers	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
as	1
ninety-nine	1
to	1
one,	1
consisted	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
desired	1
neither	1
peace	1
nor	1
war,	1
neither	1
an	1
advance	1
nor	1
a	1
defensive	1
camp	1
at	1
the	1
Drissa	1
or	1
anywhere	1
else,	1
neither	1
Barclay	1
nor	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
neither	1
Pfuel	1
nor	1
Bennigsen,	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
one	1
most	1
essential	1
thing--as	1
much	1
advantage	1
and	1
pleasure	1
for	1
themselves	1
as	1
possible.	1
In	1
the	1
troubled	1
waters	1
of	1
conflicting	1
and	1
intersecting	1
intrigues	1
that	1
eddied	1
about	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
headquarters,	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
succeed	1
in	1
many	1
ways	1
unthinkable	1
at	1
other	1
times.	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
simply	1
wished	1
to	1
retain	1
his	1
lucrative	1
post	1
would	1
today	1
agree	1
with	1
Pfuel,	1
tomorrow	1
with	1
his	1
opponent,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
after,	1
merely	1
to	1
avoid	1
responsibility	1
or	1
to	1
please	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
would	1
declare	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
opinion	1
at	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
matter.	1
Another	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
gain	1
some	1
advantage	1
would	1
attract	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
attention	1
by	1
loudly	1
advocating	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
hinted	1
at	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
and	1
would	1
dispute	1
and	1
shout	1
at	1
the	1
council,	1
beating	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
challenging	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
duels,	1
thereby	1
proving	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
good.	1
A	1
third,	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
opponents,	1
between	1
two	1
councils	1
would	1
simply	1
solicit	1
a	1
special	1
gratuity	1
for	1
his	1
faithful	1
services,	1
well	1
knowing	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
people	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
busy	1
to	1
refuse	1
him.	1
A	1
fourth	1
while	1
seemingly	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
work	1
would	1
often	1
come	1
accidentally	1
under	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eye.	1
A	1
fifth,	1
to	1
achieve	1
his	1
long-cherished	1
aim	1
of	1
dining	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
would	1
stubbornly	1
insist	1
on	1
the	1
correctness	1
or	1
falsity	1
of	1
some	1
newly	1
emerging	1
opinion	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
object	1
would	1
produce	1
arguments	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
forcible	1
and	1
correct.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
party	1
were	1
fishing	1
for	1
rubles,	1
decorations,	1
and	1
promotions,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
pursuit	1
watched	1
only	1
the	1
weathercock	1
of	1
imperial	1
favor,	1
and	1
directly	1
they	1
noticed	1
it	1
turning	1
in	1
any	1
direction,	1
this	1
whole	1
drone	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
began	1
blowing	1
hard	1
that	1
way,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
harder	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
turn	1
it	1
elsewhere.	1
Amid	1
the	1
uncertainties	1
of	1
the	1
position,	1
with	1
the	1
menace	1
of	1
serious	1
danger	1
giving	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
threatening	1
character	1
to	1
everything,	1
amid	1
this	1
vortex	1
of	1
intrigue,	1
egotism,	1
conflict	1
of	1
views	1
and	1
feelings,	1
and	1
the	1
diversity	1
of	1
race	1
among	1
these	1
people--this	1
eighth	1
and	1
largest	1
party	1
of	1
those	1
preoccupied	1
with	1
personal	1
interests	1
imparted	1
great	1
confusion	1
and	1
obscurity	1
to	1
the	1
common	1
task.	1
Whatever	1
question	1
arose,	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
these	1
drones,	1
without	1
having	1
finished	1
their	1
buzzing	1
on	1
a	1
previous	1
theme,	1
flew	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
one	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
hum	1
drowned	1
and	1
obscured	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
disputing	1
honestly.	1
	1
From	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
parties,	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
reached	1
the	1
army,	1
another,	1
a	1
ninth	1
party,	1
was	1
being	1
formed	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
raise	1
its	1
voice.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
party	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
reasonable	1
men	1
experienced	1
and	1
capable	1
in	1
state	1
affairs,	1
who,	1
without	1
sharing	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
conflicting	1
opinions,	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
detached	1
view	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
staff	1
at	1
headquarters	1
and	1
to	1
consider	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
muddle,	1
indecision,	1
intricacy,	1
and	1
weakness.	1
	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
party	1
said	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
wrong	1
resulted	1
chiefly	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
presence	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
with	1
his	1
military	1
court	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
consequent	1
presence	1
there	1
of	1
an	1
indefinite,	1
conditional,	1
and	1
unsteady	1
fluctuation	1
of	1
relations,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
place	1
at	1
court	1
but	1
harmful	1
in	1
an	1
army;	1
that	1
a	1
sovereign	1
should	1
reign	1
but	1
not	1
command	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
his	1
court	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
army;	1
that	1
the	1
mere	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
paralyzed	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
men	1
required	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
personal	1
safety,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
worst	1
commander-in-chief,	1
if	1
independent,	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
one	1
trammeled	1
by	1
the	1
presence	1
and	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
monarch.	1
	1
Just	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
living	1
unoccupied	1
at	1
Drissa,	1
Shishkov,	1
the	1
Secretary	1
of	1
State	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
representatives	1
of	1
this	1
party,	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
which	1
Arakcheev	1
and	1
Balashev	1
agreed	1
to	1
sign.	1
In	1
this	1
letter,	1
availing	1
himself	1
of	1
permission	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
affairs,	1
he	1
respectfully	1
suggested--on	1
the	1
plea	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
sovereign	1
to	1
arouse	1
a	1
warlike	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
capital--that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
should	1
leave	1
the	1
army.	1
	1
That	1
arousing	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
their	1
sovereign	1
and	1
his	1
call	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
defend	1
their	1
country--the	1
very	1
incitement	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
Russia's	1
triumph	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
personal	1
presence	1
in	1
Moscow--was	1
suggested	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
accepted	1
by	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
pretext	1
for	1
quitting	1
the	1
army.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
This	1
letter	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
when	1
Barclay,	1
one	1
day	1
at	1
dinner,	1
informed	1
Bolkonski	1
that	1
the	1
sovereign	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
personally,	1
to	1
question	1
him	1
about	1
Turkey,	1
and	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
to	1
present	1
himself	1
at	1
Bennigsen's	1
quarters	1
at	1
six	1
that	1
evening.	1
	1
News	1
was	1
received	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
quarters	1
that	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
a	1
fresh	1
movement	1
by	1
Napoleon	1
which	1
might	1
endanger	1
the	1
army--news	1
subsequently	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
false.	1
And	1
that	1
morning	1
Colonel	1
Michaud	1
had	1
ridden	1
round	1
the	1
Drissa	1
fortifications	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
had	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
fortified	1
camp	1
constructed	1
by	1
Pfuel,	1
and	1
till	1
then	1
considered	1
a	1
chef-d'oeuvre	1
of	1
tactical	1
science	1
which	1
would	1
ensure	1
Napoleon's	1
destruction,	1
was	1
an	1
absurdity,	1
threatening	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
arrived	1
at	1
Bennigsen's	1
quarters--a	1
country	1
gentleman's	1
house	1
of	1
moderate	1
size,	1
situated	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
Neither	1
Bennigsen	1
nor	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
there,	1
but	1
Chernyshev,	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
aide-	1
de-camp,	1
received	1
Bolkonski	1
and	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
General	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
Marquis	1
Paulucci,	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
fortifications	1
of	1
the	1
Drissa	1
camp,	1
of	1
the	1
suitability	1
of	1
which	1
serious	1
doubts	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
felt.	1
	1
Chernyshev	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
novel	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
This	1
room	1
had	1
probably	1
been	1
a	1
music	1
room;	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
an	1
organ	1
in	1
it	1
on	1
which	1
some	1
rugs	1
were	1
piled,	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
stood	1
the	1
folding	1
bedstead	1
of	1
Bennigsen's	1
adjutant.	1
This	1
adjutant	1
was	1
also	1
there	1
and	1
sat	1
dozing	1
on	1
the	1
rolled-up	1
bedding,	1
evidently	1
exhausted	1
by	1
work	1
or	1
by	1
feasting.	1
Two	1
doors	1
led	1
from	1
the	1
room,	1
one	1
straight	1
on	1
into	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
and	1
another,	1
on	1
the	1
right,	1
to	1
the	1
study.	1
Through	1
the	1
first	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
conversing	1
in	1
German	1
and	1
occasionally	1
in	1
French.	1
In	1
that	1
drawing	1
room	1
were	1
gathered,	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
wish,	1
not	1
a	1
military	1
council	1
(the	1
Emperor	1
preferred	1
indefiniteness),	1
but	1
certain	1
persons	1
whose	1
opinions	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
know	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
difficulties.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
war,	1
but,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
a	1
council	1
to	1
elucidate	1
certain	1
questions	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
personally.	1
To	1
this	1
semicouncil	1
had	1
been	1
invited	1
the	1
Swedish	1
General	1
Armfeldt,	1
Adjutant	1
General	1
Wolzogen,	1
Wintzingerode	1
(whom	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
referred	1
to	1
as	1
a	1
renegade	1
French	1
subject),	1
Michaud,	1
Toll,	1
Count	1
Stein	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
military	1
man	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
Pfuel	1
himself,	1
who,	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
heard,	1
was	1
the	1
mainspring	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
affair.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
getting	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
for	1
Pfuel	1
arrived	1
soon	1
after	1
himself	1
and,	1
in	1
passing	1
through	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
stopped	1
a	1
minute	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Chernyshev.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
sight,	1
Pfuel,	1
in	1
his	1
ill-made	1
uniform	1
of	1
a	1
Russian	1
general,	1
which	1
fitted	1
him	1
badly	1
like	1
a	1
fancy	1
costume,	1
seemed	1
familiar	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
though	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
There	1
was	1
about	1
him	1
something	1
of	1
Weyrother,	1
Mack,	1
and	1
Schmidt,	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
German	1
theorist-generals	1
whom	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
1805,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
typical	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
seen	1
a	1
German	1
theorist	1
in	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
characteristics	1
of	1
those	1
others	1
were	1
united	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
extent.	1
	1
Pfuel	1
was	1
short	1
and	1
very	1
thin	1
but	1
broad-boned,	1
of	1
coarse,	1
robust	1
build,	1
broad	1
in	1
the	1
hips,	1
and	1
with	1
prominent	1
shoulder	1
blades.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
much	1
wrinkled	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
deep	1
set.	1
His	1
hair	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
hastily	1
brushed	1
smooth	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
temples,	1
but	1
stuck	1
up	1
behind	1
in	1
quaint	1
little	1
tufts.	1
He	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
looking	1
restlessly	1
and	1
angrily	1
around,	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
of	1
everything	1
in	1
that	1
large	1
apartment.	1
Awkwardly	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
sword,	1
he	1
addressed	1
Chernyshev	1
and	1
asked	1
in	1
German	1
where	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was.	1
One	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
rooms	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible,	1
finish	1
with	1
the	1
bows	1
and	1
greetings,	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
business	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
map,	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
feel	1
at	1
home.	1
He	1
nodded	1
hurriedly	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
Chernyshev,	1
and	1
smiled	1
ironically	1
on	1
hearing	1
that	1
the	1
sovereign	1
was	1
inspecting	1
the	1
fortifications	1
that	1
he,	1
Pfuel,	1
had	1
planned	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
his	1
theory.	1
He	1
muttered	1
something	1
to	1
himself	1
abruptly	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
bass	1
voice,	1
as	1
self-assured	1
Germans	1
do--it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
"stupid	1
fellow"...	1
or	1
"the	1
whole	1
affair	1
will	1
be	1
ruined,"	1
or	1
"something	1
absurd	1
will	1
come	1
of	1
it."...	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
catch	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
passed	1
on,	1
but	1
Chernyshev	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
Pfuel,	1
remarking	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
just	1
back	1
from	1
Turkey	1
where	1
the	1
war	1
had	1
terminated	1
so	1
fortunately.	1
Pfuel	1
barely	1
glanced--not	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
as	1
past	1
him--and	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh:	1
"That	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
fine	1
tactical	1
war";	1
and,	1
laughing	1
contemptuously,	1
went	1
on	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
was	1
heard.	1
	1
Pfuel,	1
always	1
inclined	1
to	1
be	1
irritably	1
sarcastic,	1
was	1
particularly	1
disturbed	1
that	1
day,	1
evidently	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
dared	1
to	1
inspect	1
and	1
criticize	1
his	1
camp	1
in	1
his	1
absence.	1
From	1
this	1
short	1
interview	1
with	1
Pfuel,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
Austerlitz	1
experiences,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
clear	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
Pfuel	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
hopelessly	1
and	1
immutably	1
self-confident	1
men,	1
self-confident	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
martyrdom	1
as	1
only	1
Germans	1
are,	1
because	1
only	1
Germans	1
are	1
self-confident	1
on	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
an	1
abstract	1
notion--science,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
supposed	1
knowledge	1
of	1
absolute	1
truth.	1
A	1
Frenchman	1
is	1
self-assured	1
because	1
he	1
regards	1
himself	1
personally,	1
both	1
in	1
mind	1
and	1
body,	1
as	1
irresistibly	1
attractive	1
to	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
An	1
Englishman	1
is	1
self-assured,	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
citizen	1
of	1
the	1
best-organized	1
state	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
therefore	1
as	1
an	1
Englishman	1
always	1
knows	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
and	1
knows	1
that	1
all	1
he	1
does	1
as	1
an	1
Englishman	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
correct.	1
An	1
Italian	1
is	1
self-assured	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
excitable	1
and	1
easily	1
forgets	1
himself	1
and	1
other	1
people.	1
A	1
Russian	1
is	1
self-assured	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
knows	1
nothing	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
anything,	1
since	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
anything	1
can	1
be	1
known.	1
The	1
German's	1
self-assurance	1
is	1
worst	1
of	1
all,	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
repulsive	1
than	1
any	1
other,	1
because	1
he	1
imagines	1
that	1
he	1
knows	1
the	1
truth--science--	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
has	1
invented	1
but	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
absolute	1
truth.	1
	1
Pfuel	1
was	1
evidently	1
of	1
that	1
sort.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
science--the	1
theory	1
of	1
oblique	1
movements	1
deduced	1
by	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Frederick	1
the	1
Great's	1
wars,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
came	1
across	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
more	1
recent	1
warfare	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
absurd	1
and	1
barbarous--monstrous	1
collisions	1
in	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
blunders	1
were	1
committed	1
by	1
both	1
sides	1
that	1
these	1
wars	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
wars,	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
theory,	1
and	1
therefore	1
could	1
not	1
serve	1
as	1
material	1
for	1
science.	1
	1
In	1
1806	1
Pfuel	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
responsible,	1
for	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign	1
that	1
ended	1
in	1
Jena	1
and	1
Auerstadt,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
least	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
fallibility	1
of	1
his	1
theory	1
in	1
the	1
disasters	1
of	1
that	1
war.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
the	1
deviations	1
made	1
from	1
his	1
theory	1
were,	1
in	1
his	1
opinion,	1
the	1
sole	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
disaster,	1
and	1
with	1
characteristically	1
gleeful	1
sarcasm	1
he	1
would	1
remark,	1
"There,	1
I	1
said	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
devil!"	1
Pfuel	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
theoreticians	1
who	1
so	1
love	1
their	1
theory	1
that	1
they	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
theory's	1
object--its	1
practical	1
application.	1
His	1
love	1
of	1
theory	1
made	1
him	1
hate	1
everything	1
practical,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
even	1
pleased	1
by	1
failures,	1
for	1
failures	1
resulting	1
from	1
deviations	1
in	1
practice	1
from	1
the	1
theory	1
only	1
proved	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
accuracy	1
of	1
his	1
theory.	1
	1
He	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Chernyshev	1
about	1
the	1
present	1
war,	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
knows	1
beforehand	1
that	1
all	1
will	1
go	1
wrong,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
displeased	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
so.	1
The	1
unbrushed	1
tufts	1
of	1
hair	1
sticking	1
up	1
behind	1
and	1
the	1
hastily	1
brushed	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
temples	1
expressed	1
this	1
most	1
eloquently.	1
	1
He	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room,	1
and	1
the	1
deep,	1
querulous	1
sounds	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
heard	1
from	1
there.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
eyes	1
were	1
still	1
following	1
Pfuel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
when	1
Count	1
Bennigsen	1
entered	1
hurriedly,	1
and	1
nodding	1
to	1
Bolkonski,	1
but	1
not	1
pausing,	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
study,	1
giving	1
instructions	1
to	1
his	1
adjutant	1
as	1
he	1
went.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
following	1
him,	1
and	1
Bennigsen	1
had	1
hastened	1
on	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
preparations	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
sovereign.	1
Chernyshev	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch,	1
where	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
who	1
looked	1
fatigued,	1
was	1
dismounting.	1
Marquis	1
Paulucci	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
particular	1
warmth	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
bent	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
was	1
listening	1
with	1
a	1
dissatisfied	1
air.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
moved	1
forward	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
conversation,	1
but	1
the	1
flushed	1
and	1
excited	1
Italian,	1
oblivious	1
of	1
decorum,	1
followed	1
him	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
"And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
advised	1
forming	1
this	1
camp--the	1
Drissa	1
camp,"	1
said	1
Paulucci,	1
as	1
the	1
Emperor	1
mounted	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
noticing	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
scanned	1
his	1
unfamiliar	1
face,	1
"as	1
to	1
that	1
person,	1
sire..."	1
continued	1
Paulucci,	1
desperately,	1
apparently	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
himself,	1
"the	1
man	1
who	1
advised	1
the	1
Drissa	1
camp--I	1
see	1
no	1
alternative	1
but	1
the	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
or	1
the	1
gallows!"	1
	1
Without	1
heeding	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Italian's	1
remarks,	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
not	1
hearing	1
them,	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
recognizing	1
Bolkonski,	1
addressed	1
him	1
graciously.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you!	1
Go	1
in	1
there	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
meeting,	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
study.	1
He	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
Prince	1
Peter	1
Mikhaylovich	1
Volkonski	1
and	1
Baron	1
Stein,	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
closed	1
behind	1
them.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
permission,	1
accompanied	1
Paulucci,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
Turkey,	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
council	1
was	1
assembled.	1
	1
Prince	1
Peter	1
Mikhaylovich	1
Volkonski	1
occupied	1
the	1
position,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
of	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
staff.	1
He	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
some	1
maps	1
which	1
he	1
spread	1
on	1
a	1
table,	1
and	1
put	1
questions	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
present.	1
What	1
had	1
happened	1
was	1
that	1
news	1
(which	1
afterwards	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
false)	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
a	1
movement	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
outflank	1
the	1
Drissa	1
camp.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
speak	1
was	1
General	1
Armfeldt	1
who,	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
difficulty	1
that	1
presented	1
itself,	1
unexpectedly	1
proposed	1
a	1
perfectly	1
new	1
position	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
Moscow	1
roads.	1
The	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
inexplicable	1
(unless	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he,	1
too,	1
could	1
have	1
an	1
opinion),	1
but	1
he	1
urged	1
that	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
the	1
army	1
should	1
unite	1
and	1
there	1
await	1
the	1
enemy.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
Armfeldt	1
had	1
thought	1
out	1
that	1
plan	1
long	1
ago	1
and	1
now	1
expounded	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
questions	1
put--which,	1
in	1
fact,	1
his	1
plan	1
did	1
not	1
answer--as	1
to	1
avail	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
air	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
proposals,	1
one	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
another,	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
unknown	1
what	1
character	1
the	1
war	1
would	1
take.	1
Some	1
disputed	1
his	1
arguments,	1
others	1
defended	1
them.	1
Young	1
Count	1
Toll	1
objected	1
to	1
the	1
Swedish	1
general's	1
views	1
more	1
warmly	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
dispute	1
drew	1
from	1
his	1
side	1
pocket	1
a	1
well-filled	1
notebook,	1
which	1
he	1
asked	1
permission	1
to	1
read	1
to	1
them.	1
In	1
these	1
voluminous	1
notes	1
Toll	1
suggested	1
another	1
scheme,	1
totally	1
different	1
from	1
Armfeldt's	1
or	1
Pfuel's	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign.	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
Toll,	1
Paulucci	1
suggested	1
an	1
advance	1
and	1
an	1
attack,	1
which,	1
he	1
urged,	1
could	1
alone	1
extricate	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
present	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
trap	1
(as	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
Drissa	1
camp)	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
situated.	1
	1
During	1
all	1
these	1
discussions	1
Pfuel	1
and	1
his	1
interpreter,	1
Wolzogen	1
(his	1
"bridge"	1
in	1
court	1
relations),	1
were	1
silent.	1
Pfuel	1
only	1
snorted	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
turned	1
away,	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
demean	1
himself	1
by	1
replying	1
to	1
such	1
nonsense	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
hearing.	1
So	1
when	1
Prince	1
Volkonski,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
chair,	1
called	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
opinion,	1
he	1
merely	1
said:	1
	1
"Why	1
ask	1
me?	1
General	1
Armfeldt	1
has	1
proposed	1
a	1
splendid	1
position	1
with	1
an	1
exposed	1
rear,	1
or	1
why	1
not	1
this	1
Italian	1
gentleman's	1
attack--very	1
fine,	1
or	1
a	1
retreat,	1
also	1
good!	1
Why	1
ask	1
me?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
yourselves	1
know	1
everything	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
do."	1
	1
But	1
when	1
Volkonski	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
frown,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
name	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
opinion,	1
Pfuel	1
rose	1
and,	1
suddenly	1
growing	1
animated,	1
began	1
to	1
speak:	1
	1
"Everything	1
has	1
been	1
spoiled,	1
everything	1
muddled,	1
everybody	1
thought	1
they	1
knew	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
did,	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
me!	1
How	1
mend	1
matters?	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
mend!	1
The	1
principles	1
laid	1
down	1
by	1
me	1
must	1
be	1
strictly	1
adhered	1
to,"	1
said	1
he,	1
drumming	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
bony	1
fingers.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
difficulty?	1
Nonsense,	1
childishness!"	1
	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
map	1
and	1
speaking	1
rapidly	1
began	1
proving	1
that	1
no	1
eventuality	1
could	1
alter	1
the	1
efficiency	1
of	1
the	1
Drissa	1
camp,	1
that	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
foreseen,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
enemy	1
were	1
really	1
going	1
to	1
outflank	1
it,	1
the	1
enemy	1
would	1
inevitably	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
Paulucci,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
German,	1
began	1
questioning	1
him	1
in	1
French.	1
Wolzogen	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
chief,	1
who	1
spoke	1
French	1
badly,	1
and	1
began	1
translating	1
for	1
him,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
Pfuel,	1
who	1
was	1
rapidly	1
demonstrating	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened,	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
happen,	1
had	1
been	1
foreseen	1
in	1
his	1
scheme,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
any	1
difficulties	1
the	1
whole	1
fault	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
plan	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
precisely	1
executed.	1
He	1
kept	1
laughing	1
sarcastically,	1
he	1
demonstrated,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
contemptuously	1
ceased	1
to	1
demonstrate,	1
like	1
a	1
mathematician	1
who	1
ceases	1
to	1
prove	1
in	1
various	1
ways	1
the	1
accuracy	1
of	1
a	1
problem	1
that	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
proved.	1
Wolzogen	1
took	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
views	1
in	1
French,	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
to	1
Pfuel	1
and	1
saying,	1
"Is	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
But	1
Pfuel,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
heated	1
in	1
a	1
fight	1
who	1
strikes	1
those	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
side,	1
shouted	1
angrily	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
supporter,	1
Wolzogen:	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course,	1
what	1
more	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
explain?"	1
	1
Paulucci	1
and	1
Michaud	1
both	1
attacked	1
Wolzogen	1
simultaneously	1
in	1
French.	1
Armfeldt	1
addressed	1
Pfuel	1
in	1
German.	1
Toll	1
explained	1
to	1
Volkonski	1
in	1
Russian.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
listened	1
and	1
observed	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
Of	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sympathized	1
most	1
with	1
Pfuel,	1
angry,	1
determined,	1
and	1
absurdly	1
self-confident	1
as	1
he	1
was.	1
Of	1
all	1
those	1
present,	1
evidently	1
he	1
alone	1
was	1
not	1
seeking	1
anything	1
for	1
himself,	1
nursed	1
no	1
hatred	1
against	1
anyone,	1
and	1
only	1
desired	1
that	1
the	1
plan,	1
formed	1
on	1
a	1
theory	1
arrived	1
at	1
by	1
years	1
of	1
toil,	1
should	1
be	1
carried	1
out.	1
He	1
was	1
ridiculous,	1
and	1
unpleasantly	1
sarcastic,	1
but	1
yet	1
he	1
inspired	1
involuntary	1
respect	1
by	1
his	1
boundless	1
devotion	1
to	1
an	1
idea.	1
Besides	1
this,	1
the	1
remarks	1
of	1
all	1
except	1
Pfuel	1
had	1
one	1
common	1
trait	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
noticeable	1
at	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
in	1
1805:	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
panic	1
fear	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
genius,	1
which,	1
though	1
concealed,	1
was	1
noticeable	1
in	1
every	1
rejoinder.	1
Everything	1
was	1
assumed	1
to	1
be	1
possible	1
for	1
Napoleon,	1
they	1
expected	1
him	1
from	1
every	1
side,	1
and	1
invoked	1
his	1
terrible	1
name	1
to	1
shatter	1
each	1
other's	1
proposals.	1
Pfuel	1
alone	1
seemed	1
to	1
consider	1
Napoleon	1
a	1
barbarian	1
like	1
everyone	1
else	1
who	1
opposed	1
his	1
theory.	1
But	1
besides	1
this	1
feeling	1
of	1
respect,	1
Pfuel	1
evoked	1
pity	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
From	1
the	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
courtiers	1
addressed	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
Paulucci	1
had	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
but	1
above	1
all	1
from	1
a	1
certain	1
desperation	1
in	1
Pfuel's	1
own	1
expressions,	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
others	1
knew,	1
and	1
Pfuel	1
himself	1
felt,	1
that	1
his	1
fall	1
was	1
at	1
hand.	1
And	1
despite	1
his	1
self-confidence	1
and	1
grumpy	1
German	1
sarcasm	1
he	1
was	1
pitiable,	1
with	1
his	1
hair	1
smoothly	1
brushed	1
on	1
the	1
temples	1
and	1
sticking	1
up	1
in	1
tufts	1
behind.	1
Though	1
he	1
concealed	1
the	1
fact	1
under	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
irritation	1
and	1
contempt,	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
in	1
despair	1
that	1
the	1
sole	1
remaining	1
chance	1
of	1
verifying	1
his	1
theory	1
by	1
a	1
huge	1
experiment	1
and	1
proving	1
its	1
soundness	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
was	1
slipping	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
discussions	1
continued	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
longer	1
they	1
lasted	1
the	1
more	1
heated	1
became	1
the	1
disputes,	1
culminating	1
in	1
shouts	1
and	1
personalities,	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
was	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
any	1
general	1
conclusion	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
said.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
listening	1
to	1
this	1
polyglot	1
talk	1
and	1
to	1
these	1
surmises,	1
plans,	1
refutations,	1
and	1
shouts,	1
felt	1
nothing	1
but	1
amazement	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying.	1
A	1
thought	1
that	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
and	1
often	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
during	1
his	1
military	1
activities--the	1
idea	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
any	1
science	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
military	1
genius--now	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
an	1
obvious	1
truth.	1
"What	1
theory	1
and	1
science	1
is	1
possible	1
about	1
a	1
matter	1
the	1
conditions	1
and	1
circumstances	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
unknown	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
defined,	1
especially	1
when	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
acting	1
forces	1
cannot	1
be	1
ascertained?	1
No	1
one	1
was	1
or	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
foresee	1
in	1
what	1
condition	1
our	1
or	1
the	1
enemy's	1
armies	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
day's	1
time,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
gauge	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
detachment.	1
Sometimes--when	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
coward	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
to	1
shout,	1
'We	1
are	1
cut	1
off!'	1
and	1
start	1
running,	1
but	1
a	1
brave	1
and	1
jolly	1
lad	1
who	1
shouts,	1
'Hurrah!'--a	1
detachment	1
of	1
five	1
thousand	1
is	1
worth	1
thirty	1
thousand,	1
as	1
at	1
Schon	1
Grabern,	1
while	1
at	1
times	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
run	1
from	1
eight	1
thousand,	1
as	1
at	1
Austerlitz.	1
What	1
science	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
in	1
which,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
practical	1
matters,	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
defined	1
and	1
everything	1
depends	1
on	1
innumerable	1
conditions,	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
determined	1
at	1
a	1
particular	1
moment	1
which	1
arrives	1
no	1
one	1
knows	1
when?	1
Armfeldt	1
says	1
our	1
army	1
is	1
cut	1
in	1
half,	1
and	1
Paulucci	1
says	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
between	1
two	1
fires;	1
Michaud	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
worthlessness	1
of	1
the	1
Drissa	1
camp	1
lies	1
in	1
having	1
the	1
river	1
behind	1
it,	1
and	1
Pfuel	1
says	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
constitutes	1
its	1
strength;	1
Toll	1
proposes	1
one	1
plan,	1
Armfeldt	1
another,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
good	1
and	1
all	1
bad,	1
and	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
any	1
suggestions	1
can	1
be	1
seen	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
trial.	1
And	1
why	1
do	1
they	1
all	1
speak	1
of	1
a	1
'military	1
genius'?	1
Is	1
a	1
man	1
a	1
genius	1
who	1
can	1
order	1
bread	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time	1
and	1
say	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
who	1
to	1
the	1
left?	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
military	1
men	1
are	1
invested	1
with	1
pomp	1
and	1
power	1
and	1
crowds	1
of	1
sychophants	1
flatter	1
power,	1
attributing	1
to	1
it	1
qualities	1
of	1
genius	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
possess.	1
The	1
best	1
generals	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
were,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
stupid	1
or	1
absent-minded	1
men.	1
Bagration	1
was	1
the	1
best,	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
admitted	1
that.	1
And	1
of	1
Bonaparte	1
himself!	1
I	1
remember	1
his	1
limited,	1
self-satisfied	1
face	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Austerlitz.	1
Not	1
only	1
does	1
a	1
good	1
army	1
commander	1
not	1
need	1
any	1
special	1
qualities,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
needs	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
and	1
best	1
human	1
attributes--love,	1
poetry,	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
philosophic	1
inquiring	1
doubt.	1
He	1
should	1
be	1
limited,	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
doing	1
is	1
very	1
important	1
(otherwise	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
sufficient	1
patience),	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
brave	1
leader.	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
humane,	1
should	1
love,	1
or	1
pity,	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
unjust.	1
It	1
is	1
understandable	1
that	1
a	1
theory	1
of	1
their	1
'genius'	1
was	1
invented	1
for	1
them	1
long	1
ago	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
power!	1
The	1
success	1
of	1
a	1
military	1
action	1
depends	1
not	1
on	1
them,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
who	1
shouts,	1
'We	1
are	1
lost!'	1
or	1
who	1
shouts,	1
'Hurrah!'	1
And	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
can	1
one	1
serve	1
with	1
assurance	1
of	1
being	1
useful."	1
	1
So	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
talking,	1
and	1
he	1
roused	1
himself	1
only	1
when	1
Paulucci	1
called	1
him	1
and	1
everyone	1
was	1
leaving.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
review	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
Emperor	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
serve,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lost	1
his	1
standing	1
in	1
court	1
circles	1
forever	1
by	1
not	1
asking	1
to	1
remain	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
sovereign's	1
person,	1
but	1
for	1
permission	1
to	1
serve	1
in	1
the	1
army.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
Before	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
Rostov	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
parents	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
briefly	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
illness	1
and	1
the	1
breaking	1
off	1
of	1
her	1
engagement	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
(which	1
they	1
explained	1
by	1
Natasha's	1
having	1
rejected	1
him)	1
and	1
again	1
asked	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
return	1
home.	1
On	1
receiving	1
this	1
letter,	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
make	1
any	1
attempt	1
to	1
get	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
or	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
army,	1
but	1
wrote	1
to	1
his	1
parents	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
Natasha	1
was	1
ill	1
and	1
her	1
engagement	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
meet	1
their	1
wishes.	1
To	1
Sonya	1
he	1
wrote	1
separately.	1
	1
"Adored	1
friend	1
of	1
my	1
soul!"	1
he	1
wrote.	1
"Nothing	1
but	1
honor	1
could	1
keep	1
me	1
from	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
country.	1
But	1
now,	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
I	1
should	1
feel	1
dishonored,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
my	1
comrades'	1
eyes	1
but	1
in	1
my	1
own,	1
if	1
I	1
preferred	1
my	1
own	1
happiness	1
to	1
my	1
love	1
and	1
duty	1
to	1
the	1
Fatherland.	1
But	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
our	1
last	1
separation.	1
Believe	1
me,	1
directly	1
the	1
war	1
is	1
over,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
alive	1
and	1
still	1
loved	1
by	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
throw	1
up	1
everything	1
and	1
fly	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
press	1
you	1
forever	1
to	1
my	1
ardent	1
breast."	1
	1
It	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
only	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
that	1
prevented	1
Rostov	1
from	1
returning	1
home	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
and	1
marrying	1
Sonya.	1
The	1
autumn	1
in	1
Otradnoe	1
with	1
the	1
hunting,	1
and	1
the	1
winter	1
with	1
the	1
Christmas	1
holidays	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
love,	1
had	1
opened	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
vista	1
of	1
tranquil	1
rural	1
joys	1
and	1
peace	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
known	1
before,	1
and	1
which	1
now	1
allured	1
him.	1
"A	1
splendid	1
wife,	1
children,	1
a	1
good	1
pack	1
of	1
hounds,	1
a	1
dozen	1
leashes	1
of	1
smart	1
borzois,	1
agriculture,	1
neighbors,	1
service	1
by	1
election..."	1
thought	1
he.	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
campaign	1
was	1
beginning,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
his	1
regiment.	1
And	1
since	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
so,	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov,	1
as	1
was	1
natural	1
to	1
him,	1
felt	1
contented	1
with	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
led	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
pleasure	1
in	1
that	1
life.	1
	1
On	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
his	1
furlough	1
Nicholas,	1
having	1
been	1
joyfully	1
welcomed	1
by	1
his	1
comrades,	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
obtain	1
remounts	1
and	1
brought	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
Ukraine	1
excellent	1
horses	1
which	1
pleased	1
him	1
and	1
earned	1
him	1
commendation	1
from	1
his	1
commanders.	1
During	1
his	1
absence	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
promoted	1
captain,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
put	1
on	1
war	1
footing	1
with	1
an	1
increase	1
in	1
numbers,	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
allotted	1
his	1
old	1
squadron.	1
	1
The	1
campaign	1
began,	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
moved	1
into	1
Poland	1
on	1
double	1
pay,	1
new	1
officers	1
arrived,	1
new	1
men	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
everybody	1
was	1
infected	1
with	1
the	1
merrily	1
excited	1
mood	1
that	1
goes	1
with	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
a	1
war,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
advantageous	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
devoted	1
himself	1
entirely	1
to	1
the	1
pleasures	1
and	1
interests	1
of	1
military	1
service,	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
relinquish	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
troops	1
retired	1
from	1
Vilna	1
for	1
various	1
complicated	1
reasons	1
of	1
state,	1
political	1
and	1
strategic.	1
Each	1
step	1
of	1
the	1
retreat	1
was	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
complicated	1
interplay	1
of	1
interests,	1
arguments,	1
and	1
passions	1
at	1
headquarters.	1
For	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
hussars,	1
however,	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
retreat	1
during	1
the	1
finest	1
period	1
of	1
summer	1
and	1
with	1
sufficient	1
supplies	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
agreeable	1
business.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
at	1
headquarters	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
depression,	1
uneasiness,	1
and	1
intriguing;	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
themselves	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
or	1
why.	1
If	1
they	1
regretted	1
having	1
to	1
retreat,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
leave	1
billets	1
they	1
had	1
grown	1
accustomed	1
to,	1
or	1
some	1
pretty	1
young	1
Polish	1
lady.	1
If	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
things	1
looked	1
bad	1
chanced	1
to	1
enter	1
anyone's	1
head,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
cheerful	1
as	1
befits	1
a	1
good	1
soldier	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
trend	1
of	1
affairs,	1
but	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
task	1
nearest	1
to	1
hand.	1
First	1
they	1
camped	1
gaily	1
before	1
Vilna,	1
making	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
Polish	1
landowners,	1
preparing	1
for	1
reviews	1
and	1
being	1
reviewed	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
other	1
high	1
commanders.	1
Then	1
came	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
retreat	1
to	1
Sventsyani	1
and	1
destroy	1
any	1
provisions	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
away	1
with	1
them.	1
Sventsyani	1
was	1
remembered	1
by	1
the	1
hussars	1
only	1
as	1
the	1
drunken	1
camp,	1
a	1
name	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
gave	1
to	1
their	1
encampment	1
there,	1
and	1
because	1
many	1
complaints	1
were	1
made	1
against	1
the	1
troops,	1
who,	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
collect	1
provisions,	1
took	1
also	1
horses,	1
carriages,	1
and	1
carpets	1
from	1
the	1
Polish	1
proprietors.	1
Rostov	1
remembered	1
Sventsyani,	1
because	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
arrival	1
at	1
that	1
small	1
town	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
sergeant	1
major	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
manage	1
all	1
the	1
drunken	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
squadron	1
who,	1
unknown	1
to	1
him,	1
had	1
appropriated	1
five	1
barrels	1
of	1
old	1
beer.	1
From	1
Sventsyani	1
they	1
retired	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
to	1
Drissa,	1
and	1
thence	1
again	1
beyond	1
Drissa,	1
drawing	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
frontier	1
of	1
Russia	1
proper.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
of	1
July	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
action	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twelfth	1
of	1
July,	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
that	1
action,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
heavy	1
storm	1
of	1
rain	1
and	1
hail.	1
In	1
general,	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
1812	1
was	1
remarkable	1
for	1
its	1
storms.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
Pavlograd	1
squadrons	1
were	1
bivouacking	1
on	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
rye,	1
which	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
ear	1
but	1
had	1
been	1
completely	1
trodden	1
down	1
by	1
cattle	1
and	1
horses.	1
The	1
rain	1
was	1
descending	1
in	1
torrents,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
officer	1
named	1
Ilyin,	1
his	1
protege,	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
hastily	1
constructed	1
shelter.	1
An	1
officer	1
of	1
their	1
regiment,	1
with	1
long	1
mustaches	1
extending	1
onto	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
who	1
after	1
riding	1
to	1
the	1
staff	1
had	1
been	1
overtaken	1
by	1
the	1
rain,	1
entered	1
Rostov's	1
shelter.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
staff,	1
Count.	1
Have	1
you	1
heard	1
of	1
Raevski's	1
exploit?"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
officer	1
gave	1
them	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
Saltanov	1
battle,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
staff.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
smoking	1
his	1
pipe	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
head	1
about	1
as	1
the	1
water	1
trickled	1
down	1
his	1
neck,	1
listened	1
inattentively,	1
with	1
an	1
occasional	1
glance	1
at	1
Ilyin,	1
who	1
was	1
pressing	1
close	1
to	1
him.	1
This	1
officer,	1
a	1
lad	1
of	1
sixteen	1
who	1
had	1
recently	1
joined	1
the	1
regiment,	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
relation	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
Denisov	1
seven	1
years	1
before.	1
Ilyin	1
tried	1
to	1
imitate	1
Rostov	1
in	1
everything	1
and	1
adored	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
girl	1
might	1
have	1
done.	1
	1
Zdrzhinski,	1
the	1
officer	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
mustache,	1
spoke	1
grandiloquently	1
of	1
the	1
Saltanov	1
dam	1
being	1
"a	1
Russian	1
Thermopylae,"	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
a	1
deed	1
worthy	1
of	1
antiquity	1
had	1
been	1
performed	1
by	1
General	1
Raevski.	1
He	1
recounted	1
how	1
Raevski	1
had	1
led	1
his	1
two	1
sons	1
onto	1
the	1
dam	1
under	1
terrific	1
fire	1
and	1
had	1
charged	1
with	1
them	1
beside	1
him.	1
Rostov	1
heard	1
the	1
story	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
encourage	1
Zdrzhinski's	1
enthusiasm	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
ashamed	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
hearing,	1
though	1
with	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
contradicting	1
it.	1
Since	1
the	1
campaigns	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
and	1
of	1
1807	1
Rostov	1
knew	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
men	1
always	1
lie	1
when	1
describing	1
military	1
exploits,	1
as	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
recounting	1
them;	1
besides	1
that,	1
he	1
had	1
experience	1
enough	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
nothing	1
happens	1
in	1
war	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
imagine	1
or	1
relate	1
it.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
Zdrzhinski's	1
tale,	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
like	1
Zdrzhinski	1
himself	1
who,	1
with	1
his	1
mustaches	1
extending	1
over	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
bent	1
low	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
hearer,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
habit,	1
and	1
crowded	1
Rostov	1
in	1
the	1
narrow	1
shanty.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
"In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
confusion	1
and	1
crowding	1
on	1
the	1
dam	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
attacked	1
that	1
if	1
Raevski	1
did	1
lead	1
his	1
sons	1
there,	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
effect	1
except	1
perhaps	1
on	1
some	1
dozen	1
men	1
nearest	1
to	1
him,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"the	1
rest	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
or	1
with	1
whom	1
Raevski	1
came	1
onto	1
the	1
dam.	1
And	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
see	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
stimulated	1
by	1
it,	1
for	1
what	1
had	1
they	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
Raevski's	1
tender	1
paternal	1
feelings	1
when	1
their	1
own	1
skins	1
were	1
in	1
danger?	1
And	1
besides,	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
Fatherland	1
did	1
not	1
depend	1
on	1
whether	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
Saltanov	1
dam	1
or	1
not,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
told	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
at	1
Thermopylae.	1
So	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
have	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
sacrifice?	1
And	1
why	1
expose	1
his	1
own	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
battle?	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
taken	1
my	1
brother	1
Petya	1
there,	1
or	1
even	1
Ilyin,	1
who's	1
a	1
stranger	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
a	1
nice	1
lad,	1
but	1
would	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
somewhere	1
under	1
cover,"	1
Nicholas	1
continued	1
to	1
think,	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
Zdrzhinski.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
for	1
in	1
such	1
matters,	1
too,	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
experience.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
tale	1
redounded	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1
arms	1
and	1
so	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
pretend	1
not	1
to	1
doubt	1
it.	1
And	1
he	1
acted	1
accordingly.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
stand	1
this	1
any	1
more,"	1
said	1
Ilyin,	1
noticing	1
that	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
relish	1
Zdrzhinski's	1
conversation.	1
"My	1
stockings	1
and	1
shirt...	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
is	1
running	1
on	1
my	1
seat!	1
I'll	1
go	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
shelter.	1
The	1
rain	1
seems	1
less	1
heavy."	1
	1
Ilyin	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
Zdrzhinski	1
rode	1
away.	1
	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
Ilyin,	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud,	1
came	1
running	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
shanty.	1
	1
"Hurrah!	1
Rostov,	1
come	1
quick!	1
I've	1
found	1
it!	1
About	1
two	1
hundred	1
yards	1
away	1
there's	1
a	1
tavern	1
where	1
ours	1
have	1
already	1
gathered.	1
We	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
get	1
dry	1
there,	1
and	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna's	1
there."	1
	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna	1
was	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
regimental	1
doctor,	1
a	1
pretty	1
young	1
German	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
in	1
Poland.	1
The	1
doctor,	1
whether	1
from	1
lack	1
of	1
means	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
his	1
young	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
marriage,	1
took	1
her	1
about	1
with	1
him	1
wherever	1
the	1
hussar	1
regiment	1
went	1
and	1
his	1
jealousy	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
standing	1
joke	1
among	1
the	1
hussar	1
officers.	1
	1
Rostov	1
threw	1
his	1
cloak	1
over	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
shouted	1
to	1
Lavrushka	1
to	1
follow	1
with	1
the	1
things,	1
and--now	1
slipping	1
in	1
the	1
mud,	1
now	1
splashing	1
right	1
through	1
it--set	1
off	1
with	1
Ilyin	1
in	1
the	1
lessening	1
rain	1
and	1
the	1
darkness	1
that	1
was	1
occasionally	1
rent	1
by	1
distant	1
lightning.	1
	1
"Rostov,	1
where	1
are	1
you?"	1
	1
"Here.	1
What	1
lightning!"	1
they	1
called	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
In	1
the	1
tavern,	1
before	1
which	1
stood	1
the	1
doctor's	1
covered	1
cart,	1
there	1
were	1
already	1
some	1
five	1
officers.	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna,	1
a	1
plump	1
little	1
blonde	1
German,	1
in	1
a	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
and	1
nightcap,	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
broad	1
bench	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
corner.	1
Her	1
husband,	1
the	1
doctor,	1
lay	1
asleep	1
behind	1
her.	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Ilyin,	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
room,	1
were	1
welcomed	1
with	1
merry	1
shouts	1
and	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Dear	1
me,	1
how	1
jolly	1
we	1
are!"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
laughing.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
stand	1
there	1
gaping?"	1
	1
"What	1
swells	1
they	1
are!	1
Why,	1
the	1
water	1
streams	1
from	1
them!	1
Don't	1
make	1
our	1
drawing	1
room	1
so	1
wet."	1
	1
"Don't	1
mess	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna's	1
dress!"	1
cried	1
other	1
voices.	1
	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Ilyin	1
hastened	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
corner	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
change	1
into	1
dry	1
clothes	1
without	1
offending	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna's	1
modesty.	1
They	1
were	1
going	1
into	1
a	1
tiny	1
recess	1
behind	1
a	1
partition	1
to	1
change,	1
but	1
found	1
it	1
completely	1
filled	1
by	1
three	1
officers	1
who	1
sat	1
playing	1
cards	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
solitary	1
candle	1
on	1
an	1
empty	1
box,	1
and	1
these	1
officers	1
would	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
yield	1
their	1
position.	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna	1
obliged	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
loan	1
of	1
a	1
petticoat	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
curtain,	1
and	1
behind	1
that	1
screen	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Ilyin,	1
helped	1
by	1
Lavrushka	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
their	1
kits,	1
changed	1
their	1
wet	1
things	1
for	1
dry	1
ones.	1
	1
A	1
fire	1
was	1
made	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
dilapidated	1
brick	1
stove.	1
A	1
board	1
was	1
found,	1
fixed	1
on	1
two	1
saddles	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
horsecloth,	1
a	1
small	1
samovar	1
was	1
produced	1
and	1
a	1
cellaret	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum,	1
and	1
having	1
asked	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna	1
to	1
preside,	1
they	1
all	1
crowded	1
round	1
her.	1
One	1
offered	1
her	1
a	1
clean	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
wipe	1
her	1
charming	1
hands,	1
another	1
spread	1
a	1
jacket	1
under	1
her	1
little	1
feet	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
damp,	1
another	1
hung	1
his	1
coat	1
over	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
the	1
draft,	1
and	1
yet	1
another	1
waved	1
the	1
flies	1
off	1
her	1
husband's	1
face,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
wake	1
up.	1
	1
"Leave	1
him	1
alone,"	1
said	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna,	1
smiling	1
timidly	1
and	1
happily.	1
"He	1
is	1
sleeping	1
well	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
after	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna,"	1
replied	1
the	1
officer,	1
"one	1
must	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
doctor.	1
Perhaps	1
he'll	1
take	1
pity	1
on	1
me	1
someday,	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
cutting	1
off	1
a	1
leg	1
or	1
an	1
arm	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
There	1
were	1
only	1
three	1
tumblers,	1
the	1
water	1
was	1
so	1
muddy	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
the	1
tea	1
was	1
strong	1
or	1
weak,	1
and	1
the	1
samovar	1
held	1
only	1
six	1
tumblers	1
of	1
water,	1
but	1
this	1
made	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
pleasanter	1
to	1
take	1
turns	1
in	1
order	1
of	1
seniority	1
to	1
receive	1
one's	1
tumbler	1
from	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna's	1
plump	1
little	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
short	1
and	1
not	1
overclean	1
nails.	1
All	1
the	1
officers	1
appeared	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
really	1
were,	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
evening.	1
Even	1
those	1
playing	1
cards	1
behind	1
the	1
partition	1
soon	1
left	1
their	1
game	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
samovar,	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
mood	1
of	1
courting	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna.	1
She,	1
seeing	1
herself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
such	1
brilliant	1
and	1
polite	1
young	1
men,	1
beamed	1
with	1
satisfaction,	1
try	1
as	1
she	1
might	1
to	1
hide	1
it,	1
and	1
perturbed	1
as	1
she	1
evidently	1
was	1
each	1
time	1
her	1
husband	1
moved	1
in	1
his	1
sleep	1
behind	1
her.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
spoon,	1
sugar	1
was	1
more	1
plentiful	1
than	1
anything	1
else,	1
but	1
it	1
took	1
too	1
long	1
to	1
dissolve,	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
that	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna	1
should	1
stir	1
the	1
sugar	1
for	1
everyone	1
in	1
turn.	1
Rostov	1
received	1
his	1
tumbler,	1
and	1
adding	1
some	1
rum	1
to	1
it	1
asked	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna	1
to	1
stir	1
it.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
take	1
it	1
without	1
sugar?"	1
she	1
said,	1
smiling	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
as	1
if	1
everything	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
everything	1
the	1
others	1
said	1
was	1
very	1
amusing	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
double	1
meaning.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
sugar	1
I	1
want,	1
but	1
only	1
that	1
your	1
little	1
hand	1
should	1
stir	1
my	1
tea."	1
	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna	1
assented	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
spoon	1
which	1
someone	1
meanwhile	1
had	1
pounced	1
on.	1
	1
"Use	1
your	1
finger,	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
nicer,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Too	1
hot!"	1
she	1
replied,	1
blushing	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
	1
Ilyin	1
put	1
a	1
few	1
drops	1
of	1
rum	1
into	1
the	1
bucket	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna,	1
asking	1
her	1
to	1
stir	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
finger.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
cup,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Only	1
dip	1
your	1
finger	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
I'll	1
drink	1
it	1
all	1
up."	1
	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
emptied	1
the	1
samovar,	1
Rostov	1
took	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
cards	1
and	1
proposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
play	1
"Kings"	1
with	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna.	1
They	1
drew	1
lots	1
to	1
settle	1
who	1
should	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
set.	1
At	1
Rostov's	1
suggestion	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
whoever	1
became	1
"King"	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
kiss	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna's	1
hand,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
"Booby"	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
refill	1
and	1
reheat	1
the	1
samovar	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
awoke.	1
	1
"Well,	1
but	1
supposing	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna	1
is	1
'King'?"	1
asked	1
Ilyin.	1
	1
"As	1
it	1
is,	1
she	1
is	1
Queen,	1
and	1
her	1
word	1
is	1
law!"	1
	1
They	1
had	1
hardly	1
begun	1
to	1
play	1
before	1
the	1
doctor's	1
disheveled	1
head	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
from	1
behind	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
awake	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said,	1
and	1
evidently	1
found	1
nothing	1
entertaining	1
or	1
amusing	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
sad	1
and	1
depressed.	1
Without	1
greeting	1
the	1
officers,	1
he	1
scratched	1
himself	1
and	1
asked	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
blocking	1
the	1
way.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
all	1
the	1
officers	1
burst	1
into	1
loud	1
laughter	1
and	1
Mary	1
Hendrikhovna	1
blushed	1
till	1
her	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
and	1
thereby	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
attractive	1
to	1
them.	1
Returning	1
from	1
the	1
yard,	1
the	1
doctor	1
told	1
his	1
wife	1
(who	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
smile	1
so	1
happily,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
alarm,	1
awaiting	1
her	1
sentence)	1
that	1
the	1
rain	1
had	1
ceased	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
their	1
covered	1
cart,	1
or	1
everything	1
in	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
stolen.	1
	1
"But	1
I'll	1
send	1
an	1
orderly....	1
Two	1
of	1
them!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"What	1
an	1
idea,	1
doctor!"	1
	1
"I'll	1
stand	1
guard	1
on	1
it	1
myself!"	1
said	1
Ilyin.	1
	1
"No,	1
gentlemen,	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
your	1
sleep,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
slept	1
for	1
two	1
nights,"	1
replied	1
the	1
doctor,	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
morosely	1
beside	1
his	1
wife,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
game	1
to	1
end.	1
	1
Seeing	1
his	1
gloomy	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
frowned	1
at	1
his	1
wife,	1
the	1
officers	1
grew	1
still	1
merrier,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
laughter,	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
hurriedly	1
sought	1
plausible	1
pretexts.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
gone,	1
taking	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
had	1
settled	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
their	1
covered	1
cart,	1
the	1
officers	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
tavern,	1
covering	1
themselves	1
with	1
their	1
wet	1
cloaks,	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time;	1
now	1
they	1
exchanged	1
remarks,	1
recalling	1
the	1
doctor's	1
uneasiness	1
and	1
his	1
wife's	1
delight,	1
now	1
they	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
reported	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
covered	1
trap.	1
Several	1
times	1
Rostov,	1
covering	1
his	1
head,	1
tried	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep,	1
but	1
some	1
remark	1
would	1
arouse	1
him	1
and	1
conversation	1
would	1
be	1
resumed,	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
unreasoning,	1
merry,	1
childlike	1
laughter.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
three	1
o'clock	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
yet	1
asleep,	1
when	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
appeared	1
with	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
town	1
of	1
Ostrovna.	1
Still	1
laughing	1
and	1
talking,	1
the	1
officers	1
began	1
hurriedly	1
getting	1
ready	1
and	1
again	1
boiled	1
some	1
muddy	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
samovar.	1
But	1
Rostov	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
squadron	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
tea.	1
Day	1
was	1
breaking,	1
the	1
rain	1
had	1
ceased,	1
and	1
the	1
clouds	1
were	1
dispersing.	1
It	1
felt	1
damp	1
and	1
cold,	1
especially	1
in	1
clothes	1
that	1
were	1
still	1
moist.	1
As	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
tavern	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
of	1
the	1
dawn,	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Ilyin	1
both	1
glanced	1
under	1
the	1
wet	1
and	1
glistening	1
leather	1
hood	1
of	1
the	1
doctor's	1
cart,	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
apron	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
sticking	1
out,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
wife's	1
nightcap	1
was	1
visible	1
and	1
her	1
sleepy	1
breathing	1
audible.	1
	1
"She	1
really	1
is	1
a	1
dear	1
little	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
to	1
Ilyin,	1
who	1
was	1
following	1
him.	1
	1
"A	1
charming	1
woman!"	1
said	1
Ilyin,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
sixteen.	1
	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
the	1
squadron	1
was	1
lined	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
command	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
"mount"	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
crossed	1
themselves	1
and	1
mounted.	1
Rostov	1
riding	1
in	1
front	1
gave	1
the	1
order	1
"Forward!"	1
and	1
the	1
hussars,	1
with	1
clanking	1
sabers	1
and	1
subdued	1
talk,	1
their	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
splashing	1
in	1
the	1
mud,	1
defiled	1
in	1
fours	1
and	1
moved	1
along	1
the	1
broad	1
road	1
planted	1
with	1
birch	1
trees	1
on	1
each	1
side,	1
following	1
the	1
infantry	1
and	1
a	1
battery	1
that	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
in	1
front.	1
	1
Tattered,	1
blue-purple	1
clouds,	1
reddening	1
in	1
the	1
east,	1
were	1
scudding	1
before	1
the	1
wind.	1
It	1
was	1
growing	1
lighter	1
and	1
lighter.	1
That	1
curly	1
grass	1
which	1
always	1
grows	1
by	1
country	1
roadsides	1
became	1
clearly	1
visible,	1
still	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
night's	1
rain;	1
the	1
drooping	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
birches,	1
also	1
wet,	1
swayed	1
in	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
flung	1
down	1
bright	1
drops	1
of	1
water	1
to	1
one	1
side.	1
The	1
soldiers'	1
faces	1
were	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
clearly	1
visible.	1
Rostov,	1
always	1
closely	1
followed	1
by	1
Ilyin,	1
rode	1
along	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
between	1
two	1
rows	1
of	1
birch	1
trees.	1
	1
When	1
campaigning,	1
Rostov	1
allowed	1
himself	1
the	1
indulgence	1
of	1
riding	1
not	1
a	1
regimental	1
but	1
a	1
Cossack	1
horse.	1
A	1
judge	1
of	1
horses	1
and	1
a	1
sportsman,	1
he	1
had	1
lately	1
procured	1
himself	1
a	1
large,	1
fine,	1
mettlesome,	1
Donets	1
horse,	1
dun-colored,	1
with	1
light	1
mane	1
and	1
tail,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
rode	1
it	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
outgallop	1
him.	1
To	1
ride	1
this	1
horse	1
was	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
horse,	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
of	1
the	1
doctor's	1
wife,	1
but	1
not	1
once	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
danger.	1
	1
Formerly,	1
when	1
going	1
into	1
action,	1
Rostov	1
had	1
felt	1
afraid;	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
feeling	1
of	1
fear.	1
He	1
was	1
fearless,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
used	1
to	1
being	1
under	1
fire	1
(one	1
cannot	1
grow	1
used	1
to	1
danger),	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
how	1
to	1
manage	1
his	1
thoughts	1
when	1
in	1
danger.	1
He	1
had	1
grown	1
accustomed	1
when	1
going	1
into	1
action	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
anything	1
but	1
what	1
would	1
seem	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
interest	1
him--the	1
impending	1
danger.	1
During	1
the	1
first	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
service,	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
tried	1
and	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
reproached	1
himself	1
with	1
cowardice,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
this,	1
but	1
with	1
time	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
of	1
itself.	1
Now	1
he	1
rode	1
beside	1
Ilyin	1
under	1
the	1
birch	1
trees,	1
occasionally	1
plucking	1
leaves	1
from	1
a	1
branch	1
that	1
met	1
his	1
hand,	1
sometimes	1
touching	1
his	1
horse's	1
side	1
with	1
his	1
foot,	1
or,	1
without	1
turning	1
round,	1
handing	1
a	1
pipe	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
to	1
an	1
hussar	1
riding	1
behind	1
him,	1
with	1
as	1
calm	1
and	1
careless	1
an	1
air	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
merely	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
ride.	1
He	1
glanced	1
with	1
pity	1
at	1
the	1
excited	1
face	1
of	1
Ilyin,	1
who	1
talked	1
much	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
agitation.	1
He	1
knew	1
from	1
experience	1
the	1
tormenting	1
expectation	1
of	1
terror	1
and	1
death	1
the	1
cornet	1
was	1
suffering	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
only	1
time	1
could	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
appeared	1
in	1
a	1
clear	1
strip	1
of	1
sky	1
beneath	1
the	1
clouds,	1
the	1
wind	1
fell,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
dared	1
not	1
spoil	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1
storm;	1
drops	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
fall,	1
but	1
vertically	1
now,	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
still.	1
The	1
whole	1
sun	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
horizon	1
and	1
disappeared	1
behind	1
a	1
long	1
narrow	1
cloud	1
that	1
hung	1
above	1
it.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
it	1
reappeared	1
brighter	1
still	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
tearing	1
its	1
edge.	1
Everything	1
grew	1
bright	1
and	1
glittered.	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
light,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
it,	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
guns	1
ahead	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
Before	1
Rostov	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
and	1
determine	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
that	1
firing,	1
Count	1
Ostermann-Tolstoy's	1
adjutant	1
came	1
galloping	1
from	1
Vitebsk	1
with	1
orders	1
to	1
advance	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
along	1
the	1
road.	1
	1
The	1
squadron	1
overtook	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
infantry	1
and	1
the	1
battery--which	1
had	1
also	1
quickened	1
their	1
pace--rode	1
down	1
a	1
hill,	1
and	1
passing	1
through	1
an	1
empty	1
and	1
deserted	1
village	1
again	1
ascended.	1
The	1
horses	1
began	1
to	1
lather	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
flush.	1
	1
"Halt!	1
Dress	1
your	1
ranks!"	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
was	1
heard	1
ahead.	1
"Forward	1
by	1
the	1
left.	1
Walk,	1
march!"	1
came	1
the	1
order	1
from	1
in	1
front.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
hussars,	1
passing	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
our	1
position,	1
halted	1
behind	1
our	1
uhlans	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line.	1
To	1
the	1
right	1
stood	1
our	1
infantry	1
in	1
a	1
dense	1
column:	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
reserve.	1
Higher	1
up	1
the	1
hill,	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
horizon,	1
our	1
guns	1
were	1
visible	1
through	1
the	1
wonderfully	1
clear	1
air,	1
brightly	1
illuminated	1
by	1
slanting	1
morning	1
sunbeams.	1
In	1
front,	1
beyond	1
a	1
hollow	1
dale,	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
the	1
enemy's	1
columns	1
and	1
guns.	1
Our	1
advanced	1
line,	1
already	1
in	1
action,	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
briskly	1
exchanging	1
shots	1
with	1
the	1
enemy	1
in	1
the	1
dale.	1
	1
At	1
these	1
sounds,	1
long	1
unheard,	1
Rostov's	1
spirits	1
rose,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
merriest	1
music.	1
Trap-ta-ta-tap!	1
cracked	1
the	1
shots,	1
now	1
together,	1
now	1
several	1
quickly	1
one	1
after	1
another.	1
Again	1
all	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
it	1
sounded	1
as	1
if	1
someone	1
were	1
walking	1
on	1
detonators	1
and	1
exploding	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
hussars	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
for	1
about	1
an	1
hour.	1
A	1
cannonade	1
began.	1
Count	1
Ostermann	1
with	1
his	1
suite	1
rode	1
up	1
behind	1
the	1
squadron,	1
halted,	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment,	1
and	1
rode	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
the	1
guns.	1
	1
After	1
Ostermann	1
had	1
gone,	1
a	1
command	1
rang	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
uhlans.	1
	1
"Form	1
column!	1
Prepare	1
to	1
charge!"	1
	1
The	1
infantry	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
parted	1
into	1
platoons	1
to	1
allow	1
the	1
cavalry	1
to	1
pass.	1
The	1
uhlans	1
started,	1
the	1
streamers	1
on	1
their	1
spears	1
fluttering,	1
and	1
trotted	1
downhill	1
toward	1
the	1
French	1
cavalry	1
which	1
was	1
seen	1
below	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
uhlans	1
descended	1
the	1
hill,	1
the	1
hussars	1
were	1
ordered	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
battery.	1
As	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
places	1
vacated	1
by	1
the	1
uhlans,	1
bullets	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
front,	1
whining	1
and	1
whistling,	1
but	1
fell	1
spent	1
without	1
taking	1
effect.	1
	1
The	1
sounds,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
for	1
so	1
long,	1
had	1
an	1
even	1
more	1
pleasurable	1
and	1
exhilarating	1
effect	1
on	1
Rostov	1
than	1
the	1
previous	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing.	1
Drawing	1
himself	1
up,	1
he	1
viewed	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
opening	1
out	1
before	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
followed	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
uhlans.	1
They	1
swooped	1
down	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
dragoons,	1
something	1
confused	1
happened	1
there	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
five	1
minutes	1
later	1
our	1
uhlans	1
were	1
galloping	1
back,	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
they	1
had	1
occupied	1
but	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
orange-colored	1
uhlans	1
on	1
chestnut	1
horses	1
and	1
behind	1
them,	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
group,	1
blue	1
French	1
dragoons	1
on	1
gray	1
horses	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
his	1
keen	1
sportsman's	1
eye,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
catch	1
sight	1
of	1
these	1
blue	1
French	1
dragoons	1
pursuing	1
our	1
uhlans.	1
Nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
in	1
disorderly	1
crowds	1
came	1
the	1
uhlans	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
dragoons	1
pursuing	1
them.	1
He	1
could	1
already	1
see	1
how	1
these	1
men,	1
who	1
looked	1
so	1
small	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
jostled	1
and	1
overtook	1
one	1
another,	1
waving	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
their	1
sabers	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
Rostov	1
gazed	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
hunt.	1
He	1
felt	1
instinctively	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
hussars	1
struck	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
dragoons	1
now,	1
the	1
latter	1
could	1
not	1
withstand	1
them,	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
charge	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
now,	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment,	1
or	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
late.	1
He	1
looked	1
around.	1
A	1
captain,	1
standing	1
beside	1
him,	1
was	1
gazing	1
like	1
himself	1
with	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
cavalry	1
below	1
them.	1
	1
"Andrew	1
Sevastyanych!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"You	1
know,	1
we	1
could	1
crush	1
them...."	1
	1
"A	1
fine	1
thing	1
too!"	1
replied	1
the	1
captain,	1
"and	1
really..."	1
	1
Rostov,	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
out,	1
touched	1
his	1
horse,	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
squadron,	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
giving	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
the	1
whole	1
squadron,	1
sharing	1
his	1
feeling,	1
was	1
following	1
him.	1
Rostov	1
himself	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
or	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
it.	1
He	1
acted	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
when	1
hunting,	1
without	1
reflecting	1
or	1
considering.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
dragoons	1
near	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
galloping	1
in	1
disorder;	1
he	1
knew	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
withstand	1
an	1
attack--knew	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
that	1
moment	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
let	1
it	1
slip	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
return.	1
The	1
bullets	1
were	1
whining	1
and	1
whistling	1
so	1
stimulatingly	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
horse	1
was	1
so	1
eager	1
to	1
go	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
himself.	1
He	1
touched	1
his	1
horse,	1
gave	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
and	1
immediately,	1
hearing	1
behind	1
him	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
of	1
his	1
deployed	1
squadron,	1
rode	1
at	1
full	1
trot	1
downhill	1
toward	1
the	1
dragoons.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
before	1
their	1
pace	1
instinctively	1
changed	1
to	1
a	1
gallop,	1
which	1
grew	1
faster	1
and	1
faster	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
our	1
uhlans	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
dragoons	1
who	1
galloped	1
after	1
them.	1
The	1
dragoons	1
were	1
now	1
close	1
at	1
hand.	1
On	1
seeing	1
the	1
hussars,	1
the	1
foremost	1
began	1
to	1
turn,	1
while	1
those	1
behind	1
began	1
to	1
halt.	1
With	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
galloped	1
across	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
a	1
wolf,	1
Rostov	1
gave	1
rein	1
to	1
his	1
Donets	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
to	1
intersect	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
dragoons'	1
disordered	1
lines.	1
One	1
Uhlan	1
stopped,	1
another	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
foot	1
flung	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
knocked	1
over,	1
and	1
a	1
riderless	1
horse	1
fell	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
hussars.	1
Nearly	1
all	1
the	1
French	1
dragoons	1
were	1
galloping	1
back.	1
Rostov,	1
picking	1
out	1
one	1
on	1
a	1
gray	1
horse,	1
dashed	1
after	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
bush,	1
his	1
gallant	1
horse	1
cleared	1
it,	1
and	1
almost	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
righted	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
saddle	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
immediately	1
overtake	1
the	1
enemy	1
he	1
had	1
selected.	1
That	1
Frenchman,	1
by	1
his	1
uniform	1
an	1
officer,	1
was	1
going	1
at	1
a	1
gallop,	1
crouching	1
on	1
his	1
gray	1
horse	1
and	1
urging	1
it	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
saber.	1
In	1
another	1
moment	1
Rostov's	1
horse	1
dashed	1
its	1
breast	1
against	1
the	1
hindquarters	1
of	1
the	1
officer's	1
horse,	1
almost	1
knocking	1
it	1
over,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
Rostov,	1
without	1
knowing	1
why,	1
raised	1
his	1
saber	1
and	1
struck	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
instant	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
this,	1
all	1
Rostov's	1
animation	1
vanished.	1
The	1
officer	1
fell,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
the	1
blow--which	1
had	1
but	1
slightly	1
cut	1
his	1
arm	1
above	1
the	1
elbow--as	1
from	1
the	1
shock	1
to	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
from	1
fright.	1
Rostov	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
sought	1
his	1
foe	1
to	1
see	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
vanquished.	1
The	1
French	1
dragoon	1
officer	1
was	1
hopping	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
the	1
other	1
being	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
stirrup.	1
His	1
eyes,	1
screwed	1
up	1
with	1
fear	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
every	1
moment	1
expected	1
another	1
blow,	1
gazed	1
up	1
at	1
Rostov	1
with	1
shrinking	1
terror.	1
His	1
pale	1
and	1
mud-stained	1
face--fair	1
and	1
young,	1
with	1
a	1
dimple	1
in	1
the	1
chin	1
and	1
light-blue	1
eyes--was	1
not	1
an	1
enemy's	1
face	1
at	1
all	1
suited	1
to	1
a	1
battlefield,	1
but	1
a	1
most	1
ordinary,	1
homelike	1
face.	1
Before	1
Rostov	1
had	1
decided	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
officer	1
cried,	1
"I	1
surrender!"	1
He	1
hurriedly	1
but	1
vainly	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
foot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stirrup	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
remove	1
his	1
frightened	1
blue	1
eyes	1
from	1
Rostov's	1
face.	1
Some	1
hussars	1
who	1
galloped	1
up	1
disengaged	1
his	1
foot	1
and	1
helped	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
saddle.	1
On	1
all	1
sides,	1
the	1
hussars	1
were	1
busy	1
with	1
the	1
dragoons;	1
one	1
was	1
wounded,	1
but	1
though	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
bleeding,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
his	1
horse;	1
another	1
was	1
perched	1
up	1
behind	1
an	1
hussar	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
him;	1
a	1
third	1
was	1
being	1
helped	1
by	1
an	1
hussar	1
to	1
mount	1
his	1
horse.	1
In	1
front,	1
the	1
French	1
infantry	1
were	1
firing	1
as	1
they	1
ran.	1
The	1
hussars	1
galloped	1
hastily	1
back	1
with	1
their	1
prisoners.	1
Rostov	1
galloped	1
back	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
aware	1
of	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
feeling	1
of	1
depression	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
Something	1
vague	1
and	1
confused,	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
account	1
for,	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
that	1
officer	1
and	1
the	1
blow	1
he	1
had	1
dealt	1
him.	1
	1
Count	1
Ostermann-Tolstoy	1
met	1
the	1
returning	1
hussars,	1
sent	1
for	1
Rostov,	1
thanked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
report	1
his	1
gallant	1
deed	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
would	1
recommend	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
St.	1
George's	1
Cross.	1
When	1
sent	1
for	1
by	1
Count	1
Ostermann,	1
Rostov,	1
remembering	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
charged	1
without	1
orders,	1
felt	1
sure	1
his	1
commander	1
was	1
sending	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
breach	1
of	1
discipline.	1
Ostermann's	1
flattering	1
words	1
and	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
reward	1
should	1
therefore	1
have	1
struck	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
pleasantly,	1
but	1
he	1
still	1
felt	1
that	1
same	1
vaguely	1
disagreeable	1
feeling	1
of	1
moral	1
nausea.	1
"But	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
is	1
worrying	1
me?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
general.	1
"Ilyin?	1
No,	1
he's	1
safe.	1
Have	1
I	1
disgraced	1
myself	1
in	1
any	1
way?	1
No,	1
that's	1
not	1
it."	1
Something	1
else,	1
resembling	1
remorse,	1
tormented	1
him.	1
"Yes,	1
oh	1
yes,	1
that	1
French	1
officer	1
with	1
the	1
dimple.	1
And	1
I	1
remember	1
how	1
my	1
arm	1
paused	1
when	1
I	1
raised	1
it."	1
	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
prisoners	1
being	1
led	1
away	1
and	1
galloped	1
after	1
them	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
the	1
dimple	1
on	1
his	1
chin.	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
his	1
foreign	1
uniform	1
on	1
an	1
hussar	1
packhorse	1
and	1
looked	1
anxiously	1
about	1
him;	1
The	1
sword	1
cut	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
could	1
scarcely	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
wound.	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
Rostov	1
with	1
a	1
feigned	1
smile	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
greeting.	1
Rostov	1
still	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
indefinite	1
feeling,	1
as	1
of	1
shame.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
comrades	1
noticed	1
that	1
Rostov,	1
without	1
being	1
dull	1
or	1
angry,	1
was	1
silent,	1
thoughtful,	1
and	1
preoccupied.	1
He	1
drank	1
reluctantly,	1
tried	1
to	1
remain	1
alone,	1
and	1
kept	1
turning	1
something	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
Rostov	1
was	1
always	1
thinking	1
about	1
that	1
brilliant	1
exploit	1
of	1
his,	1
which	1
to	1
his	1
amazement	1
had	1
gained	1
him	1
the	1
St.	1
George's	1
Cross	1
and	1
even	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
reputation	1
for	1
bravery,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
understand.	1
"So	1
others	1
are	1
even	1
more	1
afraid	1
than	1
I	1
am!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"So	1
that's	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
heroism!	1
And	1
did	1
I	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
country's	1
sake?	1
And	1
how	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
blame,	1
with	1
his	1
dimple	1
and	1
blue	1
eyes?	1
And	1
how	1
frightened	1
he	1
was!	1
He	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
kill	1
him.	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
kill	1
him?	1
My	1
hand	1
trembled.	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
St.	1
George's	1
Cross....	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
But	1
while	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
considering	1
these	1
questions	1
and	1
still	1
could	1
reach	1
no	1
clear	1
solution	1
of	1
what	1
puzzled	1
him	1
so,	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
fortune	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
as	1
often	1
happens,	1
turned	1
in	1
his	1
favor.	1
After	1
the	1
affair	1
at	1
Ostrovna	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
notice,	1
received	1
command	1
of	1
an	1
hussar	1
battalion,	1
and	1
when	1
a	1
brave	1
officer	1
was	1
needed	1
he	1
was	1
chosen.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
On	1
receiving	1
news	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
illness,	1
the	1
countess,	1
though	1
not	1
quite	1
well	1
yet	1
and	1
still	1
weak,	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
with	1
Petya	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
moved	1
from	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
house	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
and	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
town.	1
	1
Natasha's	1
illness	1
was	1
so	1
serious	1
that,	1
fortunately	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
parents,	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
illness,	1
her	1
conduct	1
and	1
the	1
breaking	1
off	1
of	1
her	1
engagement,	1
receded	1
into	1
the	1
background.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
ill	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
consider	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
what	1
had	1
happened.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
eat	1
or	1
sleep,	1
grew	1
visibly	1
thinner,	1
coughed,	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
doctors	1
made	1
them	1
feel,	1
was	1
in	1
danger.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
but	1
how	1
to	1
help	1
her.	1
Doctors	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
singly	1
and	1
in	1
consultation,	1
talked	1
much	1
in	1
French,	1
German,	1
and	1
Latin,	1
blamed	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
prescribed	1
a	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
medicines	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
diseases	1
known	1
to	1
them,	1
but	1
the	1
simple	1
idea	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
disease	1
Natasha	1
was	1
suffering	1
from,	1
as	1
no	1
disease	1
suffered	1
by	1
a	1
live	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
known,	1
for	1
every	1
living	1
person	1
has	1
his	1
own	1
peculiarities	1
and	1
always	1
has	1
his	1
own	1
peculiar,	1
personal,	1
novel,	1
complicated	1
disease,	1
unknown	1
to	1
medicine--not	1
a	1
disease	1
of	1
the	1
lungs,	1
liver,	1
skin,	1
heart,	1
nerves,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
mentioned	1
in	1
medical	1
books,	1
but	1
a	1
disease	1
consisting	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
combinations	1
of	1
the	1
maladies	1
of	1
those	1
organs.	1
This	1
simple	1
thought	1
could	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
the	1
doctors	1
(as	1
it	1
cannot	1
occur	1
to	1
a	1
wizard	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
unable	1
to	1
work	1
his	1
charms)	1
because	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
was	1
to	1
cure,	1
and	1
they	1
received	1
money	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
best	1
years	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
on	1
that	1
business.	1
But,	1
above	1
all,	1
that	1
thought	1
was	1
kept	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
minds	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
they	1
saw	1
they	1
were	1
really	1
useful,	1
as	1
in	1
fact	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
Rostov	1
family.	1
Their	1
usefulness	1
did	1
not	1
depend	1
on	1
making	1
the	1
patient	1
swallow	1
substances	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
harmful	1
(the	1
harm	1
was	1
scarcely	1
perceptible,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
given	1
in	1
small	1
doses),	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
useful,	1
necessary,	1
and	1
indispensable	1
because	1
they	1
satisfied	1
a	1
mental	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
invalid	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
loved	1
her--and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
there	1
are,	1
and	1
always	1
will	1
be,	1
pseudo-healers,	1
wise	1
women,	1
homeopaths,	1
and	1
allopaths.	1
They	1
satisfied	1
that	1
eternal	1
human	1
need	1
for	1
hope	1
of	1
relief,	1
for	1
sympathy,	1
and	1
that	1
something	1
should	1
be	1
done,	1
which	1
is	1
felt	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
suffering.	1
They	1
satisfied	1
the	1
need	1
seen	1
in	1
its	1
most	1
elementary	1
form	1
in	1
a	1
child,	1
when	1
it	1
wants	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
place	1
rubbed	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
hurt.	1
A	1
child	1
knocks	1
itself	1
and	1
runs	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
its	1
mother	1
or	1
nurse	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
aching	1
spot	1
rubbed	1
or	1
kissed,	1
and	1
it	1
feels	1
better	1
when	1
this	1
is	1
done.	1
The	1
child	1
cannot	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
strongest	1
and	1
wisest	1
of	1
its	1
people	1
have	1
no	1
remedy	1
for	1
its	1
pain,	1
and	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
relief	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
its	1
mother's	1
sympathy	1
while	1
she	1
rubs	1
the	1
bump	1
comforts	1
it.	1
The	1
doctors	1
were	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
Natasha	1
because	1
they	1
kissed	1
and	1
rubbed	1
her	1
bump,	1
assuring	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
soon	1
pass	1
if	1
only	1
the	1
coachman	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
chemist's	1
in	1
the	1
Arbat	1
and	1
got	1
a	1
powder	1
and	1
some	1
pills	1
in	1
a	1
pretty	1
box	1
for	1
a	1
ruble	1
and	1
seventy	1
kopeks,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
took	1
those	1
powders	1
in	1
boiled	1
water	1
at	1
intervals	1
of	1
precisely	1
two	1
hours,	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less.	1
	1
What	1
would	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
have	1
done,	1
how	1
would	1
they	1
have	1
looked,	1
if	1
nothing	1
had	1
been	1
done,	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
those	1
pills	1
to	1
give	1
by	1
the	1
clock,	1
the	1
warm	1
drinks,	1
the	1
chicken	1
cutlets,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
details	1
of	1
life	1
ordered	1
by	1
the	1
doctors,	1
the	1
carrying	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
supplied	1
an	1
occupation	1
and	1
consolation	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
circle?	1
How	1
would	1
the	1
count	1
have	1
borne	1
his	1
dearly	1
loved	1
daughter's	1
illness	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
known	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
costing	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
rubles,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
grudge	1
thousands	1
more	1
to	1
benefit	1
her,	1
or	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
known	1
that	1
if	1
her	1
illness	1
continued	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
grudge	1
yet	1
other	1
thousands	1
and	1
would	1
take	1
her	1
abroad	1
for	1
consultations	1
there,	1
and	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
how	1
Metivier	1
and	1
Feller	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
the	1
symptoms,	1
but	1
Frise	1
had,	1
and	1
Mudrov	1
had	1
diagnosed	1
them	1
even	1
better?	1
What	1
would	1
the	1
countess	1
have	1
done	1
had	1
she	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
sometimes	1
to	1
scold	1
the	1
invalid	1
for	1
not	1
strictly	1
obeying	1
the	1
doctor's	1
orders?	1
	1
"You'll	1
never	1
get	1
well	1
like	1
that,"	1
she	1
would	1
say,	1
forgetting	1
her	1
grief	1
in	1
her	1
vexation,	1
"if	1
you	1
won't	1
obey	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
medicine	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time!	1
You	1
mustn't	1
trifle	1
with	1
it,	1
you	1
know,	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
turn	1
to	1
pneumonia,"	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
on,	1
deriving	1
much	1
comfort	1
from	1
the	1
utterance	1
of	1
that	1
foreign	1
word,	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
others	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
herself.	1
	1
What	1
would	1
Sonya	1
have	1
done	1
without	1
the	1
glad	1
consciousness	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
undressed	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
three	1
nights,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
doctor's	1
injunctions	1
with	1
precision,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
still	1
kept	1
awake	1
at	1
night	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
slightly	1
harmful	1
pills	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
gilt	1
box	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
administered?	1
Even	1
to	1
Natasha	1
herself	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
so	1
many	1
sacrifices	1
were	1
being	1
made	1
for	1
her	1
sake,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
medicine	1
at	1
certain	1
hours,	1
though	1
she	1
declared	1
that	1
no	1
medicine	1
would	1
cure	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
nonsense.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
pleasant	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
show,	1
by	1
disregarding	1
the	1
orders,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
medical	1
treatment	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
value	1
her	1
life.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
came	1
every	1
day,	1
felt	1
her	1
pulse,	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
tongue,	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
her	1
grief-stricken	1
face	1
joked	1
with	1
her.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
another	1
room,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
countess	1
hurriedly	1
followed	1
him,	1
he	1
assumed	1
a	1
grave	1
air	1
and	1
thoughtfully	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
said	1
that	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
danger,	1
he	1
had	1
hopes	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
this	1
last	1
medicine	1
and	1
one	1
must	1
wait	1
and	1
see,	1
that	1
the	1
malady	1
was	1
chiefly	1
mental,	1
but...	1
And	1
the	1
countess,	1
trying	1
to	1
conceal	1
the	1
action	1
from	1
herself	1
and	1
from	1
him,	1
slipped	1
a	1
gold	1
coin	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
always	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
patient	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
tranquil	1
mind.	1
	1
The	1
symptoms	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
illness	1
were	1
that	1
she	1
ate	1
little,	1
slept	1
little,	1
coughed,	1
and	1
was	1
always	1
low-spirited.	1
The	1
doctors	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
on	1
without	1
medical	1
treatment,	1
so	1
they	1
kept	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
stifling	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
that	1
summer	1
of	1
1812.	1
	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
pills	1
she	1
swallowed	1
and	1
the	1
drops	1
and	1
powders	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
bottles	1
and	1
boxes	1
of	1
which	1
Madame	1
Schoss	1
who	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
made	1
a	1
large	1
collection,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
being	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
life	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
accustomed,	1
youth	1
prevailed.	1
Natasha's	1
grief	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
overlaid	1
by	1
the	1
impressions	1
of	1
daily	1
life,	1
it	1
ceased	1
to	1
press	1
so	1
painfully	1
on	1
her	1
heart,	1
it	1
gradually	1
faded	1
into	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
recover	1
physically.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
calmer	1
but	1
no	1
happier.	1
She	1
not	1
merely	1
avoided	1
all	1
external	1
forms	1
of	1
pleasure--balls,	1
promenades,	1
concerts,	1
and	1
theaters--but	1
she	1
never	1
laughed	1
without	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
laughter.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
sing.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
laugh,	1
or	1
tried	1
to	1
sing	1
by	1
herself,	1
tears	1
choked	1
her:	1
tears	1
of	1
remorse,	1
tears	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
those	1
pure	1
times	1
which	1
could	1
never	1
return,	1
tears	1
of	1
vexation	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
so	1
uselessly	1
have	1
ruined	1
her	1
young	1
life	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
happy.	1
Laughter	1
and	1
singing	1
in	1
particular	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
blasphemy,	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
her	1
sorrow.	1
Without	1
any	1
need	1
of	1
self-restraint,	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
coquet	1
ever	1
entered	1
her	1
head.	1
She	1
said	1
and	1
felt	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
more	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
Nastasya	1
Ivanovna,	1
the	1
buffoon.	1
Something	1
stood	1
sentinel	1
within	1
her	1
and	1
forbade	1
her	1
every	1
joy.	1
Besides,	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
interests	1
of	1
her	1
carefree	1
girlish	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
hope.	1
The	1
previous	1
autumn,	1
the	1
hunting,	1
"Uncle,"	1
and	1
the	1
Christmas	1
holidays	1
spent	1
with	1
Nicholas	1
at	1
Otradnoe	1
were	1
what	1
she	1
recalled	1
oftenest	1
and	1
most	1
painfully.	1
What	1
would	1
she	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
bring	1
back	1
even	1
a	1
single	1
day	1
of	1
that	1
time!	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
gone	1
forever.	1
Her	1
presentiment	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
not	1
deceived	1
her--that	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
readiness	1
for	1
any	1
enjoyment	1
would	1
not	1
return	1
again.	1
Yet	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
live	1
on.	1
	1
It	1
comforted	1
her	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
better	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
formerly	1
imagined,	1
but	1
worse,	1
much	1
worse,	1
than	1
anybody	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
enough.	1
She	1
knew	1
that,	1
and	1
asked	1
herself,	1
"What	1
next?"	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
come.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
joy	1
in	1
life,	1
yet	1
life	1
was	1
passing.	1
Natasha	1
apparently	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
burden	1
or	1
a	1
hindrance	1
to	1
anyone,	1
but	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
for	1
herself.	1
She	1
kept	1
away	1
from	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
felt	1
at	1
ease	1
only	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
Petya.	1
She	1
liked	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
him	1
better	1
than	1
with	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
when	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
sometimes	1
laughed.	1
She	1
hardly	1
ever	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
only	1
one	1
person,	1
Pierre.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impossible	1
to	1
treat	1
her	1
with	1
more	1
delicacy,	1
greater	1
care,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
more	1
seriously	1
than	1
did	1
Count	1
Bezukhov.	1
Natasha	1
unconsciously	1
felt	1
this	1
delicacy	1
and	1
so	1
found	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
his	1
society.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
grateful	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
it;	1
nothing	1
good	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
part	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
effort,	1
it	1
seemed	1
so	1
natural	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
kind	1
to	1
everyone	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
merit	1
in	1
his	1
kindness.	1
Sometimes	1
Natasha	1
noticed	1
embarrassment	1
and	1
awkwardness	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
in	1
her	1
presence,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
to	1
please	1
her,	1
or	1
feared	1
that	1
something	1
they	1
spoke	1
of	1
would	1
awaken	1
memories	1
distressing	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
noticed	1
this	1
and	1
attributed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
general	1
kindness	1
and	1
shyness,	1
which	1
she	1
imagined	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
toward	1
everyone	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
her.	1
After	1
those	1
involuntary	1
words--that	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
free	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
asked	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
for	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
her	1
love--uttered	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
strongly	1
agitated,	1
Pierre	1
never	1
spoke	1
to	1
Natasha	1
of	1
his	1
feelings;	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
plain	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
those	1
words,	1
which	1
had	1
then	1
so	1
comforted	1
her,	1
were	1
spoken	1
as	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
meaningless	1
words	1
are	1
spoken	1
to	1
comfort	1
a	1
crying	1
child.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
because	1
Pierre	1
was	1
a	1
married	1
man,	1
but	1
because	1
Natasha	1
felt	1
very	1
strongly	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
moral	1
barrier	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
experienced	1
with	1
Kuragin	1
that	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
her	1
head	1
that	1
the	1
relations	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
herself	1
could	1
lead	1
to	1
love	1
on	1
her	1
part,	1
still	1
less	1
on	1
his,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
tender,	1
self-conscious,	1
romantic	1
friendship	1
between	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
several	1
instances.	1
	1
Before	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
St.	1
Peter,	1
Agrafena	1
Ivanovna	1
Belova,	1
a	1
country	1
neighbor	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow	1
to	1
pay	1
her	1
devotions	1
at	1
the	1
shrines	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
saints.	1
She	1
suggested	1
that	1
Natasha	1
should	1
fast	1
and	1
prepare	1
for	1
Holy	1
Communion,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
gladly	1
welcomed	1
the	1
idea.	1
Despite	1
the	1
doctor's	1
orders	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
Natasha	1
insisted	1
on	1
fasting	1
and	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
sacrament,	1
not	1
as	1
they	1
generally	1
prepared	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
Rostov	1
family	1
by	1
attending	1
three	1
services	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
house,	1
but	1
as	1
Agrafena	1
Ivanovna	1
did,	1
by	1
going	1
to	1
church	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
and	1
not	1
once	1
missing	1
Vespers,	1
Matins,	1
or	1
Mass.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
Natasha's	1
zeal;	1
after	1
the	1
poor	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
medical	1
treatment,	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
hoped	1
that	1
prayer	1
might	1
help	1
her	1
daughter	1
more	1
than	1
medicines	1
and,	1
though	1
not	1
without	1
fear	1
and	1
concealing	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
doctor,	1
she	1
agreed	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
wish	1
and	1
entrusted	1
her	1
to	1
Belova.	1
Agrafena	1
Ivanovna	1
used	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
wake	1
Natasha	1
at	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
but	1
generally	1
found	1
her	1
already	1
awake.	1
She	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
late	1
for	1
Matins.	1
Hastily	1
washing,	1
and	1
meekly	1
putting	1
on	1
her	1
shabbiest	1
dress	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
mantilla,	1
Natasha,	1
shivering	1
in	1
the	1
fresh	1
air,	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
deserted	1
streets	1
lit	1
by	1
the	1
clear	1
light	1
of	1
dawn.	1
By	1
Agrafena	1
Ivanovna's	1
advice	1
Natasha	1
prepared	1
herself	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
parish,	1
but	1
at	1
a	1
church	1
where,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
devout	1
Agrafena	1
Ivanovna,	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
severe	1
and	1
lofty	1
life.	1
There	1
were	1
never	1
many	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
church;	1
Natasha	1
always	1
stood	1
beside	1
Belova	1
in	1
the	1
customary	1
place	1
before	1
an	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Blessed	1
Virgin,	1
let	1
into	1
the	1
screen	1
before	1
the	1
choir	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
side,	1
and	1
a	1
feeling,	1
new	1
to	1
her,	1
of	1
humility	1
before	1
something	1
great	1
and	1
incomprehensible,	1
seized	1
her	1
when	1
at	1
that	1
unusual	1
morning	1
hour,	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
dark	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin	1
illuminated	1
by	1
the	1
candles	1
burning	1
before	1
it	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
morning	1
light	1
falling	1
from	1
the	1
window,	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
which	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
follow	1
with	1
understanding.	1
When	1
she	1
understood	1
them	1
her	1
personal	1
feeling	1
became	1
interwoven	1
in	1
the	1
prayers	1
with	1
shades	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1
When	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand,	1
it	1
was	1
sweeter	1
still	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
wish	1
to	1
understand	1
everything	1
is	1
pride,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
understand	1
all,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
to	1
commit	1
oneself	1
to	1
God,	1
whom	1
she	1
felt	1
guiding	1
her	1
soul	1
at	1
those	1
moments.	1
She	1
crossed	1
herself,	1
bowed	1
low,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand,	1
in	1
horror	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
vileness,	1
simply	1
asked	1
God	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
everything,	1
everything,	1
to	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her.	1
The	1
prayers	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
surrendered	1
herself	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
repentance.	1
On	1
her	1
way	1
home	1
at	1
an	1
early	1
hour	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
bricklayers	1
going	1
to	1
work	1
or	1
men	1
sweeping	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
everybody	1
within	1
the	1
houses	1
was	1
still	1
asleep,	1
Natasha	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
new	1
to	1
her,	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
correcting	1
her	1
faults,	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1
new,	1
clean	1
life,	1
and	1
of	1
happiness.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
week	1
she	1
spent	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
that	1
feeling	1
grew	1
every	1
day.	1
And	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
taking	1
communion,	1
or	1
"communing"	1
as	1
Agrafena	1
Ivanovna,	1
joyously	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
word,	1
called	1
it,	1
seemed	1
to	1
Natasha	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
should	1
never	1
live	1
till	1
that	1
blessed	1
Sunday.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
happy	1
day	1
came,	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
memorable	1
Sunday,	1
when,	1
dressed	1
in	1
white	1
muslin,	1
she	1
returned	1
home	1
after	1
communion,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
for	1
many	1
months	1
she	1
felt	1
calm	1
and	1
not	1
oppressed	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
her.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
that	1
day	1
ordered	1
her	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
powders	1
he	1
had	1
prescribed	1
a	1
fortnight	1
previously.	1
	1
"She	1
must	1
certainly	1
go	1
on	1
taking	1
them	1
morning	1
and	1
evening,"	1
said	1
he,	1
evidently	1
sincerely	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
success.	1
"Only,	1
please	1
be	1
particular	1
about	1
it.	1
	1
"Be	1
quite	1
easy,"	1
he	1
continued	1
playfully,	1
as	1
he	1
adroitly	1
took	1
the	1
gold	1
coin	1
in	1
his	1
palm.	1
"She	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
singing	1
and	1
frolicking	1
about.	1
The	1
last	1
medicine	1
has	1
done	1
her	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
good.	1
She	1
has	1
freshened	1
up	1
very	1
much."	1
	1
The	1
countess,	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
nails	1
and	1
spat	1
a	1
little	1
for	1
luck	1
as	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
July	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
disquieting	1
reports	1
about	1
the	1
war	1
began	1
to	1
spread	1
in	1
Moscow;	1
people	1
spoke	1
of	1
an	1
appeal	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
And	1
as	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
eleventh	1
of	1
July	1
no	1
manifesto	1
or	1
appeal	1
had	1
been	1
received,	1
exaggerated	1
reports	1
became	1
current	1
about	1
them	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Russia.	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
army	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
danger,	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
that	1
Smolensk	1
had	1
surrendered,	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
a	1
million	1
and	1
only	1
a	1
miracle	1
could	1
save	1
Russia.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
eleventh	1
of	1
July,	1
which	1
was	1
Saturday,	1
the	1
manifesto	1
was	1
received	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
in	1
print,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs',	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
next	1
day,	1
Sunday,	1
and	1
bring	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
manifesto	1
and	1
appeal,	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
obtain	1
from	1
Count	1
Rostopchin.	1
	1
That	1
Sunday,	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
went	1
to	1
Mass	1
at	1
the	1
Razumovskis'	1
private	1
chapel	1
as	1
usual.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
hot	1
July	1
day.	1
Even	1
at	1
ten	1
o'clock,	1
when	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
carriage	1
at	1
the	1
chapel,	1
the	1
sultry	1
air,	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
hawkers,	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
gay	1
summer	1
clothes	1
of	1
the	1
crowd,	1
the	1
dusty	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
on	1
the	1
boulevard,	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
trousers	1
of	1
a	1
battalion	1
marching	1
to	1
parade,	1
the	1
rattling	1
of	1
wheels	1
on	1
the	1
cobblestones,	1
and	1
the	1
brilliant,	1
hot	1
sunshine	1
were	1
all	1
full	1
of	1
that	1
summer	1
languor,	1
that	1
content	1
and	1
discontent	1
with	1
the	1
present,	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
strongly	1
felt	1
on	1
a	1
bright,	1
hot	1
day	1
in	1
town.	1
All	1
the	1
Moscow	1
notabilities,	1
all	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
acquaintances,	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
Razumovskis'	1
chapel,	1
for,	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
something	1
to	1
happen,	1
many	1
wealthy	1
families	1
who	1
usually	1
left	1
town	1
for	1
their	1
country	1
estates	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
away	1
that	1
summer.	1
As	1
Natasha,	1
at	1
her	1
mother's	1
side,	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
behind	1
a	1
liveried	1
footman	1
who	1
cleared	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
them,	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
speaking	1
about	1
her	1
in	1
too	1
loud	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
"That's	1
Rostova,	1
the	1
one	1
who..."	1
	1
"She's	1
much	1
thinner,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
she's	1
pretty!"	1
	1
She	1
heard,	1
or	1
thought	1
she	1
heard,	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Kuragin	1
and	1
Bolkonski.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
imagining	1
that.	1
It	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
everyone	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
was	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
her.	1
With	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart,	1
wretched	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
was	1
now	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
a	1
crowd,	1
Natasha	1
in	1
her	1
lilac	1
silk	1
dress	1
trimmed	1
with	1
black	1
lace	1
walked-	1
-as	1
women	1
can	1
walk--with	1
the	1
more	1
repose	1
and	1
stateliness	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
pain	1
and	1
shame	1
in	1
her	1
soul.	1
She	1
knew	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
pretty,	1
but	1
this	1
no	1
longer	1
gave	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
as	1
it	1
used	1
to.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
tormented	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
of	1
late,	1
and	1
particularly	1
so	1
on	1
this	1
bright,	1
hot	1
summer	1
day	1
in	1
town.	1
"It's	1
Sunday	1
again--another	1
week	1
past,"	1
she	1
thought,	1
recalling	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
here	1
the	1
Sunday	1
before,	1
"and	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
life	1
that	1
is	1
no	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
surroundings	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
live.	1
I'm	1
pretty,	1
I'm	1
young,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
good.	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
bad,	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
good,"	1
she	1
thought,	1
"but	1
yet	1
my	1
best	1
years	1
are	1
slipping	1
by	1
and	1
are	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
anyone."	1
She	1
stood	1
by	1
her	1
mother's	1
side	1
and	1
exchanged	1
nods	1
with	1
acquaintances	1
near	1
her.	1
From	1
habit	1
she	1
scrutinized	1
the	1
ladies'	1
dresses,	1
condemned	1
the	1
bearing	1
of	1
a	1
lady	1
standing	1
close	1
by	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
crossing	1
herself	1
properly	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
cramped	1
manner,	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
thought	1
with	1
vexation	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
being	1
judged	1
and	1
was	1
judging	1
others,	1
and	1
suddenly,	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
service,	1
she	1
felt	1
horrified	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
vileness,	1
horrified	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
purity	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
was	1
again	1
lost	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
A	1
comely,	1
fresh-looking	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
conducting	1
the	1
service	1
with	1
that	1
mild	1
solemnity	1
which	1
has	1
so	1
elevating	1
and	1
soothing	1
an	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
worshipers.	1
The	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
screen	1
were	1
closed,	1
the	1
curtain	1
was	1
slowly	1
drawn,	1
and	1
from	1
behind	1
it	1
a	1
soft	1
mysterious	1
voice	1
pronounced	1
some	1
words.	1
Tears,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
herself	1
did	1
not	1
understand,	1
made	1
Natasha's	1
breast	1
heave,	1
and	1
a	1
joyous	1
but	1
oppressive	1
feeling	1
agitated	1
her.	1
	1
"Teach	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do,	1
how	1
to	1
live	1
my	1
life,	1
how	1
I	1
may	1
grow	1
good	1
forever,	1
forever!"	1
she	1
pleaded.	1
	1
The	1
deacon	1
came	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
raised	1
space	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
screen	1
and,	1
holding	1
his	1
thumb	1
extended,	1
drew	1
his	1
long	1
hair	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
dalmatic	1
and,	1
making	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
solemn	1
voice	1
to	1
recite	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prayer...	1
	1
"In	1
peace	1
let	1
us	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord."	1
	1
"As	1
one	1
community,	1
without	1
distinction	1
of	1
class,	1
without	1
enmity,	1
united	1
by	1
brotherly	1
love--let	1
us	1
pray!"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"For	1
the	1
peace	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
our	1
souls."	1
	1
"For	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
angels	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
spirits	1
who	1
dwell	1
above	1
us,"	1
prayed	1
Natasha.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
prayed	1
for	1
the	1
warriors,	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
Denisov.	1
When	1
they	1
prayed	1
for	1
all	1
traveling	1
by	1
land	1
and	1
sea,	1
she	1
remembered	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
prayed	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
God	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
wrongs	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
him.	1
When	1
they	1
prayed	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
love	1
us,	1
she	1
prayed	1
for	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
family,	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
realizing	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
how	1
wrongly	1
she	1
had	1
acted	1
toward	1
them,	1
and	1
feeling	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
them.	1
When	1
they	1
prayed	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
hate	1
us,	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
enemies	1
and	1
people	1
who	1
hated	1
her,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
them.	1
She	1
included	1
among	1
her	1
enemies	1
the	1
creditors	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
had	1
business	1
dealings	1
with	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
always	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
enemies	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
hated	1
her	1
she	1
remembered	1
Anatole	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
harm--and	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
hate	1
her	1
she	1
gladly	1
prayed	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
for	1
an	1
enemy.	1
Only	1
at	1
prayer	1
did	1
she	1
feel	1
able	1
to	1
think	1
clearly	1
and	1
calmly	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Anatole,	1
as	1
men	1
for	1
whom	1
her	1
feelings	1
were	1
as	1
nothing	1
compared	1
with	1
her	1
awe	1
and	1
devotion	1
to	1
God.	1
When	1
they	1
prayed	1
for	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family	1
and	1
the	1
Synod,	1
she	1
bowed	1
very	1
low	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross,	1
saying	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand,	1
still	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
doubt,	1
and	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
loved	1
the	1
governing	1
Synod	1
and	1
prayed	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
Litany	1
the	1
deacon	1
crossed	1
the	1
stole	1
over	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
said,	1
"Let	1
us	1
commit	1
ourselves	1
and	1
our	1
whole	1
lives	1
to	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord!"	1
	1
"Commit	1
ourselves	1
to	1
God,"	1
Natasha	1
inwardly	1
repeated.	1
"Lord	1
God,	1
I	1
submit	1
myself	1
to	1
Thy	1
will!"	1
she	1
thought.	1
"I	1
want	1
nothing,	1
wish	1
for	1
nothing;	1
teach	1
me	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
how	1
to	1
use	1
my	1
will!	1
Take	1
me,	1
take	1
me!"	1
prayed	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
impatient	1
emotion	1
in	1
her	1
heart,	1
not	1
crossing	1
herself	1
but	1
letting	1
her	1
slender	1
arms	1
hang	1
down	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
some	1
invisible	1
power	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
and	1
deliver	1
her	1
from	1
herself,	1
from	1
her	1
regrets,	1
desires,	1
remorse,	1
hopes,	1
and	1
sins.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
looked	1
round	1
several	1
times	1
at	1
her	1
daughter's	1
softened	1
face	1
and	1
shining	1
eyes	1
and	1
prayed	1
God	1
to	1
help	1
her.	1
	1
Unexpectedly,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
service,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
order	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
so	1
well,	1
the	1
deacon	1
brought	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
stool,	1
the	1
one	1
he	1
knelt	1
on	1
when	1
praying	1
on	1
Trinity	1
Sunday,	1
and	1
placed	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
screen.	1
The	1
priest	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
purple	1
velvet	1
biretta	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
adjusted	1
his	1
hair,	1
and	1
knelt	1
down	1
with	1
an	1
effort.	1
Everybody	1
followed	1
his	1
example	1
and	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
surprise.	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
prayer	1
just	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
Synod--a	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
deliverance	1
of	1
Russia	1
from	1
hostile	1
invasion.	1
	1
"Lord	1
God	1
of	1
might,	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
salvation!"	1
began	1
the	1
priest	1
in	1
that	1
voice,	1
clear,	1
not	1
grandiloquent	1
but	1
mild,	1
in	1
which	1
only	1
the	1
Slav	1
clergy	1
read	1
and	1
which	1
acts	1
so	1
irresistibly	1
on	1
a	1
Russian	1
heart.	1
	1
"Lord	1
God	1
of	1
might,	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
salvation!	1
Look	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
mercy	1
and	1
blessing	1
on	1
Thy	1
humble	1
people,	1
and	1
graciously	1
hear	1
us,	1
spare	1
us,	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
us!	1
This	1
foe	1
confounding	1
Thy	1
land,	1
desiring	1
to	1
lay	1
waste	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
rises	1
against	1
us;	1
these	1
lawless	1
men	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
overthrow	1
Thy	1
kingdom,	1
to	1
destroy	1
Thy	1
dear	1
Jerusalem,	1
Thy	1
beloved	1
Russia;	1
to	1
defile	1
Thy	1
temples,	1
to	1
overthrow	1
Thine	1
altars,	1
and	1
to	1
desecrate	1
our	1
holy	1
shrines.	1
How	1
long,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
the	1
wicked	1
triumph?	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
they	1
wield	1
unlawful	1
power?	1
	1
"Lord	1
God!	1
Hear	1
us	1
when	1
we	1
pray	1
to	1
Thee;	1
strengthen	1
with	1
Thy	1
might	1
our	1
most	1
gracious	1
sovereign	1
lord,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
Pavlovich;	1
be	1
mindful	1
of	1
his	1
uprightness	1
and	1
meekness,	1

him	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
righteousness,	1

over	1

the	1
hands	1

those	1

themselves	1
in	1
Thy	1
Name,	1
and	1
gird	1
their	1
loins	1
with	1
strength	1
for	1
the	1
fight.	1
Take	1
up	1
the	1
spear	1
and	1

arise	1

us;	1
confound	1

evil	1
against	1
us,	1
may	1
they	1

before	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
Thy	1
faithful	1

as	1

wind,	1
and	1
may	1
Thy	1
mighty	1
Angel	1

them	1

put	1
them	1
to	1
flight;	1
may	1
they	1
be	1

it	1
not,	1
and	1
may	1
the	1

laid	1
low	1
by	1
our	1

Lord,	1
Thou	1

able	1
to	1
save	1
both	1
great	1

Thou	1

	1
"God	1

Remember	1
Thy	1
bounteous	1

which	1
are	1
from	1
of	1

Thy	1

with	1
true	1

one	1
for	1

arm	1
us	1
with	1
unity	1
of	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
righteous	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
heritage	1
Thou	1
gavest	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
scepter	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
be	1
exalted	1
against	1
the	1
destiny	1
of	1
those	1
Thou	1
hast	1
sanctified.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord	1
our	1
God,	1
in	1
whom	1
we	1

and	1
in	1
whom	1
we	1

that	1

Show	1
Thy	1

upon	1

O	1

Thy	1

For	1
Thou	1

Father,	1
Son,	1
and	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
now	1
and	1
forever,	1
world	1
without	1
end.	1
Amen."	1
	1
In	1
Natasha's	1
receptive	1
condition	1
of	1
soul	1
this	1
prayer	1
affected	1
her	1
strongly.	1
She	1
listened	1
to	1
every	1
word	1
about	1
the	1
victory	1
of	1
Moses	1
over	1
Amalek,	1
of	1
Gideon	1
over	1
Midian,	1
and	1
of	1
David	1
over	1
Goliath,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
"Thy	1
Jerusalem,"	1
and	1
she	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
with	1
the	1
tenderness	1
and	1
emotion	1
with	1
which	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
overflowing,	1
but	1
without	1
fully	1
understanding	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
asking	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
that	1
prayer.	1
She	1
shared	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
for	1
the	1
strengthening	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
by	1
faith	1
and	1
hope,	1
and	1
its	1
animation	1
by	1
love.	1
But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
pray	1
that	1
her	1
enemies	1
might	1
be	1
trampled	1
under	1
foot	1
when	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
wishing	1
she	1
had	1
more	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
pray	1
for	1
them.	1
But	1
neither	1
could	1
she	1
doubt	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
prayer	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
read	1
on	1
bended	1
knees.	1
She	1
felt	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
a	1
devout	1
and	1
tremulous	1
awe	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
punishment	1
that	1
overtakes	1
men	1
for	1
their	1
sins,	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
sins,	1
and	1
she	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
forgive	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
her	1
too,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
her	1
too,	1
peace	1
and	1
happiness.	1
And	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
God	1
heard	1
her	1
prayer.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
From	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
Pierre,	1
after	1
leaving	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
with	1
Natasha's	1
grateful	1
look	1
fresh	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
had	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
comet	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
new	1
was	1
appearing	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
horizon--from	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
vanity	1
and	1
uselessness	1
of	1
all	1
earthly	1
things,	1
that	1
had	1
incessantly	1
tormented	1
him,	1
no	1
longer	1
presented	1
itself.	1
That	1
terrible	1
question	1
"Why?"	1
"Wherefore?"	1
which	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
amid	1
every	1
occupation,	1
was	1
now	1
replaced,	1
not	1
by	1
another	1
question	1
or	1
by	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
question,	1
but	1
by	1
her	1
image.	1
When	1
he	1
listened	1
to,	1
or	1
himself	1
took	1
part	1
in,	1
trivial	1
conversations,	1
when	1
he	1
read	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
human	1
baseness	1
or	1
folly,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
horrified	1
as	1
formerly,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
himself	1
why	1
men	1
struggled	1
so	1
about	1
these	1
things	1
when	1
all	1
is	1
so	1
transient	1
and	1
incomprehensible--but	1
he	1
remembered	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
last	1
seen	1
her,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
doubts	1
vanished--not	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
answered	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
had	1
haunted	1
him,	1
but	1
because	1
his	1
conception	1
of	1
her	1
transferred	1
him	1
instantly	1
to	1
another,	1
a	1
brighter,	1
realm	1
of	1
spiritual	1
activity	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
be	1
justified	1
or	1
guilty--a	1
realm	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
love	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
worth	1
living	1
for.	1
Whatever	1
worldly	1
baseness	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself:	1
	1
"Well,	1
supposing	1
N.	1
N.	1
swindled	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
the	1
Tsar,	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
the	1
Tsar	1
confer	1
honors	1
upon	1
him,	1
what	1
does	1
that	1
matter?	1
She	1
smiled	1
at	1
me	1
yesterday	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
again,	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
her,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
ever	1
know	1
it."	1
And	1
his	1
soul	1
felt	1
calm	1
and	1
peaceful.	1
	1
Pierre	1
still	1
went	1
into	1
society,	1
drank	1
as	1
much	1
and	1
led	1
the	1
same	1
idle	1
and	1
dissipated	1
life,	1
because	1
besides	1
the	1
hours	1
he	1
spent	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
hours	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
spend	1
somehow,	1
and	1
the	1
habits	1
and	1
acquaintances	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
Moscow	1
formed	1
a	1
current	1
that	1
bore	1
him	1
along	1
irresistibly.	1
But	1
latterly,	1
when	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
disquieting	1
reports	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
Natasha's	1
health	1
began	1
to	1
improve	1
and	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
former	1
feeling	1
of	1
careful	1
pity,	1
an	1
ever-	1
increasing	1
restlessness,	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
explain,	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
condition	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
could	1
not	1
continue	1
long,	1
that	1
a	1
catastrophe	1
was	1
coming	1
which	1
would	1
change	1
his	1
whole	1
life,	1
and	1
he	1
impatiently	1
sought	1
everywhere	1
for	1
signs	1
of	1
that	1
approaching	1
catastrophe.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
Masons	1
had	1
revealed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
the	1
following	1
prophecy	1
concerning	1
Napoleon,	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
Revelation	1
of	1
St.	1
John.	1
	1
In	1
chapter	1
13,	1
verse	1
18,	1
of	1
the	1
Apocalypse,	1
it	1
is	1
said:	1
	1
Here	1
is	1
wisdom.	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding	1
count	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
beast:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
a	1
man;	1
and	1
his	1
number	1
is	1
Six	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
six.	1
	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
verse	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
chapter:	1
	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
mouth	1
speaking	1
great	1
things	1
and	1
blasphemies;	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
continue	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
months.	1

Writing	1
the	1
words	1
L'Empereur	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
numbers,	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
666,	1
and	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
therefore	1
the	1
beast	1
foretold	1
in	1
the	1
Apocalypse.	1
Moreover,	1
by	1
applying	1
the	1
same	1
system	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
quarante-deux,	1
*	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
term	1
allowed	1
to	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
"spoke	1
great	1
things	1
and	1
blasphemies,"	1
the	1
same	1
number	1
666	1
was	1
obtained;	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
followed	1
that	1
the	1
limit	1
fixed	1
for	1
Napoleon's	1
power	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1812	1
when	1
the	1
French	1
emperor	1
was	1
forty-two.	1
This	1
prophecy	1
pleased	1
Pierre	1
very	1
much	1
and	1
he	1
often	1
asked	1
himself	1
what	1
would	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
tried	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
system	1
of	1
using	1
letters	1
as	1
numbers	1
and	1
adding	1
them	1
up,	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
engrossed	1
him.	1
He	1
wrote	1
the	1
words	1
L'Empereur	1
Alexandre,	1
La	1
nation	1
russe	1
and	1
added	1
up	1
their	1
numbers,	1
but	1
the	1
sums	1
were	1
either	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
than	1
666.	1
Once	1
when	1
making	1
such	1
calculations	1
he	1
wrote	1
down	1
his	1
own	1
name	1
in	1
French,	1
Comte	1
Pierre	1
Besouhoff,	1
but	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
numbers	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
right.	1
Then	1
he	1
changed	1
the	1
spelling,	1
substituting	1
a	1
z	1
for	1
the	1
s	1
and	1
adding	1
de	1
and	1
the	1
article	1
le,	1
still	1
without	1
obtaining	1
the	1
desired	1
result.	1
Then	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him:	1
if	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
were	1
contained	1
in	1
his	1
name,	1
his	1
nationality	1
would	1
also	1
be	1
given	1
in	1
the	1
answer.	1
So	1
he	1
wrote	1
Le	1
russe	1
Besuhof	1
and	1
adding	1
up	1
the	1
numbers	1
got	1
671.	1
This	1
was	1
only	1
five	1
too	1
much,	1
and	1
five	1
was	1
represented	1
by	1
e,	1
the	1
very	1
letter	1
elided	1
from	1
the	1
article	1
le	1
before	1
the	1
word	1
Empereur.	1
By	1
omitting	1
the	1
e,	1
though	1
incorrectly,	1
Pierre	1
got	1
the	1
answer	1
he	1
sought.	1
L'russe	1
Besuhof	1
made	1
666.	1
This	1
discovery	1
excited	1
him.	1
How,	1
or	1
by	1
what	1
means,	1
he	1
was	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
event	1
foretold	1
in	1
the	1
Apocalypse	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
connection	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
His	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha,	1
Antichrist,	1
Napoleon,	1
the	1
invasion,	1
the	1
comet,	1
666,	1
L'Empereur	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
L'russe	1
Besuhof--all	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
mature	1
and	1
culminate,	1
to	1
lift	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
spellbound,	1
petty	1
sphere	1
of	1
Moscow	1
habits	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
held	1
captive	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
achievement	1
and	1
great	1
happiness.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Forty-two.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
the	1
Sunday	1
when	1
the	1
special	1
prayer	1
was	1
read,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
promised	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
to	1
bring	1
them,	1
from	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
well,	1
both	1
the	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
news	1
from	1
the	1
army.	1
In	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
call	1
at	1
Rostopchin's	1
he	1
met	1
there	1
a	1
courier	1
fresh	1
from	1
the	1
army,	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
who	1
often	1
danced	1
at	1
Moscow	1
balls.	1
	1
"Do,	1
please,	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake,	1
relieve	1
me	1
of	1
something!"	1
said	1
the	1
courier.	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
sackful	1
of	1
letters	1
to	1
parents."	1
	1
Among	1
these	1
letters	1
was	1
one	1
from	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
that	1
letter,	1
and	1
Rostopchin	1
also	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
appeal	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
printed,	1
the	1
last	1
army	1
orders,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
most	1
recent	1
bulletin.	1
Glancing	1
through	1
the	1
army	1
orders,	1
Pierre	1
found	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
in	1
the	1
lists	1
of	1
killed,	1
wounded,	1
and	1
rewarded,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov,	1
awarded	1
a	1
St.	1
George's	1
Cross	1
of	1
the	1
Fourth	1
Class	1
for	1
courage	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
Ostrovna	1
affair,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
order	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski,	1
appointed	1
to	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
regiment	1
of	1
Chasseurs.	1
Though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
remind	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
of	1
Bolkonski,	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
making	1
them	1
happy	1
by	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
their	1
son's	1
having	1
received	1
a	1
decoration,	1
so	1
he	1
sent	1
that	1
printed	1
army	1
order	1
and	1
Nicholas'	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
keeping	1
the	1
appeal,	1
the	1
bulletin,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
orders	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
His	1
conversation	1
with	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
and	1
the	1
latter's	1
tone	1
of	1
anxious	1
hurry,	1
the	1
meeting	1
with	1
the	1
courier	1
who	1
talked	1
casually	1
of	1
how	1
badly	1
things	1
were	1
going	1
in	1
the	1
army,	1
the	1
rumors	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
spies	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
leaflet	1
in	1
circulation	1
stating	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
both	1
the	1
Russian	1
capitals	1
by	1
the	1
autumn,	1
and	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
being	1
expected	1
to	1
arrive	1
next	1
day--all	1
aroused	1
with	1
fresh	1
force	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
agitation	1
and	1
expectation	1
in	1
Pierre	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
conscious	1
of	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
comet,	1
and	1
especially	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
entering	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
hindered,	1
first,	1
by	1
his	1
membership	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Freemasons	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
by	1
oath	1
and	1
which	1
preached	1
perpetual	1
peace	1
and	1
the	1
abolition	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
secondly,	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
great	1
mass	1
of	1
Muscovites	1
who	1
had	1
donned	1
uniform	1
and	1
were	1
talking	1
patriotism,	1
he	1
somehow	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
step.	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
reason	1
for	1
not	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
army	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
vague	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
L'russe	1
Besuhof	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
666;	1
that	1
his	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
affair	1
of	1
setting	1
a	1
limit	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
spoke	1
great	1
and	1
blasphemous	1
things	1
had	1
been	1
predestined	1
from	1
eternity,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
undertake	1
anything,	1
but	1
wait	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
A	1
few	1
intimate	1
friends	1
were	1
dining	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
that	1
day,	1
as	1
usual	1
on	1
Sundays.	1
	1
Pierre	1
came	1
early	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
find	1
them	1
alone.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
stout	1
this	1
year	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
abnormal	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
tall,	1
so	1
broad	1
of	1
limb,	1
and	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
he	1
carried	1
his	1
bulk	1
with	1
evident	1
ease.	1
	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
stairs,	1
puffing	1
and	1
muttering	1
something.	1
His	1
coachman	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
ask	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
wait.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
he	1
stayed	1
till	1
midnight.	1
The	1
Rostovs'	1
footman	1
rushed	1
eagerly	1
forward	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
take	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
stick.	1
Pierre,	1
from	1
club	1
habit,	1
always	1
left	1
both	1
hat	1
and	1
stick	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
Natasha.	1
Even	1
before	1
he	1
saw	1
her,	1
while	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cloak,	1
he	1
heard	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
practicing	1
solfa	1
exercises	1
in	1
the	1
music	1
room.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
sung	1
since	1
her	1
illness,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
surprised	1
and	1
delighted	1
him.	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
softly	1
and	1
saw	1
her,	1
in	1
the	1
lilac	1
dress	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
at	1
church,	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
singing.	1
She	1
had	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
when,	1
turning	1
quickly,	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
broad,	1
surprised	1
face,	1
she	1
blushed	1
and	1
came	1
rapidly	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
sing	1
again,"	1
she	1
said,	1
adding	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
excuse,	1
"it	1
is,	1
at	1
least,	1
something	1
to	1
do."	1
	1
"That's	1
capital!"	1
	1
"How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
you've	1
come!	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
happy	1
today,"	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
animation	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
"You	1
know	1
Nicholas	1
has	1
received	1
a	1
St.	1
George's	1
Cross?	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
proud	1
of	1
him."	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
I	1
sent	1
that	1
announcement.	1
But	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
interrupt	1
you,"	1
he	1
added,	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
Natasha	1
stopped	1
him.	1
	1
"Count,	1
is	1
it	1
wrong	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
sing?"	1
she	1
said	1
blushing,	1
and	1
fixing	1
her	1
eyes	1
inquiringly	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
"No...	1
Why	1
should	1
it	1
be?	1
On	1
the	1
contrary...	1
But	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
ask	1
me?"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
myself,"	1
Natasha	1
answered	1
quickly,	1
"but	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
you	1
disapproved	1
of.	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
you	1
completely.	1
You	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
important	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
me,	1
how	1
much	1
you've	1
done	1
for	1
me...."	1
She	1
spoke	1
rapidly	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
how	1
Pierre	1
flushed	1
at	1
her	1
words.	1
"I	1
saw	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
army	1
order	1
that	1
he,	1
Bolkonski"	1
(she	1
whispered	1
the	1
name	1
hastily),	1
"is	1
in	1
Russia,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
again.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?"--she	1
was	1
speaking	1
hurriedly,	1
evidently	1
afraid	1
her	1
strength	1
might	1
fail	1
her--	1
"Will	1
he	1
ever	1
forgive	1
me?	1
Will	1
he	1
not	1
always	1
have	1
a	1
bitter	1
feeling	1
toward	1
me?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
	1
"I	1
think..."	1
Pierre	1
replied,	1
"that	1
he	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
forgive....	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
place..."	1
	1
By	1
association	1
of	1
ideas,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
carried	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
when,	1
trying	1
to	1
comfort	1
her,	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
himself	1
but	1
the	1
best	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
free,	1
he	1
would	1
ask	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
for	1
her	1
hand;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
pity,	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
love	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
lips.	1
But	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
them.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you...	1
you..."	1
she	1
said,	1
uttering	1
the	1
word	1
you	1
rapturously--	1
"that's	1
a	1
different	1
thing.	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
one	1
kinder,	1
more	1
generous,	1
or	1
better	1
than	1
you;	1
nobody	1
could	1
be!	1
Had	1
you	1
not	1
been	1
there	1
then,	1
and	1
now	1
too,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
become	1
of	1
me,	1
because..."	1
	1
Tears	1
suddenly	1
rose	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
she	1
turned	1
away,	1
lifted	1
her	1
music	1
before	1
her	1
eyes,	1
began	1
singing	1
again,	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
Petya	1
came	1
running	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
Petya	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
handsome	1
rosy	1
lad	1
of	1
fifteen	1
with	1
full	1
red	1
lips	1
and	1
resembled	1
Natasha.	1
He	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
university,	1
but	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
Obolenski	1
had	1
lately,	1
in	1
secret,	1
agreed	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
hussars.	1
	1
Petya	1
had	1
come	1
rushing	1
out	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
his	1
namesake	1
about	1
this	1
affair.	1
He	1
had	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
accepted	1
in	1
the	1
hussars.	1
	1
Pierre	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
Petya	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
Petya	1
pulled	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
to	1
attract	1
his	1
attention.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
about	1
my	1
plan?	1
Peter	1
Kirilych,	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake!	1
You	1
are	1
my	1
only	1
hope,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
your	1
plan.	1
To	1
join	1
the	1
hussars?	1
I'll	1
mention	1
it,	1
I'll	1
bring	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
today."	1
	1
"Well,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
the	1
manifesto?"	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
count.	1
"The	1
countess	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
Mass	1
at	1
the	1
Razumovskis'	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
new	1
prayer.	1
She	1
says	1
it's	1
very	1
fine."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I've	1
got	1
it,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
here	1
tomorrow...	1
there's	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
Extraordinary	1
Meeting	1
of	1
the	1
nobility,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
of	1
a	1
levy	1
of	1
ten	1
men	1
per	1
thousand.	1
Oh	1
yes,	1
let	1
me	1
congratulate	1
you!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
thank	1
God!	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
news	1
from	1
the	1
army?"	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
again	1
retreating.	1
They	1
say	1
we're	1
already	1
near	1
Smolensk,"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord,	1
O	1
Lord!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
count.	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
manifesto?"	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor's	1
appeal?	1
Oh	1
yes!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
began	1
feeling	1
in	1
his	1
pockets	1
for	1
the	1
papers,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
them.	1
Still	1
slapping	1
his	1
pockets,	1
he	1
kissed	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
who	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
glanced	1
uneasily	1
around,	1
evidently	1
expecting	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
off	1
singing	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"On	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
I've	1
done	1
with	1
it,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"There	1
he	1
is,	1
always	1
losing	1
everything!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
Natasha	1
entered	1
with	1
a	1
softened	1
and	1
agitated	1
expression	1
of	1
face	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
looking	1
silently	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
entered,	1
Pierre's	1
features,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
gloomy,	1
suddenly	1
lighted	1
up,	1
and	1
while	1
still	1
searching	1
for	1
the	1
papers	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
several	1
times.	1
	1
"No,	1
really!	1
I'll	1
drive	1
home,	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
left	1
them	1
there.	1
I'll	1
certainly..."	1
	1
"But	1
you'll	1
be	1
late	1
for	1
dinner."	1
	1
"Oh!	1
And	1
my	1
coachman	1
has	1
gone."	1
	1
But	1
Sonya,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
papers	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
had	1
found	1
them	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
hat,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
carefully	1
tucked	1
them	1
under	1
the	1
lining.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
begin	1
reading.	1
	1
"No,	1
after	1
dinner,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
evidently	1
expecting	1
much	1
enjoyment	1
from	1
that	1
reading.	1
	1
At	1
dinner,	1
at	1
which	1
champagne	1
was	1
drunk	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
chevalier	1
of	1
St.	1
George,	1
Shinshin	1
told	1
them	1
the	1
town	1
news,	1
of	1
the	1
illness	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Georgian	1
princess,	1
of	1
Metivier's	1
disappearance	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
some	1
German	1
fellow	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
to	1
Rostopchin	1
and	1
accused	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
French	1
"spyer"	1
(so	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
story),	1
and	1
how	1
Rostopchin	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
and	1
assured	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
"not	1
a	1
spire	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
only	1
an	1
old	1
German	1
ruin."	1
	1
"People	1
are	1
being	1
arrested..."	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"I've	1
told	1
the	1
countess	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
speak	1
French	1
so	1
much.	1
It's	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
it	1
now."	1
	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
heard?"	1
Shinshin	1
asked.	1
"Prince	1
Golitsyn	1
has	1
engaged	1
a	1
master	1
to	1
teach	1
him	1
Russian.	1
It	1
is	1
becoming	1
dangerous	1
to	1
speak	1
French	1
in	1
the	1
streets."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
about	1
you,	1
Count	1
Peter	1
Kirilych?	1
If	1
they	1
call	1
up	1
the	1
militia,	1
you	1
too	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
mount	1
a	1
horse,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
addressing	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
silent	1
and	1
preoccupied	1
all	1
through	1
dinner,	1
seeming	1
not	1
to	1
grasp	1
what	1
was	1
said.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
the	1
war,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"No!	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
warrior	1
should	1
I	1
make?	1
And	1
yet	1
everything	1
is	1
so	1
strange,	1
so	1
strange!	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
it	1
out.	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
military	1
tastes,	1
but	1
in	1
these	1
times	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
answer	1
for	1
himself."	1
	1
After	1
dinner	1
the	1
count	1
settled	1
himself	1
comfortably	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
serious	1
face	1
asked	1
Sonya,	1
who	1
was	1
considered	1
an	1
excellent	1
reader,	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
appeal.	1
	1
"To	1
Moscow,	1
our	1
ancient	1
Capital!	1
	1
"The	1
enemy	1
has	1
entered	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Russia	1
with	1
immense	1
forces.	1
He	1
comes	1
to	1
despoil	1
our	1
beloved	1
country."	1
	1
Sonya	1
read	1
painstakingly	1
in	1
her	1
high-pitched	1
voice.	1
The	1
count	1
listened	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes,	1
heaving	1
abrupt	1
sighs	1
at	1
certain	1
passages.	1
	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
erect,	1
gazing	1
with	1
a	1
searching	1
look	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
round.	1
The	1
countess	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
disapprovingly	1
and	1
angrily	1
at	1
every	1
solemn	1
expression	1
in	1
the	1
manifesto.	1
In	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
saw	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
danger	1
threatening	1
her	1
son	1
would	1
not	1
soon	1
be	1
over.	1
Shinshin,	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips,	1
was	1
evidently	1
preparing	1
to	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
opportunity:	1
Sonya's	1
reading,	1
any	1
remark	1
of	1
the	1
count's,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
manifesto	1
itself	1
should	1
no	1
better	1
pretext	1
present	1
itself.	1
	1
After	1
reading	1
about	1
the	1
dangers	1
that	1
threatened	1
Russia,	1
the	1
hopes	1
the	1
Emperor	1
placed	1
on	1
Moscow	1
and	1
especially	1
on	1
its	1
illustrious	1
nobility,	1
Sonya,	1
with	1
a	1
quiver	1
in	1
her	1
voice	1
due	1
chiefly	1
to	1
the	1
attention	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
paid	1
to	1
her,	1
read	1
the	1
last	1
words:	1
	1
"We	1
ourselves	1
will	1
not	1
delay	1
to	1
appear	1
among	1
our	1
people	1
in	1
that	1
Capital	1
and	1
in	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
our	1
realm	1
for	1
consultation,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
levies,	1
both	1
those	1
now	1
barring	1
the	1
enemy's	1
path	1
and	1
those	1
freshly	1
formed	1
to	1
defeat	1
him	1
wherever	1
he	1
may	1
appear.	1
May	1
the	1
ruin	1
he	1
hopes	1
to	1
bring	1
upon	1
us	1
recoil	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
head,	1
and	1
may	1
Europe	1
delivered	1
from	1
bondage	1
glorify	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Russia!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
it!"	1
cried	1
the	1
count,	1
opening	1
his	1
moist	1
eyes	1
and	1
sniffing	1
repeatedly,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
strong	1
vinaigrette	1
had	1
been	1
held	1
to	1
his	1
nose;	1
and	1
he	1
added,	1
"Let	1
the	1
Emperor	1
but	1
say	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
we'll	1
sacrifice	1
everything	1
and	1
begrudge	1
nothing."	1
	1
Before	1
Shinshin	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
joke	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
make	1
on	1
the	1
count's	1
patriotism,	1
Natasha	1
jumped	1
up	1
from	1
her	1
place	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
father.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
darling	1
our	1
Papa	1
is!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
kissing	1
him,	1
and	1
she	1
again	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
the	1
unconscious	1
coquetry	1
that	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
better	1
spirits.	1
	1
"There!	1
Here's	1
a	1
patriot	1
for	1
you!"	1
said	1
Shinshin.	1
	1
"Not	1
a	1
patriot	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
simply..."	1
Natasha	1
replied	1
in	1
an	1
injured	1
tone.	1
"Everything	1
seems	1
funny	1
to	1
you,	1
but	1
this	1
isn't	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
joke...."	1
	1
"A	1
joke	1
indeed!"	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
count.	1
"Let	1
him	1
but	1
say	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
we'll	1
all	1
go....	1
We're	1
not	1
Germans!"	1
	1
"But	1
did	1
you	1
notice,	1
it	1
says,	1
'for	1
consultation'?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Never	1
mind	1
what	1
it's	1
for...."	1
	1
At	1
this	1
moment,	1
Petya,	1
to	1
whom	1
nobody	1
was	1
paying	1
any	1
attention,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
flushed	1
face	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
breaking	1
voice	1
that	1
was	1
now	1
deep	1
and	1
now	1
shrill:	1
	1
"Well,	1
Papa,	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
definitely,	1
and	1
Mamma	1
too,	1
it's	1
as	1
you	1
please,	1
but	1
I	1
say	1
definitely	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
let	1
me	1
enter	1
the	1
army,	1
because	1
I	1
can't...	1
that's	1
all...."	1
	1
The	1
countess,	1
in	1
dismay,	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
turned	1
angrily	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"That	1
comes	1
of	1
your	1
talking!"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
already	1
recovered	1
from	1
his	1
excitement.	1
	1
"Come,	1
come!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Here's	1
a	1
fine	1
warrior!	1
No!	1
Nonsense!	1
You	1
must	1
study."	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
nonsense,	1
Papa.	1
Fedya	1
Obolenski	1
is	1
younger	1
than	1
I,	1
and	1
he's	1
going	1
too.	1
Besides,	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
I	1
can't	1
study	1
now	1
when..."	1
Petya	1
stopped	1
short,	1
flushed	1
till	1
he	1
perspired,	1
but	1
still	1
got	1
out	1
the	1
words,	1
"when	1
our	1
Fatherland	1
is	1
in	1
danger."	1
	1
"That'll	1
do,	1
that'll	1
do--nonsense...."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
said	1
yourself	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
sacrifice	1
everything."	1
	1
"Petya!	1
Be	1
quiet,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!"	1
cried	1
the	1
count,	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
his	1
wife,	1
who	1
had	1
turned	1
pale	1
and	1
was	1
staring	1
fixedly	1
at	1
her	1
son.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
tell	1
you--Peter	1
Kirilych	1
here	1
will	1
also	1
tell	1
you..."	1
	1
"Nonsense,	1
I	1
tell	1
you.	1
Your	1
mother's	1
milk	1
has	1
hardly	1
dried	1
on	1
your	1
lips	1
and	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
army!	1
There,	1
there,	1
I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
moved	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
taking	1
the	1
papers,	1
probably	1
to	1
reread	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
before	1
having	1
a	1
nap.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Peter	1
Kirilych,	1
let's	1
go	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
smoke,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
agitated	1
and	1
undecided.	1
Natasha's	1
unwontedly	1
brilliant	1
eyes,	1
continually	1
glancing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
cordial	1
look,	1
had	1
reduced	1
him	1
to	1
this	1
condition.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
think	1
I'll	1
go	1
home."	1
	1
"Home?	1
Why,	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
us....	1
You	1
don't	1
often	1
come	1
nowadays	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
this	1
girl	1
of	1
mine,"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
good-	1
naturedly,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
"only	1
brightens	1
up	1
when	1
you're	1
here."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
had	1
forgotten...	1
I	1
really	1
must	1
go	1
home...	1
business..."	1
said	1
Pierre	1
hurriedly.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
au	1
revoir!"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
going?	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
upset?"	1
asked	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
challengingly	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Because	1
I	1
love	1
you!"	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
it,	1
and	1
only	1
blushed	1
till	1
the	1
tears	1
came,	1
and	1
lowered	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Because	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
less	1
often...	1
because...	1
No,	1
simply	1
I	1
have	1
business...."	1
	1
"Why?	1
No,	1
tell	1
me!"	1
Natasha	1
began	1
resolutely	1
and	1
suddenly	1
stopped.	1
	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
dismayed	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
faces.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
smile	1
but	1
could	1
not:	1
his	1
smile	1
expressed	1
suffering,	1
and	1
he	1
silently	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
Pierre	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
After	1
the	1
definite	1
refusal	1
he	1
had	1
received,	1
Petya	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
there	1
locked	1
himself	1
in	1
and	1
wept	1
bitterly.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
tea,	1
silent,	1
morose,	1
and	1
with	1
tear-stained	1
face,	1
everybody	1
pretended	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
anything.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
Emperor	1
arrived	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
domestic	1
serfs	1
begged	1
permission	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
him.	1
That	1
morning	1
Petya	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
dressing	1
and	1
arranging	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
collar	1
to	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
grown-up	1
man.	1
He	1
frowned	1
before	1
his	1
looking	1
glass,	1
gesticulated,	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
finally,	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
anyone,	1
took	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
door,	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
notice.	1
Petya	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
and	1
to	1
explain	1
frankly	1
to	1
some	1
gentleman-in-waiting	1
(he	1
imagined	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
surrounded	1
by	1
gentlemen-in-waiting)	1
that	1
he,	1
Count	1
Rostov,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
youth	1
wished	1
to	1
serve	1
his	1
country;	1
that	1
youth	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
hindrance	1
to	1
loyalty,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to...	1
While	1
dressing,	1
Petya	1
had	1
prepared	1
many	1
fine	1
things	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman-in-	1
waiting.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
fact	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
young	1
that	1
Petya	1
counted	1
for	1
success	1
in	1
reaching	1
the	1
Emperor--he	1
even	1
thought	1
how	1
surprised	1
everyone	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
his	1
youthfulness--and	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
his	1
collar	1
and	1
hair	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
sedate	1
deliberate	1
walk	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
appear	1
a	1
grown-up	1
man.	1
But	1
the	1
farther	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
diverted	1
by	1
the	1
ever-increasing	1
crowds	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
the	1
less	1
he	1
remembered	1
to	1
walk	1
with	1
the	1
sedateness	1
and	1
deliberation	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
As	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
he	1
even	1
began	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
crushed	1
and	1
resolutely	1
stuck	1
out	1
his	1
elbows	1
in	1
a	1
menacing	1
way.	1
But	1
within	1
the	1
Trinity	1
Gateway	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
pressed	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
by	1
people	1
who	1
probably	1
were	1
unaware	1
of	1
the	1
patriotic	1
intentions	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
determination	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
in,	1
and	1
stop	1
while	1
carriages	1
passed	1
in,	1
rumbling	1
beneath	1
the	1
archway.	1
Beside	1
Petya	1
stood	1
a	1
peasant	1
woman,	1
a	1
footman,	1
two	1
tradesmen,	1
and	1
a	1
discharged	1
soldier.	1
After	1
standing	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
gateway,	1
Petya	1
tried	1
to	1
move	1
forward	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
carriages	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
resolutely	1
working	1
his	1
way	1
with	1
his	1
elbows,	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
against	1
whom	1
he	1
directed	1
his	1
efforts,	1
angrily	1
shouted	1
at	1
him:	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
shoving	1
for,	1
young	1
lordling?	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
we're	1
all	1
standing	1
still?	1
Then	1
why	1
push?"	1
	1
"Anybody	1
can	1
shove,"	1
said	1
the	1
footman,	1
and	1
also	1
began	1
working	1
his	1
elbows	1
to	1
such	1
effect	1
that	1
he	1
pushed	1
Petya	1
into	1
a	1
very	1
filthy	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
gateway.	1
	1
Petya	1
wiped	1
his	1
perspiring	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
pulled	1
up	1
the	1
damp	1
collar	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
arranged	1
so	1
well	1
at	1
home	1
to	1
seem	1
like	1
a	1
man's.	1
	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
looked	1
presentable,	1
and	1
feared	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
now	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
gentlemen-in-waiting	1
in	1
that	1
plight	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
smarten	1
oneself	1
up	1
or	1
move	1
to	1
another	1
place,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
who	1
drove	1
past	1
was	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs',	1
and	1
Petya	1
thought	1
of	1
asking	1
his	1
help,	1
but	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
manly	1
thing	1
to	1
do.	1
When	1
the	1
carriages	1
had	1
all	1
passed	1
in,	1
the	1
crowd,	1
carrying	1
Petya	1
with	1
it,	1
streamed	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
Square	1
which	1
was	1
already	1
full	1
of	1
people.	1
There	1
were	1
people	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
square,	1
but	1
everywhere--on	1
the	1
slopes	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
roofs.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Petya	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
square	1
he	1
clearly	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
bells	1
and	1
the	1
joyous	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
that	1
filled	1
the	1
whole	1
Kremlin.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
crowd	1
was	1
less	1
dense,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
all	1
heads	1
were	1
bared,	1
and	1
everyone	1
rushed	1
forward	1
in	1
one	1
direction.	1
Petya	1
was	1
being	1
pressed	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
scarcely	1
breathe,	1
and	1
everybody	1
shouted,	1
"Hurrah!	1
hurrah!	1
hurrah!"	1
Petya	1
stood	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
pushed	1
and	1
pinched,	1
but	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
except	1
the	1
people	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
faces	1
bore	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
excitement	1
and	1
enthusiasm.	1
A	1
tradesman's	1
wife	1
standing	1
beside	1
Petya	1
sobbed,	1
and	1
the	1
tears	1
ran	1
down	1
her	1
cheeks.	1
	1
"Father!	1
Angel!	1
Dear	1
one!"	1
she	1
kept	1
repeating,	1
wiping	1
away	1
her	1
tears	1
with	1
her	1
fingers.	1
	1
"Hurrah!"	1
was	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
crowd	1
stood	1
still,	1
but	1
then	1
it	1
made	1
another	1
rush	1
forward.	1
	1
Quite	1
beside	1
himself,	1
Petya,	1
clinching	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
rolling	1
his	1
eyes	1
ferociously,	1
pushed	1
forward,	1
elbowing	1
his	1
way	1
and	1
shouting	1
"hurrah!"	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
prepared	1
that	1
instant	1
to	1
kill	1
himself	1
and	1
everyone	1
else,	1
but	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
him	1
other	1
people	1
with	1
similarly	1
ferocious	1
faces	1
pushed	1
forward	1
and	1
everybody	1
shouted	1
"hurrah!"	1
	1
"So	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
Emperor	1
is!"	1
thought	1
Petya.	1
"No,	1
I	1
can't	1
petition	1
him	1
myself--that	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
bold."	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
struggle	1
desperately	1
forward,	1
and	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
front	1
he	1
caught	1
glimpses	1
of	1
an	1
open	1
space	1
with	1
a	1
strip	1
of	1
red	1
cloth	1
spread	1
out	1
on	1
it;	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
crowd	1
swayed	1
back--the	1
police	1
in	1
front	1
were	1
pushing	1
back	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
pressed	1
too	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
procession:	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
passing	1
from	1
the	1
palace	1
to	1
the	1
Cathedral	1
of	1
the	1
Assumption--and	1
Petya	1
unexpectedly	1
received	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
ribs	1
and	1
was	1
squeezed	1
so	1
hard	1
that	1
suddenly	1
everything	1
grew	1
dim	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
lost	1
consciousness.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
clerical	1
appearance	1
with	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
gray	1
hair	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
shabby	1
blue	1
cassock--probably	1
a	1
church	1
clerk	1
and	1
chanter--was	1
holding	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
arm	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
while	1
warding	1
off	1
the	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
with	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"You've	1
crushed	1
the	1
young	1
gentleman!"	1
said	1
the	1
clerk.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
up	1
to?	1
Gently!...	1
They've	1
crushed	1
him,	1
crushed	1
him!"	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
entered	1
the	1
Cathedral	1
of	1
the	1
Assumption.	1
The	1
crowd	1
spread	1
out	1
again	1
more	1
evenly,	1
and	1
the	1
clerk	1
led	1
Petya--pale	1
and	1
breathless--to	1
the	1
Tsar-cannon.	1
Several	1
people	1
were	1
sorry	1
for	1
Petya,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
a	1
crowd	1
turned	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
pressed	1
round	1
him.	1
Those	1
who	1
stood	1
nearest	1
him	1
attended	1
to	1
him,	1
unbuttoned	1
his	1
coat,	1
seated	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
raised	1
platform	1
of	1
the	1
cannon,	1
and	1
reproached	1
those	1
others	1
(whoever	1
they	1
might	1
be)	1
who	1
had	1
crushed	1
him.	1
	1
"One	1
might	1
easily	1
get	1
killed	1
that	1
way!	1
What	1
do	1
they	1
mean	1
by	1
it?	1
Killing	1
people!	1
Poor	1
dear,	1
he's	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
a	1
sheet!"--various	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
saying.	1
	1
Petya	1
soon	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
the	1
color	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
face,	1
the	1
pain	1
had	1
passed,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
that	1
temporary	1
unpleasantness	1
he	1
had	1
obtained	1
a	1
place	1
by	1
the	1
cannon	1
from	1
where	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Emperor	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
returning	1
that	1
way.	1
Petya	1
no	1
longer	1
thought	1
of	1
presenting	1
his	1
petition.	1
If	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
see	1
the	1
Emperor	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
happy!	1
	1
While	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
proceeding	1
in	1
the	1
Cathedral	1
of	1
the	1
Assumption--it	1
was	1
a	1
combined	1
service	1
of	1
prayer	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
arrival	1
and	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
for	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
Turks--	1
the	1
crowd	1
outside	1
spread	1
out	1
and	1
hawkers	1
appeared,	1
selling	1
kvas,	1
gingerbread,	1
and	1
poppyseed	1
sweets	1
(of	1
which	1
Petya	1
was	1
particularly	1
fond),	1
and	1
ordinary	1
conversation	1
could	1
again	1
be	1
heard.	1
A	1
tradesman's	1
wife	1
was	1
showing	1
a	1
rent	1
in	1
her	1
shawl	1
and	1
telling	1
how	1
much	1
the	1
shawl	1
had	1
cost;	1
another	1
was	1
saying	1
that	1
all	1
silk	1
goods	1
had	1
now	1
got	1
dear.	1
The	1
clerk	1
who	1
had	1
rescued	1
Petya	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
functionary	1
about	1
the	1
priests	1
who	1
were	1
officiating	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
the	1
bishop.	1
The	1
clerk	1
several	1
times	1
used	1
the	1
word	1
"plenary"	1
(of	1
the	1
service),	1
a	1
word	1
Petya	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
Two	1
young	1
citizens	1
were	1
joking	1
with	1
some	1
serf	1
girls	1
who	1
were	1
cracking	1
nuts.	1
All	1
these	1
conversations,	1
especially	1
the	1
joking	1
with	1
the	1
girls,	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
particular	1
charm	1
for	1
Petya	1
at	1
his	1
age,	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him	1
now.	1
He	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
elevation--the	1
pedestal	1
of	1
the	1
cannon--still	1
agitated	1
as	1
before	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
him.	1
The	1
feeling	1
of	1
pain	1
and	1
fear	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
crushed,	1
together	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
rapture,	1
still	1
further	1
intensified	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
occasion.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
firing	1
of	1
cannon	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
embankment,	1
to	1
celebrate	1
the	1
signing	1
of	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
Turks,	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
rushed	1
impetuously	1
toward	1
the	1
embankment	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
firing.	1
Petya	1
too	1
would	1
have	1
run	1
there,	1
but	1
the	1
clerk	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
young	1
gentleman	1
under	1
his	1
protection	1
stopped	1
him.	1
The	1
firing	1
was	1
still	1
proceeding	1
when	1
officers,	1
generals,	1
and	1
gentlemen-in-waiting	1
came	1
running	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cathedral,	1
and	1
after	1
them	1
others	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
leisurely	1
manner:	1
caps	1
were	1
again	1
raised,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
cannon	1
ran	1
back	1
again.	1
At	1
last	1
four	1
men	1
in	1
uniforms	1
and	1
sashes	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
cathedral	1
doors.	1
"Hurrah!	1
hurrah!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
crowd	1
again.	1
	1
"Which	1
is	1
he?	1
Which?"	1
asked	1
Petya	1
in	1
a	1
tearful	1
voice,	1
of	1
those	1
around	1
him,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
answered	1
him,	1
everybody	1
was	1
too	1
excited;	1
and	1
Petya,	1
fixing	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
four	1
men,	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
clearly	1
see	1
for	1
the	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
eyes,	1
concentrated	1
all	1
his	1
enthusiasm	1
on	1
him--though	1
it	1
happened	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Emperor--frantically	1
shouted	1
"Hurrah!"	1
and	1
resolved	1
that	1
tomorrow,	1
come	1
what	1
might,	1
he	1
would	1
join	1
the	1
army.	1
	1
The	1
crowd	1
ran	1
after	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
followed	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
palace,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
disperse.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
late,	1
and	1
Petya	1
had	1
not	1
eaten	1
anything	1
and	1
was	1
drenched	1
with	1
perspiration,	1
yet	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
home	1
but	1
stood	1
with	1
that	1
diminishing,	1
but	1
still	1
considerable,	1
crowd	1
before	1
the	1
palace	1
while	1
the	1
Emperor	1
dined--looking	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
windows,	1
expecting	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what,	1
and	1
envying	1
alike	1
the	1
notables	1
he	1
saw	1
arriving	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
the	1
court	1
footmen	1
who	1
served	1
at	1
table,	1
glimpses	1
of	1
whom	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
the	1
windows.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
dining,	1
Valuev,	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
said:	1
	1
"The	1
people	1
are	1
still	1
hoping	1
to	1
see	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
again."	1
	1
The	1
dinner	1
was	1
nearly	1
over,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
munching	1
a	1
biscuit,	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
balcony.	1
The	1
people,	1
with	1
Petya	1
among	1
them,	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
balcony.	1
	1
"Angel!	1
Dear	1
one!	1
Hurrah!	1
Father!..."	1
cried	1
the	1
crowd,	1
and	1
Petya	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
weaker	1
mold,	1
Petya	1
among	1
them,	1
wept	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
A	1
largish	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
biscuit	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
holding	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
broke	1
off,	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
balcony	1
parapet,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
A	1
coachman	1
in	1
a	1
jerkin,	1
who	1
stood	1
nearest,	1
sprang	1
forward	1
and	1
snatched	1
it	1
up.	1
Several	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
coachman.	1
Seeing	1
this	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
a	1
plateful	1
of	1
biscuits	1
brought	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
throwing	1
them	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
balcony.	1
Petya's	1
eyes	1
grew	1
bloodshot,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
excited	1
by	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
crushed,	1
he	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
biscuits.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
why,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
biscuit	1
from	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
hand	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
give	1
way.	1
He	1
sprang	1
forward	1
and	1
upset	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
catching	1
at	1
a	1
biscuit;	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
herself	1
defeated	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
ground--she	1
grabbed	1
at	1
some	1
biscuits	1
but	1
her	1
hand	1
did	1
not	1
reach	1
them.	1
Petya	1
pushed	1
her	1
hand	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
knee,	1
seized	1
a	1
biscuit,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
fearing	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
late,	1
again	1
shouted	1
"Hurrah!"	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
already	1
hoarse.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
began	1
to	1
disperse.	1
	1
"There!	1
I	1
said	1
if	1
only	1
we	1
waited--and	1
so	1
it	1
was!"	1
was	1
being	1
joyfully	1
said	1
by	1
various	1
people.	1
	1
Happy	1
as	1
Petya	1
was,	1
he	1
felt	1
sad	1
at	1
having	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
knowing	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
was	1
over.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
straight	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
but	1
called	1
on	1
his	1
friend	1
Obolenski,	1
who	1
was	1
fifteen	1
and	1
was	1
also	1
entering	1
the	1
regiment.	1
On	1
returning	1
home	1
Petya	1
announced	1
resolutely	1
and	1
firmly	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
allowed	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
service	1
he	1
would	1
run	1
away.	1
And	1
next	1
day,	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov--though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
quite	1
yielded--went	1
to	1
inquire	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
arrange	1
for	1
Petya	1
to	1
serve	1
where	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
least	1
danger.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXII	1
	1
Two	1
days	1
later,	1
on	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
of	1
July,	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
carriages	1
were	1
standing	1
outside	1
the	1
Sloboda	1
Palace.	1
	1
The	1
great	1
halls	1
were	1
full.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
were	1
the	1
nobility	1
and	1
gentry	1
in	1
their	1
uniforms,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
bearded	1
merchants	1
in	1
full-skirted	1
coats	1
of	1
blue	1
cloth	1
and	1
wearing	1
medals.	1
In	1
the	1
noblemen's	1
hall	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
incessant	1
movement	1
and	1
buzz	1
of	1
voices.	1
The	1
chief	1
magnates	1
sat	1
on	1
high-	1
backed	1
chairs	1
at	1
a	1
large	1
table	1
under	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
gentry	1
were	1
strolling	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
All	1
these	1
nobles,	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
met	1
every	1
day	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
houses,	1
were	1
in	1
uniform--some	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
day,	1
others	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
Emperor	1
Paul,	1
others	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
uniforms	1
of	1
Alexander's	1
time	1
or	1
the	1
ordinary	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
nobility,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
characteristic	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
uniform	1
imparted	1
something	1
strange	1
and	1
fantastic	1
to	1
these	1
diverse	1
and	1
familiar	1
personalities,	1
both	1
old	1
and	1
young.	1
The	1
old	1
men,	1
dim-eyed,	1
toothless,	1
bald,	1
sallow,	1
and	1
bloated,	1
or	1
gaunt	1
and	1
wrinkled,	1
were	1
especially	1
striking.	1
For	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
they	1
sat	1
quietly	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
and	1
were	1
silent,	1
or,	1
if	1
they	1
walked	1
about	1
and	1
talked,	1
attached	1
themselves	1
to	1
someone	1
younger.	1
On	1
all	1
these	1
faces,	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
Petya	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
Square,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
striking	1
contradiction:	1
the	1
general	1
expectation	1
of	1
a	1
solemn	1
event,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
everyday	1
interests	1
in	1
a	1
boston	1
card	1
party,	1
Peter	1
the	1
cook,	1
Zinaida	1
Dmitrievna's	1
health,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
there	1
too,	1
buttoned	1
up	1
since	1
early	1
morning	1
in	1
a	1
nobleman's	1
uniform	1
that	1
had	1
become	1
too	1
tight	1
for	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
agitated;	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
gathering	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
nobles	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
merchant-	1
class--les	1
etats	1
generaux	1
(States-General)--evoked	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
ideas	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
laid	1
aside	1
but	1
which	1
were	1
deeply	1
graven	1
in	1
his	1
soul:	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
Contrat	1
Social	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution.	1
The	1
words	1
that	1
had	1
struck	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
appeal--that	1
the	1
sovereign	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
capital	1
for	1
consultation	1
with	1
his	1
people--strengthened	1
this	1
idea.	1
And	1
imagining	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
something	1
important	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
awaited	1
was	1
drawing	1
near,	1
he	1
strolled	1
about	1
watching	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
conversations,	1
but	1
nowhere	1
finding	1
any	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
ideas	1
that	1
occupied	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
manifesto	1
was	1
read,	1
evoking	1
enthusiasm,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
moved	1
about	1
discussing	1
it.	1
Besides	1
the	1
ordinary	1
topics	1
of	1
conversation,	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
questions	1
of	1
where	1
the	1
marshals	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
were	1
to	1
stand	1
when	1
the	1
Emperor	1
entered,	1
when	1
a	1
ball	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
honor,	1
whether	1
they	1
should	1
group	1
themselves	1
by	1
districts	1
or	1
by	1
whole	1
provinces...	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
touched	1
on,	1
or	1
what	1
the	1
nobility	1
had	1
been	1
convened	1
for,	1
the	1
talk	1
became	1
undecided	1
and	1
indefinite.	1
Then	1
all	1
preferred	1
listening	1
to	1
speaking.	1
	1
A	1
middle-aged	1
man,	1
handsome	1
and	1
virile,	1
in	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
a	1
retired	1
naval	1
officer,	1
was	1
speaking	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
rooms,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
crowd	1
was	1
pressing	1
round	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
circle	1
that	1
had	1
formed	1
round	1
the	1
speaker	1
and	1
listened.	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
in	1
a	1
military	1
uniform	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
time,	1
was	1
sauntering	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
among	1
the	1
crowd,	1
with	1
all	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
acquainted.	1
He	1
too	1
approached	1
that	1
group	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
a	1
kindly	1
smile	1
and	1
nods	1
of	1
approval,	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did,	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
speaker	1
was	1
saying.	1
The	1
retired	1
naval	1
man	1
was	1
speaking	1
very	1
boldly,	1
as	1
was	1
evident	1
from	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
listeners	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
some	1
people	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
as	1
the	1
meekest	1
and	1
quietest	1
of	1
men	1
walked	1
away	1
disapprovingly	1
or	1
expressed	1
disagreement	1
with	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
pushed	1
his	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
group,	1
listened,	1
and	1
convinced	1
himself	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
liberal,	1
but	1
of	1
views	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
naval	1
officer	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
particularly	1
sonorous,	1
musical,	1
and	1
aristocratic	1
baritone	1
voice,	1
pleasantly	1
swallowing	1
his	1
r's	1
and	1
generally	1
slurring	1
his	1
consonants:	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
calling	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
"Heah!	1
Bwing	1
me	1
my	1
pipe!"	1
It	1
was	1
indicative	1
of	1
dissipation	1
and	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
authority.	1
	1
"What	1
if	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
people	1
have	1
offahd	1
to	1
waise	1
militia	1
for	1
the	1
Empewah?	1
Ah	1
we	1
to	1
take	1
Smolensk	1
as	1
our	1
patte'n?	1
If	1
the	1
noble	1
awistocwacy	1
of	1
the	1
pwovince	1
of	1
Moscow	1
thinks	1
fit,	1
it	1
can	1
show	1
its	1
loyalty	1
to	1
our	1
sov'weign	1
the	1
Empewah	1
in	1
other	1
ways.	1
Have	1
we	1
fo'gotten	1
the	1
waising	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
in	1
the	1
yeah	1
'seven?	1
All	1
that	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
enwich	1
the	1
pwiests'	1
sons	1
and	1
thieves	1
and	1
wobbahs...."	1
	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
smiled	1
blandly	1
and	1
nodded	1
approval.	1
	1
"And	1
was	1
our	1
militia	1
of	1
any	1
use	1
to	1
the	1
Empia?	1
Not	1
at	1
all!	1
It	1
only	1
wuined	1
our	1

Bettah	1

The	1

will	1
go	1
and	1
bwing	1
in	1
more	1
wecwuits,	1
and	1
the	1
sov'weign"	1
(that	1
was	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor)	1
"need	1
only	1
say	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
we'll	1
all	1
die	1
fo'	1
him!"	1
added	1
the	1
orator	1
with	1
animation.	1
	1
Count	1
Rostov's	1
mouth	1
watered	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
nudged	1
Pierre,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
himself.	1
He	1
pushed	1
forward,	1
feeling	1
stirred,	1
but	1
not	1
yet	1
sure	1
what	1
stirred	1
him	1
or	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
senators,	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
a	1
tooth	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
with	1
a	1
shrewd	1
though	1
angry	1
expression,	1
standing	1
near	1
the	1
first	1
speaker,	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
Evidently	1
accustomed	1
to	1
managing	1
debates	1
and	1
to	1
maintaining	1
an	1
argument,	1
he	1
began	1
in	1
low	1
but	1
distinct	1
tones:	1
	1
"I	1
imagine,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he,	1
mumbling	1
with	1
his	1
toothless	1
mouth,	1
"that	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
summoned	1
here	1
not	1
to	1
discuss	1
whether	1
it's	1
best	1
for	1
the	1
empire	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment	1
to	1
adopt	1
conscription	1
or	1
to	1
call	1
out	1
the	1
militia.	1
We	1
have	1
been	1
summoned	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
appeal	1
with	1
which	1
our	1
sovereign	1
the	1
Emperor	1
has	1
honored	1
us.	1
But	1
to	1
judge	1
what	1
is	1
best--conscription	1
or	1
the	1
militia--we	1
can	1
leave	1
to	1
the	1
supreme	1
authority...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
saw	1
an	1
outlet	1
for	1
his	1
excitement.	1
He	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart	1
against	1
the	1
senator	1
who	1
was	1
introducing	1
this	1
set	1
and	1
narrow	1
attitude	1
into	1
the	1
deliberations	1
of	1
the	1
nobility.	1
Pierre	1
stepped	1
forward	1
and	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
He	1
himself	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say,	1
but	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
eagerly,	1
occasionally	1
lapsing	1
into	1
French	1
or	1
expressing	1
himself	1
in	1
bookish	1
Russian.	1
	1
"Excuse	1
me,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
he	1
began.	1
(He	1
was	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
senator,	1
but	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
to	1
address	1
him	1
formally.)	1
"Though	1
I	1
don't	1
agree	1
with	1
the	1
gentleman..."	1
(he	1
hesitated:	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
say,	1
"Mon	1
tres	1
honorable	1
preopinant"--"My	1
very	1
honorable	1
opponent")	1
"with	1
the	1
gentleman...	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
knowing,	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
nobility	1
have	1
been	1
summoned	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
sympathy	1
and	1
enthusiasm	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
means	1
by	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
assist	1
our	1
Fatherland!	1
I	1
imagine,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
warming	1
to	1
his	1
subject,	1
"that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
us	1
merely	1
owners	1
of	1
serfs	1
whom	1
we	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
devote	1
to	1
his	1
service,	1
and	1
chair	1
a	1
canon	1
*	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
ourselves--and	1
not	1
to	1
obtain	1
from	1
us	1
any	1
co-co-counsel."	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Food	1
for	1
cannon."	1
	1
Many	1
persons	1
withdrew	1
from	1
the	1
circle,	1
noticing	1
the	1
senator's	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
and	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
remarks.	1
Only	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
pleased	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
naval	1
officer,	1
the	1
senator,	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
with	1
whatever	1
speech	1
he	1
had	1
last	1
heard.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
before	1
discussing	1
these	1
questions,"	1
Pierre	1
continued,	1
"we	1
should	1
ask	1
the	1
Emperor--most	1
respectfully	1
ask	1
His	1
Majesty--to	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
our	1
troops	1
and	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
army	1
and	1
our	1
forces	1
now	1
are,	1
and	1
then..."	1
	1
But	1
scarcely	1
had	1
Pierre	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
attacked	1
from	1
three	1
sides.	1
The	1
most	1
vigorous	1
attack	1
came	1
from	1
an	1
old	1
acquaintance,	1
a	1
boston	1
player	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
well	1
disposed	1
toward	1
him,	1
Stepan	1
Stepanovich	1
Adraksin.	1
Adraksin	1
was	1
in	1
uniform,	1
and	1
whether	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
uniform	1
or	1
from	1
some	1
other	1
cause	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
before	1
him	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
man.	1
With	1
a	1
sudden	1
expression	1
of	1
malevolence	1
on	1
his	1
aged	1
face,	1
Adraksin	1
shouted	1
at	1
Pierre:	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
question	1
the	1
Emperor	1
about	1
that,	1
and	1
secondly,	1
if	1
the	1
Russian	1
nobility	1
had	1
that	1
right,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
such	1
a	1
question.	1
The	1
troops	1
are	1
moved	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
enemy's	1
movements	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
increases	1
and	1
decreases..."	1
	1
Another	1
voice,	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
nobleman	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
and	1
about	1
forty	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
had	1
formerly	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
gypsies'	1
and	1
knew	1
as	1
a	1
bad	1
cardplayer,	1
and	1
who,	1
also	1
transformed	1
by	1
his	1
uniform,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
interrupted	1
Adraksin.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
discussing,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"but	1
for	1
acting:	1
there	1
is	1
war	1
in	1
Russia!	1
The	1
enemy	1
is	1
advancing	1
to	1
destroy	1
Russia,	1
to	1
desecrate	1
the	1
tombs	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
our	1
wives	1
and	1
children."	1
The	1
nobleman	1
smote	1
his	1
breast.	1
"We	1
will	1
all	1
arise,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
will	1
go,	1
for	1
our	1
father	1
the	1
Tsar!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
rolling	1
his	1
bloodshot	1
eyes.	1
Several	1
approving	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
crowd.	1
"We	1
are	1
Russians	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
grudge	1
our	1
blood	1
in	1
defense	1
of	1
our	1
faith,	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
the	1
Fatherland!	1
We	1
must	1
cease	1
raving	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
sons	1
of	1
our	1
Fatherland!	1
We	1
will	1
show	1
Europe	1
how	1
Russia	1
rises	1
to	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
Russia!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
in	1
a	1
word.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
words,	1
apart	1
from	1
what	1
meaning	1
they	1
conveyed,	1
were	1
less	1
audible	1
than	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
opponent's	1
voice.	1
	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
was	1
expressing	1
approval;	1
several	1
persons,	1
briskly	1
turning	1
a	1
shoulder	1
to	1
the	1
orator	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
phrase,	1
said:	1
	1
"That's	1
right,	1
quite	1
right!	1
Just	1
so!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
his	1
money,	1
his	1
serfs,	1
or	1
himself,	1
only	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
affairs	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
improve	1
it,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
speak.	1
Many	1
voices	1
shouted	1
and	1
talked	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
so	1
that	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
signify	1
his	1
approval	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
group	1
increased,	1
dispersed,	1
re-formed,	1
and	1
then	1
moved	1
with	1
a	1
hum	1
of	1
talk	1
into	1
the	1
largest	1
hall	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
table.	1
Not	1
only	1
was	1
Pierre's	1
attempt	1
to	1
speak	1
unsuccessful,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
rudely	1
interrupted,	1
pushed	1
aside,	1
and	1
people	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
common	1
enemy.	1
This	1
happened	1
not	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
displeased	1
by	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
his	1
speech,	1
which	1
had	1
even	1
been	1
forgotten	1
after	1
the	1
many	1
subsequent	1
speeches,	1
but	1
to	1
animate	1
it	1
the	1
crowd	1
needed	1
a	1
tangible	1
object	1
to	1
love	1
and	1
a	1
tangible	1
object	1
to	1
hate.	1
Pierre	1
became	1
the	1
latter.	1
Many	1
other	1
orators	1
spoke	1
after	1
the	1
excited	1
nobleman,	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone.	1
Many	1
spoke	1
eloquently	1
and	1
with	1
originality.	1
	1
Glinka,	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
Messenger,	1
who	1
was	1
recognized	1
(cries	1
of	1
"author!	1
author!"	1
were	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
crowd),	1
said	1
that	1
"hell	1
must	1
be	1
repulsed	1
by	1
hell,"	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
child	1
smiling	1
at	1
lightning	1
flashes	1
and	1
thunderclaps,	1
but	1
"we	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
child."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
at	1
thunderclaps!"	1
was	1
repeated	1
approvingly	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
rows	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
The	1
crowd	1
drew	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
table,	1
at	1
which	1
sat	1
gray-haired	1
or	1
bald	1
seventy-year-old	1
magnates,	1
uniformed	1
and	1
besashed	1
almost	1
all	1
of	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
homes	1
with	1
their	1
buffoons,	1
or	1
playing	1
boston	1
at	1
the	1
clubs.	1
With	1
an	1
incessant	1
hum	1
of	1
voices	1
the	1
crowd	1
advanced	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1
Pressed	1
by	1
the	1
throng	1
against	1
the	1
high	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
chairs,	1
the	1
orators	1
spoke	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
and	1
sometimes	1
two	1
together.	1
Those	1
standing	1
behind	1
noticed	1
what	1
a	1
speaker	1
omitted	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
supply	1
it.	1
Others	1
in	1
that	1
heat	1
and	1
crush	1
racked	1
their	1
brains	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
thought	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
utter	1
it.	1
The	1
old	1
magnates,	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
knew,	1
sat	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
first	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
another,	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
only	1
expressed	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
it	1
very	1
hot.	1
Pierre,	1
however,	1
felt	1
excited,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
desire	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
all	1
lengths--which	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
the	1
tones	1
and	1
looks	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
speeches--infected	1
him	1
too.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
renounce	1
his	1
opinions,	1
but	1
felt	1
himself	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
justify	1
himself.	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
to	1
make	1
sacrifices	1
when	1
we	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
needed!"	1
said	1
he,	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
voices.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
looked	1
round,	1
but	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
immediately	1
diverted	1
by	1
an	1
exclamation	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Moscow	1
will	1
be	1
surrendered!	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
our	1
expiation!"	1
shouted	1
one	1
man.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
mankind!"	1
cried	1
another.	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
speak...."	1
"Gentlemen,	1
you	1
are	1
crushing	1
me!..."	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIII	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
with	1
his	1
protruding	1
chin	1
and	1
alert	1
eyes,	1
wearing	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
with	1
sash	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
stepping	1
briskly	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
gentry.	1
	1
"Our	1
sovereign	1
the	1
Emperor	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
moment,"	1
said	1
Rostopchin.	1
"I	1
am	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1
palace.	1
Seeing	1
the	1
position	1
we	1
are	1
in,	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
need	1
for	1
discussion.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
has	1
deigned	1
to	1
summon	1
us	1
and	1
the	1
merchants.	1
Millions	1
will	1
pour	1
forth	1
from	1
there"--he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
merchants'	1
hall--"but	1
our	1
business	1
is	1
to	1
supply	1
men	1
and	1
not	1
spare	1
ourselves...	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
least	1
we	1
can	1
do!"	1
	1
A	1
conference	1
took	1
place	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
magnates	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table.	1
The	1
whole	1
consultation	1
passed	1
more	1
than	1
quietly.	1
After	1
all	1
the	1
preceding	1
noise	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
old	1
voices	1
saying	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
"I	1
agree,"	1
or	1
for	1
variety,	1
"I	1
too	1
am	1
of	1
that	1
opinion,"	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
had	1
even	1
a	1
mournful	1
effect.	1
	1
The	1
secretary	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
write	1
down	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
nobility	1
and	1
gentry,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
furnish	1
ten	1
men,	1
fully	1
equipped,	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
thousand	1
serfs,	1
as	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
gentry	1
had	1
done.	1
Their	1
chairs	1
made	1
a	1
scraping	1
noise	1
as	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
had	1
conferred	1
rose	1
with	1
apparent	1
relief,	1
and	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
arm	1
in	1
arm,	1
to	1
stretch	1
their	1
legs	1
and	1
converse	1
in	1
couples.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor!	1
The	1
Emperor!"	1
a	1
sudden	1
cry	1
resounded	1
through	1
the	1
halls	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
throng	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
entrance.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
entered	1
the	1
hall	1
through	1
a	1
broad	1
path	1
between	1
two	1
lines	1
of	1
nobles.	1
Every	1
face	1
expressed	1
respectful,	1
awe-struck	1
curiosity.	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
rather	1
far	1
off	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
said.	1
From	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
hear	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
threatening	1
the	1
empire	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
hopes	1
he	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
Moscow	1
nobility.	1
He	1
was	1
answered	1
by	1
a	1
voice	1
which	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
resolution	1
just	1
arrived	1
at.	1
	1
"Gentlemen!"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor	1
with	1
a	1
quivering	1
voice.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
rustling	1
among	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
it	1
again	1
subsided,	1
so	1
that	1
Pierre	1
distinctly	1
heard	1
the	1
pleasantly	1
human	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
saying	1
with	1
emotion:	1
	1
"I	1
never	1
doubted	1
the	1
devotion	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
nobles,	1
but	1
today	1
it	1
has	1
surpassed	1
my	1
expectations.	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Fatherland!	1
Gentlemen,	1
let	1
us	1
act!	1
Time	1
is	1
most	1
precious..."	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
ceased	1
speaking,	1
the	1
crowd	1
began	1
pressing	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
rapturous	1
exclamations	1
were	1
heard	1
from	1
all	1
sides.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
most	1
precious...	1
a	1
royal	1
word,"	1
said	1
Count	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
a	1
sob.	1
He	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
back,	1
and,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
hardly	1
anything,	1
understood	1
everything	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
the	1
Emperor	1
went	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
merchants.	1
There	1
he	1
remained	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
saw	1
him	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
merchants'	1
hall	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
emotion	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
As	1
became	1
known	1
later,	1
he	1
had	1
scarcely	1
begun	1
to	1
address	1
the	1
merchants	1
before	1
tears	1
gushed	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
concluded	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
the	1
Emperor	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
out	1
accompanied	1
by	1
two	1
merchants,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
knew,	1
a	1
fat	1
otkupshchik.	1
The	1
other	1
was	1
the	1
mayor,	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
thin	1
sallow	1
face	1
and	1
narrow	1
beard.	1
Both	1
were	1
weeping.	1
Tears	1
filled	1
the	1
thin	1
man's	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
otkupshchik	1
sobbed	1
outright	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
kept	1
repeating:	1
	1
"Our	1
lives	1
and	1
property--take	1
them,	1
Your	1
Majesty!"	1
	1
Pierre's	1
one	1
feeling	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
was	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
all	1
lengths	1
and	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
everything.	1
He	1
now	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
its	1
constitutional	1
tendency	1
and	1
sought	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
effacing	1
it.	1
Having	1
heard	1
that	1
Count	1
Mamonov	1
was	1
furnishing	1
a	1
regiment,	1
Bezukhov	1
at	1
once	1
informed	1
Rostopchin	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
a	1
thousand	1
men	1
and	1
their	1
maintenance.	1
	1
Old	1
Rostov	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
his	1
wife	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
without	1
tears,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
consented	1
to	1
Petya's	1
request	1
and	1
went	1
himself	1
to	1
enter	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
Emperor	1
left	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
assembled	1
nobles	1
all	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
uniforms	1
and	1
settled	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
their	1
homes	1
and	1
clubs,	1
and	1
not	1
without	1
some	1
groans	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
their	1
stewards	1
about	1
the	1
enrollment,	1
feeling	1
amazed	1
themselves	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
done.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Napoleon	1
began	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Russia	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
going	1
to	1
Dresden,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
having	1
his	1
head	1
turned	1
by	1
the	1
homage	1
he	1
received,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
donning	1
a	1
Polish	1
uniform	1
and	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
stimulating	1
influence	1
of	1
a	1
June	1
morning,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
bursts	1
of	1
anger	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Kurakin	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
Balashev.	1
	1
Alexander	1
refused	1
negotiations	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
personally	1
insulted.	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly	1
tried	1
to	1
command	1
the	1
army	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
way,	1
because	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
fulfill	1
his	1
duty	1
and	1
earn	1
fame	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
commander.	1
Rostov	1
charged	1
the	1
French	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
his	1
wish	1
for	1
a	1
gallop	1
across	1
a	1
level	1
field;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
the	1
innumerable	1
people	1
who	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
war	1
acted	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
their	1
personal	1
characteristics,	1
habits,	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
aims.	1
They	1
were	1
moved	1
by	1
fear	1
or	1
vanity,	1
rejoiced	1
or	1
were	1
indignant,	1
reasoned,	1
imagining	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
and	1
did	1
it	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
free	1
will,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
were	1
involuntary	1
tools	1
of	1
history,	1
carrying	1
on	1
a	1
work	1
concealed	1
from	1
them	1
but	1
comprehensible	1
to	1
us.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
inevitable	1
fate	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
action,	1
and	1
the	1
higher	1
they	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
social	1
hierarchy	1
the	1
less	1
are	1
they	1
free.	1
	1
The	1
actors	1
of	1
1812	1
have	1
long	1
since	1
left	1
the	1
stage,	1
their	1
personal	1
interests	1
have	1
vanished	1
leaving	1
no	1
trace,	1
and	1
nothing	1
remains	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
but	1
its	1
historic	1
results.	1
	1
Providence	1
compelled	1
all	1
these	1
men,	1
striving	1
to	1
attain	1
personal	1
aims,	1
to	1
further	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
a	1
stupendous	1
result	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
all	1
expected--neither	1
Napoleon,	1
nor	1
Alexander,	1
nor	1
still	1
less	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
the	1
actual	1
fighting.	1
	1
The	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
in	1
1812	1
is	1
clear	1
to	1
us	1
now.	1
No	1
one	1
will	1
deny	1
that	1
that	1
cause	1
was,	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
its	1
advance	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Russia	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
without	1
any	1
preparation	1
for	1
a	1
winter	1
campaign	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
character	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
by	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Russian	1
towns	1
and	1
the	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
foe	1
this	1
aroused	1
among	1
the	1
Russian	1
people.	1
But	1
no	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
foresaw	1
(what	1
now	1
seems	1
so	1
evident)	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
eight	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men--the	1
best	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
best	1
general--could	1
be	1
destroyed	1
in	1
conflict	1
with	1
a	1
raw	1
army	1
of	1
half	1
its	1
numerical	1
strength,	1
and	1
led	1
by	1
inexperienced	1
commanders	1
as	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was.	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
no	1
one	1
see	1
this,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
side	1
every	1
effort	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
hinder	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
save	1
Russia,	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
French	1
side,	1
despite	1
Napoleon's	1
experience	1
and	1
so-called	1
military	1
genius,	1
every	1
effort	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
pushing	1
on	1
to	1
Moscow	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
summer,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
doing	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
lead	1
to	1
destruction.	1
	1
In	1
historical	1
works	1
on	1
the	1
year	1
1812	1
French	1
writers	1
are	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
saying	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
felt	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
extending	1
his	1
line,	1
that	1
he	1
sought	1
a	1
battle	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
marshals	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
stop	1
at	1
Smolensk,	1
and	1
of	1
making	1
similar	1
statements	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
was	1
even	1
then	1
understood.	1
Russian	1
authors	1
are	1
still	1
fonder	1
of	1
telling	1
us	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
a	1
Scythian	1
war	1
plan	1
was	1
adopted	1
to	1
lure	1
Napoleon	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
Russia,	1
and	1
this	1
plan	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
attribute	1
to	1
Pfuel,	1
others	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
Frenchman,	1
others	1
to	1
Toll,	1
and	1
others	1
again	1
to	1
Alexander	1
himself--pointing	1
to	1
notes,	1
projects,	1
and	1
letters	1
which	1
contain	1
hints	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
action.	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
hints	1
at	1
what	1
happened,	1
both	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
Russian,	1
are	1
advanced	1
only	1
because	1
they	1
fit	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
event.	1
Had	1
that	1
event	1
not	1
occurred	1
these	1
hints	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
forgotten,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
thousands	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
hints	1
and	1
expectations	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
which	1
were	1
current	1
then	1
but	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
forgotten	1
because	1
the	1
event	1
falsified	1
them.	1
There	1
are	1
always	1
so	1
many	1
conjectures	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
any	1
event	1
that	1
however	1
it	1
may	1
end	1
there	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
people	1
to	1
say:	1
"I	1
said	1
then	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
so,"	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
that	1
amid	1
their	1
innumerable	1
conjectures	1
many	1
were	1
to	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
effect.	1
	1
Conjectures	1
as	1
to	1
Napoleon's	1
awareness	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
extending	1
his	1
line,	1
and	1
(on	1
the	1
Russian	1
side)	1
as	1
to	1
luring	1
the	1
enemy	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
Russia,	1
are	1
evidently	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
much	1
straining	1
can	1
historians	1
attribute	1
such	1
conceptions	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
marshals,	1
or	1
such	1
plans	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders.	1
All	1
the	1
facts	1
are	1
in	1
flat	1
contradiction	1
to	1
such	1
conjectures.	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
wish	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
side	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
French	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
but	1
from	1
their	1
first	1
entry	1
into	1
Russia	1
everything	1
was	1
done	1
to	1
stop	1
them.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
Napoleon	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
extend	1
his	1
line,	1
but	1
he	1
welcomed	1
every	1
step	1
forward	1
as	1
a	1
triumph	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
seek	1
battle	1
as	1
eagerly	1
as	1
in	1
former	1
campaigns,	1
but	1
very	1
lazily.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
our	1
armies	1
were	1
divided,	1
and	1
our	1
sole	1
aim	1
was	1
to	1
unite	1
them,	1
though	1
uniting	1
the	1
armies	1
was	1
no	1
advantage	1
if	1
we	1
meant	1
to	1
retire	1
and	1
lure	1
the	1
enemy	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
Our	1
Emperor	1
joined	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
encourage	1
it	1
to	1
defend	1
every	1
inch	1
of	1
Russian	1
soil	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
retreat.	1
The	1
enormous	1
Drissa	1
camp	1
was	1
formed	1
on	1
Pfuel's	1
plan,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
retiring	1
farther.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
reproached	1
the	1
commanders	1
in	1
chief	1
for	1
every	1
step	1
they	1
retired.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
letting	1
the	1
enemy	1
even	1
reach	1
Smolensk,	1
still	1
less	1
could	1
he	1
contemplate	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
when	1
our	1
armies	1
did	1
unite	1
he	1
was	1
displeased	1
that	1
Smolensk	1
was	1
abandoned	1
and	1
burned	1
without	1
a	1
general	1
engagement	1
having	1
been	1
fought	1
under	1
its	1
walls.	1
	1
So	1
thought	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
and	1
people	1
were	1
still	1
more	1
provoked	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
our	1
forces	1
were	1
retreating	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
having	1
cut	1
our	1
armies	1
apart	1
advanced	1
far	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
missed	1
several	1
chances	1
of	1
forcing	1
an	1
engagement.	1
In	1
August	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
advance	1
farther,	1
though	1
as	1
we	1
now	1
see	1
that	1
advance	1
was	1
evidently	1
ruinous	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
facts	1
clearly	1
show	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
foresee	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
advance	1
on	1
Moscow,	1
nor	1
did	1
Alexander	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
then	1
think	1
of	1
luring	1
Napoleon	1
on,	1
but	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary.	1
The	1
luring	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
any	1
plan,	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
possible;	1
it	1
resulted	1
from	1
a	1
most	1
complex	1
interplay	1
of	1
intrigues,	1
aims,	1
and	1
wishes	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
perception	1
whatever	1
of	1
the	1
inevitable,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
way	1
of	1
saving	1
Russia.	1
Everything	1
came	1
about	1
fortuitously.	1
The	1
armies	1
were	1
divided	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
campaign.	1
We	1
tried	1
to	1
unite	1
them,	1
with	1
the	1
evident	1
intention	1
of	1
giving	1
battle	1
and	1
checking	1
the	1
enemy's	1
advance,	1
and	1
by	1
this	1
effort	1
to	1
unite	1
them	1
while	1
avoiding	1
battle	1
with	1
a	1
much	1
stronger	1
enemy,	1
and	1
necessarily	1
withdrawing	1
the	1
armies	1
at	1
an	1
acute	1
angle--we	1
led	1
the	1
French	1
on	1
to	1
Smolensk.	1
But	1
we	1
withdrew	1
at	1
an	1
acute	1
angle	1
not	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
French	1
advanced	1
between	1
our	1
two	1
armies;	1
the	1
angle	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
acute	1
and	1
we	1
withdrew	1
still	1
farther,	1
because	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly	1
was	1
an	1
unpopular	1
foreigner	1
disliked	1
by	1
Bagration	1
(who	1
would	1
come	1
under	1
his	1
command),	1
and	1
Bagration--being	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
army--tried	1
to	1
postpone	1
joining	1
up	1
and	1
coming	1
under	1
Barclay's	1
command	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
could.	1
Bagration	1
was	1
slow	1
in	1
effecting	1
the	1
junction--though	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
aim	1
of	1
all	1
at	1
headquarters--because,	1
as	1
he	1
alleged,	1
he	1
exposed	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
danger	1
on	1
this	1
march,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
best	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
retire	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
south,	1
worrying	1
the	1
enemy	1
from	1
flank	1
and	1
rear	1
and	1
securing	1
from	1
the	1
Ukraine	1
recruits	1
for	1
his	1
army;	1
and	1
it	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
planned	1
this	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
come	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
detested	1
foreigner	1
Barclay,	1
whose	1
rank	1
was	1
inferior	1
to	1
his	1
own.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
encourage	1
it,	1
but	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
ignorance	1
of	1
what	1
steps	1
to	1
take,	1
and	1
the	1
enormous	1
number	1
of	1
advisers	1
and	1
plans,	1
destroyed	1
the	1
first	1
army's	1
energy	1
and	1
it	1
retired.	1
	1
The	1
intention	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
Drissa	1
camp,	1
but	1
Paulucci,	1
aiming	1
at	1
becoming	1
commander-in-chief,	1
unexpectedly	1
employed	1
his	1
energy	1
to	1
influence	1
Alexander,	1
and	1
Pfuel's	1
whole	1
plan	1
was	1
abandoned	1
and	1
the	1
command	1
entrusted	1
to	1
Barclay.	1
But	1
as	1
Barclay	1
did	1
not	1
inspire	1
confidence	1
his	1
power	1
was	1
limited.	1
The	1
armies	1
were	1
divided,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
unity	1
of	1
command,	1
and	1
Barclay	1
was	1
unpopular;	1
but	1
from	1
this	1
confusion,	1
division,	1
and	1
the	1
unpopularity	1
of	1
the	1
foreign	1
commander-in-chief,	1
there	1
resulted	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
indecision	1
and	1
the	1
avoidance	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
(which	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
refrained	1
from	1
had	1
the	1
armies	1
been	1
united	1
and	1
had	1
someone	1
else,	1
instead	1
of	1
Barclay,	1
been	1
in	1
command)	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
an	1
ever-increasing	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
foreigners	1
and	1
an	1
increase	1
in	1
patriotic	1
zeal.	1
	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
Emperor	1
left	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
convenient	1
and	1
indeed	1
the	1
only	1
pretext	1
for	1
his	1
departure	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
inspire	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
capitals	1
and	1
arouse	1
the	1
nation	1
in	1
general	1
to	1
a	1
patriotic	1
war.	1
And	1
by	1
this	1
visit	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
Moscow	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
trebled.	1
	1
He	1
left	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
obstruct	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
undivided	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
hoping	1
that	1
more	1
decisive	1
action	1
would	1
then	1
be	1
taken,	1
but	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
confused	1
and	1
enfeebled.	1
Bennigsen,	1
the	1
Tsarevich,	1
and	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
adjutants	1
general	1
remained	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
under	1
observation	1
and	1
arouse	1
his	1
energy,	1
and	1
Barclay,	1
feeling	1
less	1
free	1
than	1
ever	1
under	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
"eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor,"	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
cautious	1
of	1
undertaking	1
any	1
decisive	1
action	1
and	1
avoided	1
giving	1
battle.	1
	1
Barclay	1
stood	1
for	1
caution.	1
The	1
Tsarevich	1
hinted	1
at	1
treachery	1
and	1
demanded	1
a	1
general	1
engagement.	1
Lubomirski,	1
Bronnitski,	1
Wlocki,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
of	1
that	1
group	1
stirred	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
trouble	1
that	1
Barclay,	1
under	1
pretext	1
of	1
sending	1
papers	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
dispatched	1
these	1
Polish	1
adjutants	1
general	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
plunged	1
into	1
an	1
open	1
struggle	1
with	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
the	1
Tsarevich.	1
	1
At	1
Smolensk	1
the	1
armies	1
at	1
last	1
reunited,	1
much	1
as	1
Bagration	1
disliked	1
it.	1
	1
Bagration	1
drove	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
occupied	1
by	1
Barclay.	1
Barclay	1
donned	1
his	1
sash	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
and	1
report	1
to	1
his	1
senior	1
officer	1
Bagration.	1
	1
Despite	1
his	1
seniority	1
in	1
rank	1
Bagration,	1
in	1
this	1
contest	1
of	1
magnanimity,	1
took	1
his	1
orders	1
from	1
Barclay,	1
but,	1
having	1
submitted,	1
agreed	1
with	1
him	1
less	1
than	1
ever.	1
By	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
orders	1
Bagration	1
reported	1
direct	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
wrote	1
to	1
Arakcheev,	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
confidant:	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
as	1
my	1
sovereign	1
pleases,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
work	1
with	1
the	1
Minister	1
(meaning	1
Barclay).	1
For	1
God's	1
sake	1
send	1
me	1
somewhere	1
else	1
if	1
only	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
regiment.	1
I	1
cannot	1
stand	1
it	1
here.	1
Headquarters	1
are	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
Germans	1
that	1
a	1
Russian	1
cannot	1
exist	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sense	1
in	1
anything.	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
was	1
really	1
serving	1
my	1
sovereign	1
and	1
the	1
Fatherland,	1
but	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
serving	1
Barclay.	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to."	1
	1
The	1
swarm	1
of	1
Bronnitskis	1
and	1
Wintzingerodes	1
and	1
their	1
like	1
still	1
further	1
embittered	1
the	1
relations	1
between	1
the	1
commanders	1
in	1
chief,	1
and	1
even	1
less	1
unity	1
resulted.	1
Preparations	1
were	1
made	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
French	1
before	1
Smolensk.	1
A	1
general	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
survey	1
the	1
position.	1
This	1
general,	1
hating	1
Barclay,	1
rode	1
to	1
visit	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
a	1
corps	1
commander,	1
and,	1
having	1
spent	1
the	1
day	1
with	1
him,	1
returned	1
to	1
Barclay	1
and	1
condemned,	1
as	1
unsuitable	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
the	1
battleground	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen.	1
	1
While	1
disputes	1
and	1
intrigues	1
were	1
going	1
on	1
about	1
the	1
future	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
and	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
French--having	1
lost	1
touch	1
with	1
them--the	1
French	1
stumbled	1
upon	1
Neverovski's	1
division	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Smolensk.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
fight	1
an	1
unexpected	1
battle	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
to	1
save	1
our	1
lines	1
of	1
communication.	1
The	1
battle	1
was	1
fought	1
and	1
thousands	1
were	1
killed	1
on	1
both	1
sides.	1
	1
Smolensk	1
was	1
abandoned	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
people.	1
But	1
Smolensk	1
was	1
burned	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
inhabitants-who	1
had	1
been	1
misled	1
by	1
their	1
governor.	1
And	1
these	1
ruined	1
inhabitants,	1
setting	1
an	1
example	1
to	1
other	1
Russians,	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
losses	1
but	1
kindling	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
foe.	1
Napoleon	1
advanced	1
farther	1
and	1
we	1
retired,	1
thus	1
arriving	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
result	1
which	1
caused	1
his	1
destruction.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
left,	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
sent	1
for	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
study.	1
	1
"Well?	1
Are	1
you	1
satisfied	1
now?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You've	1
made	1
me	1
quarrel	1
with	1
my	1
son!	1
Satisfied,	1
are	1
you?	1
That's	1
all	1
you	1
wanted!	1
Satisfied?...	1
It	1
hurts	1
me,	1
it	1
hurts.	1
I'm	1
old	1
and	1
weak	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
wanted.	1
Well	1
then,	1
gloat	1
over	1
it!	1
Gloat	1
over	1
it!"	1
	1
After	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
week.	1
He	1
was	1
ill	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
his	1
study.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
noticed	1
to	1
her	1
surprise	1
that	1
during	1
this	1
illness	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
not	1
only	1
excluded	1
her	1
from	1
his	1
room,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
either.	1
Tikhon	1
alone	1
attended	1
him.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
the	1
prince	1
reappeared	1
and	1
resumed	1
his	1
former	1
way	1
of	1
life,	1
devoting	1
himself	1
with	1
special	1
activity	1
to	1
building	1
operations	1
and	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
gardens	1
and	1
completely	1
breaking	1
off	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
His	1
looks	1
and	1
cold	1
tone	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"There,	1
you	1
see?	1
You	1
plotted	1
against	1
me,	1
you	1
lied	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
about	1
my	1
relations	1
with	1
that	1
Frenchwoman	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
quarrel	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
need	1
neither	1
her	1
nor	1
you!"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
spent	1
half	1
of	1
every	1
day	1
with	1
little	1
Nicholas,	1
watching	1
his	1
lessons,	1
teaching	1
him	1
Russian	1
and	1
music	1
herself,	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
Dessalles;	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
she	1
spent	1
over	1
her	1
books,	1
with	1
her	1
old	1
nurse,	1
or	1
with	1
"God's	1
folk"	1
who	1
sometimes	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
door	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
	1
Of	1
the	1
war	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
thought	1
as	1
women	1
do	1
think	1
about	1
wars.	1
She	1
feared	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
it,	1
was	1
horrified	1
by	1
and	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
cruelty	1
that	1
impels	1
men	1
to	1
kill	1
one	1
another,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
war,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
like	1
all	1
previous	1
wars.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
war,	1
though	1
Dessalles	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
constantly	1
conversed	1
was	1
passionately	1
interested	1
in	1
its	1
progress	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
own	1
conception	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
"God's	1
folk"	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
reported,	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
way,	1
the	1
rumors	1
current	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
an	1
invasion	1
by	1
Antichrist,	1
and	1
though	1
Julie	1
(now	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya),	1
who	1
had	1
resumed	1
correspondence	1
with	1
her,	1
wrote	1
patriotic	1
letters	1
from	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"I	1
write	1
you	1
in	1
Russian,	1
my	1
good	1
friend,"	1
wrote	1
Julie	1
in	1
her	1
Frenchified	1
Russian,	1
"because	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
detestation	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
for	1
their	1
language	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
support	1
to	1
hear	1
spoken....	1
We	1
in	1
Moscow	1
are	1
elated	1
by	1
enthusiasm	1
for	1
our	1
adored	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"My	1
poor	1
husband	1
is	1
enduring	1
pains	1
and	1
hunger	1
in	1
Jewish	1
taverns,	1
but	1
the	1
news	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
inspires	1
me	1
yet	1
more.	1
	1
"You	1
heard	1
probably	1
of	1
the	1
heroic	1
exploit	1
of	1
Raevski,	1
embracing	1
his	1
two	1
sons	1
and	1
saying:	1
'I	1
will	1
perish	1
with	1
them	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
shaken!'	1
And	1
truly	1
though	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
twice	1
stronger	1
than	1
we,	1
we	1
were	1
unshakable.	1
We	1
pass	1
the	1
time	1
as	1
we	1
can,	1
but	1
in	1
war	1
as	1
in	1
war!	1
The	1
princesses	1
Aline	1
and	1
Sophie	1
sit	1
whole	1
days	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
we,	1
unhappy	1
widows	1
of	1
live	1
men,	1
make	1
beautiful	1
conversations	1
over	1
our	1
'charpie',	1
only	1
you,	1
my	1
friend,	1
are	1
missing..."	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
chief	1
reason	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
the	1
full	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
war	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
never	1
spoke	1
of	1
it,	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
it,	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
Dessalles	1
when	1
he	1
mentioned	1
it	1
at	1
dinner.	1
The	1
prince's	1
tone	1
was	1
so	1
calm	1
and	1
confident	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
unhesitatingly	1
believed	1
him.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
July	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
active	1
and	1
even	1
animated.	1
He	1
planned	1
another	1
garden	1
and	1
began	1
a	1
new	1
building	1
for	1
the	1
domestic	1
serfs.	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
made	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
anxious	1
about	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
slept	1
very	1
little	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
sleeping	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
as	1
usual,	1
changed	1
his	1
sleeping	1
place	1
every	1
day.	1
One	1
day	1
he	1
would	1
order	1
his	1
camp	1
bed	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
gallery,	1
another	1
day	1
he	1
remained	1
on	1
the	1
couch	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
lounge	1
chair	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
dozed	1
there	1
without	1
undressing,	1
while--instead	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne--a	1
serf	1
boy	1
read	1
to	1
him.	1
Then	1
again	1
he	1
would	1
spend	1
a	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room.	1
	1
On	1
August	1
1,	1
a	1
second	1
letter	1
was	1
received	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
In	1
his	1
first	1
letter	1
which	1
came	1
soon	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
home,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
dutifully	1
asked	1
his	1
father's	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
begged	1
to	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
his	1
favor.	1
To	1
this	1
letter	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
replied	1
affectionately,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
had	1
kept	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
at	1
a	1
distance.	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
second	1
letter,	1
written	1
near	1
Vitebsk	1
after	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
occupied	1
that	1
town,	1
gave	1
a	1
brief	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign,	1
enclosed	1
for	1
them	1
a	1
plan	1
he	1
had	1
drawn	1
and	1
forecasts	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
further	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
war.	1
In	1
this	1
letter	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
staying	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
so	1
near	1
the	1
theater	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
army's	1
direct	1
line	1
of	1
march,	1
and	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
move	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
At	1
dinner	1
that	1
day,	1
on	1
Dessalles'	1
mentioning	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
already	1
entered	1
Vitebsk,	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
remembered	1
his	1
son's	1
letter.	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
today,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary-	1
-"Haven't	1
you	1
read	1
it?"	1
	1
"No,	1
Father,"	1
she	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
voice.	1
	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
it	1
had	1
arrived.	1
	1
"He	1
writes	1
about	1
this	1
war,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
with	1
the	1
ironic	1
smile	1
that	1
had	1
become	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
war.	1
	1
"That	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
interesting,"	1
said	1
Dessalles.	1
"Prince	1
Andrew	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
know..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
very	1
interesting!"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
"Go	1
and	1
get	1
it	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
"You	1
know--under	1
the	1
paperweight	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
table."	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
jumped	1
up	1
eagerly.	1
	1
"No,	1
don't!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
"You	1
go,	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich."	1
	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
study.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
looking	1
uneasily	1
round,	1
threw	1
down	1
his	1
napkin	1
and	1
went	1
himself.	1
	1
"They	1
can't	1
do	1
anything...	1
always	1
make	1
some	1
muddle,"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
away	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
Dessalles,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
and	1
even	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
exchanged	1
looks	1
in	1
silence.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
returned	1
with	1
quick	1
steps,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
bringing	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
a	1
plan.	1
These	1
he	1
put	1
down	1
beside	1
him--not	1
letting	1
anyone	1
read	1
them	1
at	1
dinner.	1
	1
On	1
moving	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
handed	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and,	1
spreading	1
out	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
building	1
and	1
fixing	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
it,	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
aloud.	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
her	1
father.	1
He	1
was	1
examining	1
the	1
plan,	1
evidently	1
engrossed	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
ideas.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
Prince?"	1
Dessalles	1
ventured	1
to	1
ask.	1
	1
"I?	1
I?..."	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
as	1
if	1
unpleasantly	1
awakened,	1
and	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
building.	1
	1
"Very	1
possibly	1
the	1
theater	1
of	1
war	1
will	1
move	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
us	1
that..."	1
	1
"Ha	1
ha	1
ha!	1
The	1
theater	1
of	1
war!"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"I	1
have	1
said	1
and	1
still	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
theater	1
of	1
war	1
is	1
Poland	1
and	1
the	1
enemy	1
will	1
never	1
get	1
beyond	1
the	1
Niemen."	1
	1
Dessalles	1
looked	1
in	1
amazement	1
at	1
the	1
prince,	1
who	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
Niemen	1
when	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
already	1
at	1
the	1
Dnieper,	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
forgetting	1
the	1
geographical	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Niemen,	1
thought	1
that	1
what	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
correct.	1
	1
"When	1
the	1
snow	1
melts	1
they'll	1
sink	1
in	1
the	1
Polish	1
swamps.	1
Only	1
they	1
could	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
it,"	1
the	1
prince	1
continued,	1
evidently	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1807	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
recent.	1
"Bennigsen	1
should	1
have	1
advanced	1
into	1
Prussia	1
sooner,	1
then	1
things	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
a	1
different	1
turn..."	1
	1
"But,	1
Prince,"	1
Dessalles	1
began	1
timidly,	1
"the	1
letter	1
mentions	1
Vitebsk...."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
the	1
letter?	1
Yes..."	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
peevishly.	1
"Yes...	1
yes..."	1
His	1
face	1
suddenly	1
took	1
on	1
a	1
morose	1
expression.	1
He	1
paused.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
writes	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
beaten	1
at...	1
at...	1
what	1
river	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
Dessalles	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"The	1
prince	1
says	1
nothing	1
about	1
that,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
gently.	1
	1
"Doesn't	1
he?	1
But	1
I	1
didn't	1
invent	1
it	1
myself."	1
	1
No	1
one	1
spoke	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
"Yes...	1
yes...	1
Well,	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
went	1
on,	1
raising	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
building,	1
"tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
alter	1
it...."	1
	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
plan,	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
after	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
building	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Dessalles	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
room.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
saw	1
Dessalles'	1
embarrassed	1
and	1
astonished	1
look	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
father,	1
noticed	1
his	1
silence,	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
forgotten	1
his	1
son's	1
letter	1
on	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
table;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
ask	1
Dessalles	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
confusion	1
and	1
silence,	1
but	1
was	1
afraid	1
even	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
sent	1
by	1
the	1
prince,	1
came	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
for	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
letter	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
She	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
unpleasant	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
ventured	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
what	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
doing.	1
	1
"Always	1
busy,"	1
replied	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
with	1
a	1
respectfully	1
ironic	1
smile	1
which	1
caused	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
turn	1
pale.	1
"He's	1
worrying	1
very	1
much	1
about	1
the	1
new	1
building.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
reading	1
a	1
little,	1
but	1
now"--Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
went	1
on,	1
lowering	1
his	1
voice--"now	1
he's	1
at	1
his	1
desk,	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
will,	1
I	1
expect."	1
(One	1
of	1
the	1
prince's	1
favorite	1
occupations	1
of	1
late	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
some	1
papers	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
leave	1
at	1
his	1
death	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
"will.")	1
	1
"And	1
Alpatych	1
is	1
being	1
sent	1
to	1
Smolensk?"	1
asked	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
waiting	1
to	1
start	1
for	1
some	1
time."	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
When	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
study	1
with	1
the	1
letter,	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
with	1
spectacles	1
on	1
and	1
a	1
shade	1
over	1
his	1
eyes,	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
his	1
open	1
bureau	1
with	1
screened	1
candles,	1
holding	1
a	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
outstretched	1
hand,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
somewhat	1
dramatic	1
attitude	1
was	1
reading	1
his	1
manuscript--	1
his	1
"Remarks"	1
as	1
he	1
termed	1
it--which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
transmitted	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
after	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
When	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
went	1
in	1
there	1
were	1
tears	1
in	1
the	1
prince's	1
eyes	1
evoked	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
paper	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
reading	1
had	1
been	1
written.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich's	1
hand,	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
folded	1
up	1
his	1
papers,	1
and	1
called	1
in	1
Alpatych	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
waiting.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
had	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
bought	1
in	1
Smolensk	1
and,	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
past	1
Alpatych	1
who	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
door,	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
instructions.	1
	1
"First,	1
notepaper--do	1
you	1
hear?	1
Eight	1
quires,	1
like	1
this	1
sample,	1
gilt-	1
edged...	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
exactly	1
like	1
the	1
sample.	1
Varnish,	1
sealing	1
wax,	1
as	1
in	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich's	1
list."	1
	1
He	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
notes.	1
	1
"Then	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
governor	1
in	1
person	1
a	1
letter	1
about	1
the	1
deed."	1
	1
Next,	1
bolts	1
for	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
building	1
were	1
wanted	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
special	1
shape	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
himself	1
designed,	1
and	1
a	1
leather	1
case	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
ordered	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
"will"	1
in.	1
	1
The	1
instructions	1
to	1
Alpatych	1
took	1
over	1
two	1
hours	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
prince	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
He	1
sat	1
down,	1
sank	1
into	1
thought,	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
dozed	1
off.	1
Alpatych	1
made	1
a	1
slight	1
movement.	1
	1
"Well,	1
go,	1
go!	1
If	1
anything	1
more	1
is	1
wanted	1
I'll	1
send	1
after	1
you."	1
	1
Alpatych	1
went	1
out.	1
The	1
prince	1
again	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
bureau,	1
glanced	1
into	1
it,	1
fingered	1
his	1
papers,	1
closed	1
the	1
bureau	1
again,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
late	1
when	1
he	1
rose	1
after	1
sealing	1
the	1
letter.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
sleep,	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
and	1
that	1
most	1
depressing	1
thoughts	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
bed.	1
So	1
he	1
called	1
Tikhon	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
rooms	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
where	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
bed	1
for	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
He	1
went	1
about	1
looking	1
at	1
every	1
corner.	1
Every	1
place	1
seemed	1
unsatisfactory,	1
but	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
his	1
customary	1
couch	1
in	1
the	1
study.	1
That	1
couch	1
was	1
dreadful	1
to	1
him,	1
probably	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
oppressive	1
thoughts	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
when	1
lying	1
there.	1
It	1
was	1
unsatisfactory	1
everywhere,	1
but	1
the	1
corner	1
behind	1
the	1
piano	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
other	1
places:	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
slept	1
there	1
yet.	1
	1
With	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
a	1
footman	1
Tikhon	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
bedstead	1
and	1
began	1
putting	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
right!	1
That's	1
not	1
right!"	1
cried	1
the	1
prince,	1
and	1
himself	1
pushed	1
it	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
from	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
then	1
closer	1
in	1
again.	1
	1
"Well,	1
at	1
last	1
I've	1
finished,	1
now	1
I'll	1
rest,"	1
thought	1
the	1
prince,	1
and	1
let	1
Tikhon	1
undress	1
him.	1
	1
Frowning	1
with	1
vexation	1
at	1
the	1
effort	1
necessary	1
to	1
divest	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
trousers,	1
the	1
prince	1
undressed,	1
sat	1
down	1
heavily	1
on	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
meditating	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
contemptuously	1
at	1
his	1
withered	1
yellow	1
legs.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
meditating,	1
but	1
only	1
deferring	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
effort	1
to	1
lift	1
those	1
legs	1
up	1
and	1
turn	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
bed.	1
"Ugh,	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
is!	1
Oh,	1
that	1
this	1
toil	1
might	1
end	1
and	1
you	1
would	1
release	1
me!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
Pressing	1
his	1
lips	1
together	1
he	1
made	1
that	1
effort	1
for	1
the	1
twenty-thousandth	1
time	1
and	1
lay	1
down.	1
But	1
hardly	1
had	1
he	1
done	1
so	1
before	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
bed	1
rocking	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards	1
beneath	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
and	1
jolting.	1
This	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
almost	1
every	1
night.	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
closing.	1
	1
"No	1
peace,	1
damn	1
them!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
angry	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
with	1
whom.	1
"Ah	1
yes,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
else	1
important,	1
very	1
important,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
keeping	1
till	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
bed.	1
The	1
bolts?	1
No,	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
them.	1
No,	1
it	1
was	1
something,	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
talked	1
some	1
nonsense.	1
Dessalles,	1
that	1
fool,	1
said	1
something.	1
Something	1
in	1
my	1
pocket--can't	1
remember..."	1
	1
"Tikhon,	1
what	1
did	1
we	1
talk	1
about	1
at	1
dinner?"	1
	1
"About	1
Prince	1
Michael..."	1
	1
"Be	1
quiet,	1
quiet!"	1
The	1
prince	1
slapped	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
know,	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
letter!	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
read	1
it.	1
Dessalles	1
said	1
something	1
about	1
Vitebsk.	1
Now	1
I'll	1
read	1
it."	1
	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
letter	1
taken	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
the	1
table--on	1
which	1
stood	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
lemonade	1
and	1
a	1
spiral	1
wax	1
candle--moved	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
spectacles	1
he	1
began	1
reading.	1
Only	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
reading	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
faint	1
light	1
under	1
the	1
green	1
shade,	1
did	1
he	1
grasp	1
its	1
meaning	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
"The	1
French	1
at	1
Vitebsk,	1
in	1
four	1
days'	1
march	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
Smolensk;	1
perhaps	1
are	1
already	1
there!	1
Tikhon!"	1
Tikhon	1
jumped	1
up.	1
"No,	1
no,	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
anything!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
He	1
put	1
the	1
letter	1
under	1
the	1
candlestick	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
And	1
there	1
rose	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
Danube	1
at	1
bright	1
noonday:	1
reeds,	1
the	1
Russian	1
camp,	1
and	1
himself	1
a	1
young	1
general	1
without	1
a	1
wrinkle	1
on	1
his	1
ruddy	1
face,	1
vigorous	1
and	1
alert,	1
entering	1
Potemkin's	1
gaily	1
colored	1
tent,	1
and	1
a	1
burning	1
sense	1
of	1
jealousy	1
of	1
"the	1
favorite"	1
agitated	1
him	1
now	1
as	1
strongly	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
then.	1
He	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
spoken	1
at	1
that	1
first	1
meeting	1
with	1
Potemkin.	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
before	1
him	1
a	1
plump,	1
rather	1
sallow-	1
faced,	1
short,	1
stout	1
woman,	1
the	1
Empress	1
Mother,	1
with	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
words	1
at	1
her	1
first	1
gracious	1
reception	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
that	1
same	1
face	1
on	1
the	1
catafalque,	1
and	1
the	1
encounter	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
Zubov	1
over	1
her	1
coffin	1
about	1
his	1
right	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
quicker,	1
quicker!	1
To	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
present!	1
Quicker,	1
quicker--and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace!"	1
	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski's	1
estate,	1
lay	1
forty	1
miles	1
east	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
two	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
road	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
The	1
same	1
evening	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
gave	1
his	1
instructions	1
to	1
Alpatych,	1
Dessalles,	1
having	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
told	1
her	1
that,	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
was	1
taking	1
no	1
steps	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
safety,	1
though	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
letter	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
might	1
be	1
dangerous,	1
he	1
respectfully	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
letter	1
by	1
Alpatych	1
to	1
the	1
Provincial	1
Governor	1
at	1
Smolensk,	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
affairs	1
and	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
which	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
was	1
exposed.	1
Dessalles	1
wrote	1
this	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Governor	1
for	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
she	1
signed	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
Alpatych	1
with	1
instructions	1
to	1
hand	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Governor	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
danger.	1
	1
Having	1
received	1
all	1
his	1
orders	1
Alpatych,	1
wearing	1
a	1
white	1
beaver	1
hat--a	1
present	1
from	1
the	1
prince--and	1
carrying	1
a	1
stick	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
did,	1
went	1
out	1
accompanied	1
by	1
his	1
family.	1
Three	1
well-fed	1
roans	1
stood	1
ready	1
harnessed	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
conveyance	1
with	1
a	1
leather	1
hood.	1
	1
The	1
larger	1
bell	1
was	1
muffled	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
bells	1
on	1
the	1
harness	1
stuffed	1
with	1
paper.	1
The	1
prince	1
allowed	1
no	1
one	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
to	1
drive	1
with	1
ringing	1
bells;	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
long	1
journey	1
Alpatych	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
them.	1
His	1
satellites--the	1
senior	1
clerk,	1
a	1
countinghouse	1
clerk,	1
a	1
scullery	1
maid,	1
a	1
cook,	1
two	1
old	1
women,	1
a	1
little	1
pageboy,	1
the	1
coachman,	1
and	1
various	1
domestic	1
serfs--were	1
seeing	1
him	1
off.	1
	1
His	1
daughter	1
placed	1
chintz-covered	1
down	1
cushions	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
and	1
behind	1
his	1
back.	1
His	1
old	1
sister-in-law	1
popped	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
bundle,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
coachmen	1
helped	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
vehicle.	1
	1
"There!	1
There!	1
Women's	1
fuss!	1
Women,	1
women!"	1
said	1
Alpatych,	1
puffing	1
and	1
speaking	1
rapidly	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
did,	1
and	1
he	1
climbed	1
into	1
the	1
trap.	1
	1
After	1
giving	1
the	1
clerk	1
orders	1
about	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
Alpatych,	1
not	1
trying	1
to	1
imitate	1
the	1
prince	1
now,	1
lifted	1
the	1
hat	1
from	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
and	1
crossed	1
himself	1
three	1
times.	1
	1
"If	1
there	1
is	1
anything...	1
come	1
back,	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych!	1
For	1
Christ's	1
sake	1
think	1
of	1
us!"	1
cried	1
his	1
wife,	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
rumors	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
"Women,	1
women!	1
Women's	1
fuss!"	1
muttered	1
Alpatych	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
started	1
on	1
his	1
journey,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
yellow	1
rye	1
and	1
the	1
still-	1
green,	1
thickly	1
growing	1
oats,	1
and	1
at	1
other	1
quite	1
black	1
fields	1
just	1
being	1
plowed	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
along	1
he	1
looked	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
year's	1
splendid	1
crop	1
of	1
corn,	1
scrutinized	1
the	1
strips	1
of	1
ryefield	1
which	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
already	1
being	1
reaped,	1
made	1
his	1
calculations	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
sowing	1
and	1
the	1
harvest,	1
and	1
asked	1
himself	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
forgotten	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
prince's	1
orders.	1
	1
Having	1
baited	1
the	1
horses	1
twice	1
on	1
the	1
way,	1
he	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
town	1
toward	1
evening	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
of	1
August.	1
	1
Alpatych	1
kept	1
meeting	1
and	1
overtaking	1
baggage	1
trains	1
and	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
road.	1
As	1
he	1
approached	1
Smolensk	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
distant	1
firing,	1
but	1
these	1
did	1
not	1
impress	1
him.	1
What	1
struck	1
him	1
most	1
was	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
splendid	1
field	1
of	1
oats	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
camp	1
had	1
been	1
pitched	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
being	1
mown	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
evidently	1
for	1
fodder.	1
This	1
fact	1
impressed	1
Alpatych,	1
but	1
in	1
thinking	1
about	1
his	1
own	1
business	1
he	1
soon	1
forgot	1
it.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
years	1
had	1
been	1
bounded	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
prince,	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
went	1
beyond	1
that	1
limit.	1
Everything	1
not	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
prince's	1
orders	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
exist	1
for	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
Smolensk	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
of	1
August	1
he	1
put	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Gachina	1
suburb	1
across	1
the	1
Dnieper,	1
at	1
the	1
inn	1
kept	1
by	1
Ferapontov,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
putting	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
thirty	1
years.	1
Some	1
thirty	1
years	1
ago	1
Ferapontov,	1
by	1
Alpatych's	1
advice,	1
had	1
bought	1
a	1
wood	1
from	1
the	1
prince,	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
trade,	1
and	1
now	1
had	1
a	1
house,	1
an	1
inn,	1
and	1
a	1
corn	1
dealer's	1
shop	1
in	1
that	1
province.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
stout,	1
dark,	1
red-	1
faced	1
peasant	1
in	1
the	1
forties,	1
with	1
thick	1
lips,	1
a	1
broad	1
knob	1
of	1
a	1
nose,	1
similar	1
knobs	1
over	1
his	1
black	1
frowning	1
brows,	1
and	1
a	1
round	1
belly.	1
	1
Wearing	1
a	1
waistcoat	1
over	1
his	1
cotton	1
shirt,	1
Ferapontov	1
was	1
standing	1
before	1
his	1
shop	1
which	1
opened	1
onto	1
the	1
street.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Alpatych	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"You're	1
welcome,	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych.	1
Folks	1
are	1
leaving	1
the	1
town,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
they	1
leaving	1
the	1
town?"	1
asked	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
"That's	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
Folks	1
are	1
foolish!	1
Always	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
French."	1
	1
"Women's	1
fuss,	1
women's	1
fuss!"	1
said	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
"Just	1
what	1
I	1
think,	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych.	1
What	1
I	1
say	1
is:	1
orders	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
in,	1
so	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
right.	1
And	1
the	1
peasants	1
are	1
asking	1
three	1
rubles	1
for	1
carting--it	1
isn't	1
Christian!"	1
	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych	1
heard	1
without	1
heeding.	1
He	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
samovar	1
and	1
for	1
hay	1
for	1
his	1
horses,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
tea	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
	1
All	1
night	1
long	1
troops	1
were	1
moving	1
past	1
the	1
inn.	1
Next	1
morning	1
Alpatych	1
donned	1
a	1
jacket	1
he	1
wore	1
only	1
in	1
town	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
business.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
sunny	1
morning	1
and	1
by	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
hot.	1
"A	1
good	1
day	1
for	1
harvesting,"	1
thought	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
From	1
beyond	1
the	1
town	1
firing	1
had	1
been	1
heard	1
since	1
early	1
morning.	1
At	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
the	1
booming	1
of	1
cannon	1
was	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
musketry.	1
Many	1
people	1
were	1
hurrying	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
soldiers,	1
but	1
cabs	1
were	1
still	1
driving	1
about,	1
tradesmen	1
stood	1
at	1
their	1
shops,	1
and	1
service	1
was	1
being	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
churches	1
as	1
usual.	1
Alpatych	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
shops,	1
to	1
government	1
offices,	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
office,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Governor's.	1
In	1
the	1
offices	1
and	1
shops	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
post	1
office	1
everyone	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
enemy	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
attacking	1
the	1
town,	1
everybody	1
was	1
asking	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
done,	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
calm	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Governor's	1
house	1
Alpatych	1
found	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
people,	1
Cossacks,	1
and	1
a	1
traveling	1
carriage	1
of	1
the	1
Governor's.	1
At	1
the	1
porch	1
he	1
met	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
landed	1
gentry,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
knew.	1
This	1
man,	1
an	1
ex-captain	1
of	1
police,	1
was	1
saying	1
angrily:	1
	1
"It's	1
no	1
joke,	1
you	1
know!	1
It's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
if	1
you're	1
single.	1
'One	1
man	1
though	1
undone	1
is	1
but	1
one,'	1
as	1
the	1
proverb	1
says,	1
but	1
with	1
thirteen	1
in	1
your	1
family	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
property...	1
They've	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
utter	1
ruin!	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
governors	1
are	1
they	1
to	1
do	1
that?	1
They	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
hanged--the	1
brigands!..."	1
	1
"Oh	1
come,	1
that's	1
enough!"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
I	1
care?	1
Let	1
him	1
hear!	1
We're	1
not	1
dogs,"	1
said	1
the	1
ex-captain	1
of	1
police,	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
he	1
noticed	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych!	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
for?"	1
	1
"To	1
see	1
the	1
Governor	1
by	1
his	1
excellency's	1
order,"	1
answered	1
Alpatych,	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
proudly	1
thrusting	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
he	1
mentioned	1
the	1
prince....	1
"He	1
has	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
inquire	1
into	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
affairs,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
go	1
and	1
find	1
out!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
angry	1
gentleman.	1
"They've	1
brought	1
things	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
carts	1
or	1
anything!...	1
There	1
it	1
is	1
again,	1
do	1
you	1
hear?"	1
said	1
he,	1
pointing	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
whence	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing.	1
	1
"They've	1
brought	1
us	1
all	1
to	1
ruin...	1
the	1
brigands!"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
and	1
descended	1
the	1
porch	1
steps.	1
	1
Alpatych	1
swayed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
went	1
upstairs.	1
In	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
were	1
tradesmen,	1
women,	1
and	1
officials,	1
looking	1
silently	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
Governor's	1
room	1
opened	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
rose	1
and	1
moved	1
forward.	1
An	1
official	1
ran	1
out,	1
said	1
some	1
words	1
to	1
a	1
merchant,	1
called	1
a	1
stout	1
official	1
with	1
a	1
cross	1
hanging	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
and	1
vanished	1
again,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
inquiring	1
looks	1
and	1
questions	1
addressed	1
to	1
him.	1
Alpatych	1
moved	1
forward	1
and	1
next	1
time	1
the	1
official	1
came	1
out	1
addressed	1
him,	1
one	1
hand	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
his	1
buttoned	1
coat,	1
and	1
handed	1
him	1
two	1
letters.	1
	1
"To	1
his	1
Honor	1
Baron	1
Asch,	1
from	1
General-in-Chief	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,"	1
he	1
announced	1
with	1
such	1
solemnity	1
and	1
significance	1
that	1
the	1
official	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
letters.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
Governor	1
received	1
Alpatych	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
	1
"Inform	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
princess	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
nothing:	1
I	1
acted	1
on	1
the	1
highest	1
instructions--here..."	1
and	1
he	1
handed	1
a	1
paper	1
to	1
Alpatych.	1
"Still,	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
is	1
unwell	1
my	1
advice	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
I	1
am	1
just	1
starting	1
myself.	1
Inform	1
them..."	1
	1
But	1
the	1
Governor	1
did	1
not	1
finish:	1
a	1
dusty	1
perspiring	1
officer	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
in	1
French.	1
The	1
Governor's	1
face	1
expressed	1
terror.	1
	1
"Go,"	1
he	1
said,	1
nodding	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
Alpatych,	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
Eager,	1
frightened,	1
helpless	1
glances	1
were	1
turned	1
on	1
Alpatych	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Governor's	1
room.	1
Involuntarily	1
listening	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
firing,	1
which	1
had	1
drawn	1
nearer	1
and	1
was	1
increasing	1
in	1
strength,	1
Alpatych	1
hurried	1
to	1
his	1
inn.	1
The	1
paper	1
handed	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
Governor	1
said	1
this:	1
	1
"I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Smolensk	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
danger	1
as	1
yet	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
unlikely	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
threatened	1
with	1
any.	1
I	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
are	1
marching	1
to	1
unite	1
our	1
forces	1
before	1
Smolensk,	1
which	1
junction	1
will	1
be	1
effected	1
on	1
the	1
22nd	1
instant,	1
and	1
both	1
armies	1
with	1
their	1
united	1
forces	1
will	1
defend	1
our	1
compatriots	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
entrusted	1
to	1
your	1
care	1
till	1
our	1
efforts	1
shall	1
have	1
beaten	1
back	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
our	1
Fatherland,	1
or	1
till	1
the	1
last	1
warrior	1
in	1
our	1
valiant	1
ranks	1
has	1
perished.	1
From	1
this	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
perfect	1
right	1
to	1
reassure	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Smolensk,	1
for	1
those	1
defended	1
by	1
two	1
such	1
brave	1
armies	1
may	1
feel	1
assured	1
of	1
victory."	1
(Instructions	1
from	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly	1
to	1
Baron	1
Asch,	1
the	1
civil	1
governor	1
of	1
Smolensk,	1
1812.)	1
	1
People	1
were	1
anxiously	1
roaming	1
about	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
Carts	1
piled	1
high	1
with	1
household	1
utensils,	1
chairs,	1
and	1
cupboards	1
kept	1
emerging	1
from	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
yards	1
and	1
moving	1
along	1
the	1
streets.	1
Loaded	1
carts	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
next	1
to	1
Ferapontov's	1
and	1
women	1
were	1
wailing	1
and	1
lamenting	1
as	1
they	1
said	1
good-by.	1
A	1
small	1
watchdog	1
ran	1
round	1
barking	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
harnessed	1
horses.	1
	1
Alpatych	1
entered	1
the	1
innyard	1
at	1
a	1
quicker	1
pace	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
shed	1
where	1
his	1
horses	1
and	1
trap	1
were.	1
The	1
coachman	1
was	1
asleep.	1
He	1
woke	1
him	1
up,	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
harness,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
passage.	1
From	1
the	1
host's	1
room	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
crying,	1
the	1
despairing	1
sobs	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
hoarse	1
angry	1
shouting	1
of	1
Ferapontov.	1
The	1
cook	1
began	1
running	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
like	1
a	1
frightened	1
hen,	1
just	1
as	1
Alpatych	1
entered.	1
	1
"He's	1
done	1
her	1
to	1
death.	1
Killed	1
the	1
mistress!...	1
Beat	1
her...	1
dragged	1
her	1
about	1
so!..."	1
	1
"What	1
for?"	1
asked	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
"She	1
kept	1
begging	1
to	1
go	1
away.	1
She's	1
a	1
woman!	1
'Take	1
me	1
away,'	1
says	1
she,	1
'don't	1
let	1
me	1
perish	1
with	1
my	1
little	1
children!	1
Folks,'	1
she	1
says,	1
'are	1
all	1
gone,	1
so	1
why,'	1
she	1
says,	1
'don't	1
we	1
go?'	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
beating	1
and	1
pulling	1
her	1
about	1
so!"	1
	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
Alpatych	1
nodded	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
approval,	1
and	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
hear	1
more	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
opposite	1
the	1
innkeeper's,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
purchases.	1
	1
"You	1
brute,	1
you	1
murderer!"	1
screamed	1
a	1
thin,	1
pale	1
woman	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
baby	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
her	1
kerchief	1
torn	1
from	1
her	1
head,	1
burst	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
into	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
Ferapontov	1
came	1
out	1
after	1
her,	1
but	1
on	1
seeing	1
Alpatych	1
adjusted	1
his	1
waistcoat,	1
smoothed	1
his	1
hair,	1
yawned,	1
and	1
followed	1
Alpatych	1
into	1
the	1
opposite	1
room.	1
	1
"Going	1
already?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Alpatych,	1
without	1
answering	1
or	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
host,	1
sorted	1
his	1
packages	1
and	1
asked	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
owed.	1
	1
"We'll	1
reckon	1
up!	1
Well,	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
Governor's?"	1
asked	1
Ferapontov.	1
"What	1
has	1
been	1
decided?"	1
	1
Alpatych	1
replied	1
that	1
the	1
Governor	1
had	1
not	1
told	1
him	1
anything	1
definite.	1
	1
"With	1
our	1
business,	1
how	1
can	1
we	1
get	1
away?"	1
said	1
Ferapontov.	1
"We'd	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
seven	1
rubles	1
a	1
cartload	1
to	1
Dorogobuzh	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
them	1
they're	1
not	1
Christians	1
to	1
ask	1
it!	1
Selivanov,	1
now,	1
did	1
a	1
good	1
stroke	1
last	1
Thursday--	1
sold	1
flour	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
at	1
nine	1
rubles	1
a	1
sack.	1
Will	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
tea?"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
being	1
harnessed	1
Alpatych	1
and	1
Ferapontov	1
over	1
their	1
tea	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
corn,	1
the	1
crops,	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
weather	1
for	1
harvesting.	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
getting	1
quieter,"	1
remarked	1
Ferapontov,	1
finishing	1
his	1
third	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
and	1
getting	1
up.	1
"Ours	1
must	1
have	1
got	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
orders	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
in.	1
So	1
we're	1
in	1
force,	1
it	1
seems....	1
They	1
say	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
Matthew	1
Ivanych	1
Platov	1
drove	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
Marina	1
and	1
drowned	1
some	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
in	1
one	1
day."	1
	1
Alpatych	1
collected	1
his	1
parcels,	1
handed	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
coachman	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in,	1
and	1
settled	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
innkeeper.	1
The	1
noise	1
of	1
wheels,	1
hoofs,	1
and	1
bells	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
gateway	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
trap	1
passed	1
out.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
by	1
now	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
Half	1
the	1
street	1
was	1
in	1
shadow,	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
brightly	1
lit	1
by	1
the	1
sun.	1
Alpatych	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
strange	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
far-off	1
whistling	1
and	1
thud	1
was	1
heard,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
boom	1
of	1
cannon	1
blending	1
into	1
a	1
dull	1
roar	1
that	1
set	1
the	1
windows	1
rattling.	1
	1
He	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street:	1
two	1
men	1
were	1
running	1
past	1
toward	1
the	1
bridge.	1
From	1
different	1
sides	1
came	1
whistling	1
sounds	1
and	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
cannon	1
balls	1
and	1
bursting	1
shells	1
falling	1
on	1
the	1
town.	1
But	1
these	1
sounds	1
were	1
hardly	1
heard	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
firing	1
outside	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
attracted	1
little	1
attention	1
from	1
the	1
inhabitants.	1
The	1
town	1
was	1
being	1
bombarded	1
by	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
guns	1
which	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
ordered	1
up	1
after	1
four	1
o'clock.	1
The	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
realize	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
bombardment.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
falling	1
bombs	1
and	1
shells	1
only	1
aroused	1
curiosity.	1
Ferapontov's	1
wife,	1
who	1
till	1
then	1
had	1
not	1
ceased	1
wailing	1
under	1
the	1
shed,	1
became	1
quiet	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
baby	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
gate,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
and	1
looking	1
in	1
silence	1
at	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
The	1
cook	1
and	1
a	1
shop	1
assistant	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
With	1
lively	1
curiosity	1
everyone	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
projectiles	1
as	1
they	1
flew	1
over	1
their	1
heads.	1
Several	1
people	1
came	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
talking	1
eagerly.	1
	1
"What	1
force!"	1
remarked	1
one.	1
"Knocked	1
the	1
roof	1
and	1
ceiling	1
all	1
to	1
splinters!"	1
	1
"Routed	1
up	1
the	1
earth	1
like	1
a	1
pig,"	1
said	1
another.	1
	1
"That's	1
grand,	1
it	1
bucks	1
one	1
up!"	1
laughed	1
the	1
first.	1
"Lucky	1
you	1
jumped	1
aside,	1
or	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
wiped	1
you	1
out!"	1
	1
Others	1
joined	1
those	1
men	1
and	1
stopped	1
and	1
told	1
how	1
cannon	1
balls	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
a	1
house	1
close	1
to	1
them.	1
Meanwhile	1
still	1
more	1
projectiles,	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
swift	1
sinister	1
whistle	1
of	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball,	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
agreeable	1
intermittent	1
whistle	1
of	1
a	1
shell,	1
flew	1
over	1
people's	1
heads	1
incessantly,	1
but	1
not	1
one	1
fell	1
close	1
by,	1
they	1
all	1
flew	1
over.	1
Alpatych	1
was	1
getting	1
into	1
his	1
trap.	1
The	1
innkeeper	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
staring	1
at?"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
cook,	1
who	1
in	1
her	1
red	1
skirt,	1
with	1
sleeves	1
rolled	1
up,	1
swinging	1
her	1
bare	1
elbows,	1
had	1
stepped	1
to	1
the	1
corner	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said.	1
	1
"What	1
marvels!"	1
she	1
exclaimed,	1
but	1
hearing	1
her	1
master's	1
voice	1
she	1
turned	1
back,	1
pulling	1
down	1
her	1
tucked-up	1
skirt.	1
	1
Once	1
more	1
something	1
whistled,	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
quite	1
close,	1
swooping	1
downwards	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
bird;	1
a	1
flame	1
flashed	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
something	1
exploded,	1
and	1
the	1
street	1
was	1
shrouded	1
in	1
smoke.	1
	1
"Scoundrel,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
innkeeper,	1
rushing	1
to	1
the	1
cook.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
pitiful	1
wailing	1
of	1
women	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
different	1
sides,	1
the	1
frightened	1
baby	1
began	1
to	1
cry,	1
and	1
people	1
crowded	1
silently	1
with	1
pale	1
faces	1
round	1
the	1
cook.	1
The	1
loudest	1
sound	1
in	1
that	1
crowd	1
was	1
her	1
wailing.	1
	1
"Oh-h-h!	1
Dear	1
souls,	1
dear	1
kind	1
souls!	1
Don't	1
let	1
me	1
die!	1
My	1
good	1
souls!..."	1
	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
no	1
one	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
The	1
cook,	1
with	1
her	1
thigh	1
broken	1
by	1
a	1
shell	1
splinter,	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
kitchen.	1
Alpatych,	1
his	1
coachman,	1
Ferapontov's	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
porter	1
were	1
all	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
cellar,	1
listening.	1
The	1
roar	1
of	1
guns,	1
the	1
whistling	1
of	1
projectiles,	1
and	1
the	1
piteous	1
moaning	1
of	1
the	1
cook,	1
which	1
rose	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
sounds,	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
The	1
mistress	1
rocked	1
and	1
hushed	1
her	1
baby	1
and	1
when	1
anyone	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
cellar	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
pathetic	1
whisper	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
A	1
shopman	1
who	1
entered	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
gone	1
with	1
others	1
to	1
the	1
cathedral,	1
whence	1
they	1
were	1
fetching	1
the	1
wonder-	1
working	1
icon	1
of	1
Smolensk.	1
	1
Toward	1
dusk	1
the	1
cannonade	1
began	1
to	1
subside.	1
Alpatych	1
left	1
the	1
cellar	1
and	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
doorway.	1
The	1
evening	1
sky	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
clear	1
was	1
clouded	1
with	1
smoke,	1
through	1
which,	1
high	1
up,	1
the	1
sickle	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
moon	1
shone	1
strangely.	1
Now	1
that	1
the	1
terrible	1
din	1
of	1
the	1
guns	1
had	1
ceased	1
a	1
hush	1
seemed	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
town,	1
broken	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
footsteps,	1
the	1
moaning,	1
the	1
distant	1
cries,	1
and	1
the	1
crackle	1
of	1
fires	1
which	1
seemed	1
widespread	1
everywhere.	1
The	1
cook's	1
moans	1
had	1
now	1
subsided.	1
On	1
two	1
sides	1
black	1
curling	1
clouds	1
of	1
smoke	1
rose	1
and	1
spread	1
from	1
the	1
fires.	1
Through	1
the	1
streets	1
soldiers	1
in	1
various	1
uniforms	1
walked	1
or	1
ran	1
confusedly	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
like	1
ants	1
from	1
a	1
ruined	1
ant-hill.	1
Several	1
of	1
them	1
ran	1
into	1
Ferapontov's	1
yard	1
before	1
Alpatych's	1
eyes.	1
Alpatych	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
A	1
retreating	1
regiment,	1
thronging	1
and	1
hurrying,	1
blocked	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
Noticing	1
him,	1
an	1
officer	1
said:	1
"The	1
town	1
is	1
being	1
abandoned.	1
Get	1
away,	1
get	1
away!"	1
and	1
then,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
shouted:	1
	1
"I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
run	1
into	1
the	1
yards!"	1
	1
Alpatych	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
called	1
the	1
coachman,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
set	1
off.	1
Ferapontov's	1
whole	1
household	1
came	1
out	1
too,	1
following	1
Alpatych	1
and	1
the	1
coachman.	1
The	1
women,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
silent	1
till	1
then,	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
wail	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fires--the	1
smoke	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
flames	1
of	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
failing	1
twilight--and	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
reply	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
lamentation	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
street.	1
Inside	1
the	1
shed	1
Alpatych	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
arranged	1
the	1
tangled	1
reins	1
and	1
traces	1
of	1
their	1
horses	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands.	1
	1
As	1
Alpatych	1
was	1
driving	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
he	1
saw	1
some	1
ten	1
soldiers	1
in	1
Ferapontov's	1
open	1
shop,	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
filling	1
their	1
bags	1
and	1
knapsacks	1
with	1
flour	1
and	1
sunflower	1
seeds.	1
Just	1
then	1
Ferapontov	1
returned	1
and	1
entered	1
his	1
shop.	1
On	1
seeing	1
the	1
soldiers	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
shout	1
at	1
them,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
and,	1
clutching	1
at	1
his	1
hair,	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs	1
and	1
laughter:	1
	1
"Loot	1
everything,	1
lads!	1
Don't	1
let	1
those	1
devils	1
get	1
it!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
taking	1
some	1
bags	1
of	1
flour	1
himself	1
and	1
throwing	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
were	1
frightened	1
and	1
ran	1
away,	1
others	1
went	1
on	1
filling	1
their	1
bags.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Alpatych,	1
Ferapontov	1
turned	1
to	1
him:	1
	1
"Russia	1
is	1
done	1
for!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Alpatych,	1
I'll	1
set	1
the	1
place	1
on	1
fire	1
myself.	1
We're	1
done	1
for!..."	1
and	1
Ferapontov	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
Soldiers	1
were	1
passing	1
in	1
a	1
constant	1
stream	1
along	1
the	1
street	1
blocking	1
it	1
completely,	1
so	1
that	1
Alpatych	1
could	1
not	1
pass	1
out	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
wait.	1
Ferapontov's	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
were	1
also	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
cart	1
waiting	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
drive	1
out.	1
	1
Night	1
had	1
come.	1
There	1
were	1
stars	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
moon	1
shone	1
out	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
that	1
screened	1
it.	1
On	1
the	1
sloping	1
descent	1
to	1
the	1
Dnieper	1
Alpatych's	1
cart	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
innkeeper's	1
wife,	1
which	1
were	1
slowly	1
moving	1
amid	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
soldiers	1
and	1
of	1
other	1
vehicles,	1
had	1
to	1
stop.	1
In	1
a	1
side	1
street	1
near	1
the	1
crossroads	1
where	1
the	1
vehicles	1
had	1
stopped,	1
a	1
house	1
and	1
some	1
shops	1
were	1
on	1
fire.	1
This	1
fire	1
was	1
already	1
burning	1
itself	1
out.	1
The	1
flames	1
now	1
died	1
down	1
and	1
were	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
smoke,	1
now	1
suddenly	1
flared	1
up	1
again	1
brightly,	1
lighting	1
up	1
with	1
strange	1
distinctness	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
crowding	1
at	1
the	1
crossroads.	1
Black	1
figures	1
flitted	1
about	1
before	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
incessant	1
crackling	1
of	1
the	1
flames	1
talking	1
and	1
shouting	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Seeing	1
that	1
his	1
trap	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
Alpatych	1
got	1
down	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
side	1
street	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
fire.	1
Soldiers	1
were	1
continually	1
rushing	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards	1
near	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
frieze	1
coat	1
dragging	1
burning	1
beams	1
into	1
another	1
yard	1
across	1
the	1
street,	1
while	1
others	1
carried	1
bundles	1
of	1
hay.	1
	1
Alpatych	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
crowd	1
standing	1
before	1
a	1
high	1
barn	1
which	1
was	1
blazing	1
briskly.	1
The	1
walls	1
were	1
all	1
on	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
back	1
wall	1
had	1
fallen	1
in,	1
the	1
wooden	1
roof	1
was	1
collapsing,	1
and	1
the	1
rafters	1
were	1
alight.	1
The	1
crowd	1
was	1
evidently	1
watching	1
for	1
the	1
roof	1
to	1
fall	1
in,	1
and	1
Alpatych	1
watched	1
for	1
it	1
too.	1
	1
"Alpatych!"	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
hailed	1
the	1
old	1
man.	1
	1
"Mercy	1
on	1
us!	1
Your	1
excellency!"	1
answered	1
Alpatych,	1
immediately	1
recognizing	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
prince.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
his	1
riding	1
cloak,	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
black	1
horse,	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
Alpatych	1
from	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Your...	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
stammered	1
Alpatych	1
and	1
broke	1
into	1
sobs.	1
"Are	1
we	1
really	1
lost?	1
Master!..."	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
here?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
repeated.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
flames	1
flared	1
up	1
and	1
showed	1
his	1
young	1
master's	1
pale	1
worn	1
face.	1
Alpatych	1
told	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
there	1
and	1
how	1
difficult	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
away.	1
	1
"Are	1
we	1
really	1
quite	1
lost,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
he	1
asked	1
again.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
without	1
replying	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
notebook	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
knee	1
began	1
writing	1
in	1
pencil	1
on	1
a	1
page	1
he	1
tore	1
out.	1
He	1
wrote	1
to	1
his	1
sister:	1
	1
"Smolensk	1
is	1
being	1
abandoned.	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
will	1
be	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
enemy	1
within	1
a	1
week.	1
Set	1
off	1
immediately	1
for	1
Moscow.	1
Let	1
me	1
know	1
at	1
once	1
when	1
you	1
will	1
start.	1
Send	1
by	1
special	1
messenger	1
to	1
Usvyazh."	1
	1
Having	1
written	1
this	1
and	1
given	1
the	1
paper	1
to	1
Alpatych,	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
for	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
prince,	1
the	1
princess,	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
boy's	1
tutor,	1
and	1
how	1
and	1
where	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
immediately.	1
Before	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
giving	1
these	1
instructions,	1
a	1
chief	1
of	1
staff	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
suite	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
colonel?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
staff	1
with	1
a	1
German	1
accent,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
familiar	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Houses	1
are	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
in	1
your	1
presence	1
and	1
you	1
stand	1
by!	1
What	1
does	1
this	1
mean?	1
You	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
it!"	1
shouted	1
Berg,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
assistant	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
infantry	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
army,	1
a	1
place,	1
as	1
Berg	1
said,	1
"very	1
agreeable	1
and	1
well	1
en	1
evidence."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
without	1
replying	1
went	1
on	1
speaking	1
to	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
"So	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
await	1
a	1
reply	1
till	1
the	1
tenth,	1
and	1
if	1
by	1
the	1
tenth	1
I	1
don't	1
receive	1
news	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
all	1
got	1
away	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
throw	1
up	1
everything	1
and	1
come	1
myself	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills."	1
	1
"Prince,"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
recognizing	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"I	1
only	1
spoke	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
obey	1
orders,	1
because	1
I	1
always	1
do	1
obey	1
exactly....	1
You	1
must	1
please	1
excuse	1
me,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
apologetically.	1
	1
Something	1
cracked	1
in	1
the	1
flames.	1
The	1
fire	1
died	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
wreaths	1
of	1
black	1
smoke	1
rolled	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
roof.	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
terrible	1
crash	1
and	1
something	1
huge	1
collapsed.	1
	1
"Ou-rou-rou!"	1
yelled	1
the	1
crowd,	1
echoing	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
collapsing	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
barn,	1
the	1
burning	1
grain	1
in	1
which	1
diffused	1
a	1
cakelike	1
aroma	1
all	1
around.	1
The	1
flames	1
flared	1
up	1
again,	1
lighting	1
the	1
animated,	1
delighted,	1
exhausted	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
spectators.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
coat	1
raised	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
shouted:	1
	1
"It's	1
fine,	1
lads!	1
Now	1
it's	1
raging...	1
It's	1
fine!"	1
	1
"That's	1
the	1
owner	1
himself,"	1
cried	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
Alpatych,	1
"report	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you";	1
and	1
not	1
replying	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Berg	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
mute	1
beside	1
him,	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
down	1
the	1
side	1
street.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
From	1
Smolensk	1
the	1
troops	1
continued	1
to	1
retreat,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
enemy.	1
On	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
August	1
the	1
regiment	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
commanded	1
was	1
marching	1
along	1
the	1
highroad	1
past	1
the	1
avenue	1
leading	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
Heat	1
and	1
drought	1
had	1
continued	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
weeks.	1
Each	1
day	1
fleecy	1
clouds	1
floated	1
across	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
occasionally	1
veiled	1
the	1
sun,	1
but	1
toward	1
evening	1
the	1
sky	1
cleared	1
again	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
set	1
in	1
reddish-brown	1
mist.	1
Heavy	1
night	1
dews	1
alone	1
refreshed	1
the	1
earth.	1
The	1
unreaped	1
corn	1
was	1
scorched	1
and	1
shed	1
its	1
grain.	1
The	1
marshes	1
dried	1
up.	1
The	1
cattle	1
lowed	1
from	1
hunger,	1
finding	1
no	1
food	1
on	1
the	1
sun-parched	1
meadows.	1
Only	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
forests	1
while	1
the	1
dew	1
lasted	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
freshness.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
the	1
highroad	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
marched,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
freshness	1
even	1
at	1
night	1
or	1
when	1
the	1
road	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
forest;	1
the	1
dew	1
was	1
imperceptible	1
on	1
the	1
sandy	1
dust	1
churned	1
up	1
more	1
than	1
six	1
inches	1
deep.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
day	1
dawned	1
the	1
march	1
began.	1
The	1
artillery	1
and	1
baggage	1
wagons	1
moved	1
noiselessly	1
through	1
the	1
deep	1
dust	1
that	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
hubs	1
of	1
the	1
wheels,	1
and	1
the	1
infantry	1
sank	1
ankle-deep	1
in	1
that	1
soft,	1
choking,	1
hot	1
dust	1
that	1
never	1
cooled	1
even	1
at	1
night.	1
Some	1
of	1
this	1
dust	1
was	1
kneaded	1
by	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
wheels,	1
while	1
the	1
rest	1
rose	1
and	1
hung	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
over	1
the	1
troops,	1
settling	1
in	1
eyes,	1
ears,	1
hair,	1
and	1
nostrils,	1
and	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
lungs	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
beasts	1
as	1
they	1
moved	1
along	1
that	1
road.	1
The	1
higher	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
the	1
higher	1
rose	1
that	1
cloud	1
of	1
dust,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
screen	1
of	1
its	1
hot	1
fine	1
particles	1
one	1
could	1
look	1
with	1
naked	1
eye	1
at	1
the	1
sun,	1
which	1
showed	1
like	1
a	1
huge	1
crimson	1
ball	1
in	1
the	1
unclouded	1
sky.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
wind,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
choked	1
in	1
that	1
motionless	1
atmosphere.	1
They	1
marched	1
with	1
handkerchiefs	1
tied	1
over	1
their	1
noses	1
and	1
mouths.	1
When	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
a	1
village	1
they	1
all	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
wells	1
and	1
fought	1
for	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
drank	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
mud.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
regiment,	1
and	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
that	1
regiment,	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
receiving	1
and	1
giving	1
orders,	1
engrossed	1
him.	1
The	1
burning	1
of	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
its	1
abandonment	1
made	1
an	1
epoch	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
A	1
novel	1
feeling	1
of	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
foe	1
made	1
him	1
forget	1
his	1
own	1
sorrow.	1
He	1
was	1
entirely	1
devoted	1
to	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
was	1
considerate	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
his	1
men	1
and	1
officers.	1
In	1
the	1
regiment	1
they	1
called	1
him	1
"our	1
prince,"	1
were	1
proud	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
loved	1
him.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
kind	1
and	1
gentle	1
only	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
regiment,	1
to	1
Timokhin	1
and	1
the	1
like--people	1
quite	1
new	1
to	1
him,	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
different	1
world	1
and	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
understand	1
his	1
past.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
across	1
a	1
former	1
acquaintance	1
or	1
anyone	1
from	1
the	1
staff,	1
he	1
bristled	1
up	1
immediately	1
and	1
grew	1
spiteful,	1
ironical,	1
and	1
contemptuous.	1
Everything	1
that	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
past	1
was	1
repugnant	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
that	1
former	1
circle	1
he	1
confined	1
himself	1
to	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
duty	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
unfair.	1
	1
In	1
truth	1
everything	1
presented	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
and	1
gloomy	1
light	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
especially	1
after	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Smolensk	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
of	1
August	1
(he	1
considered	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
defended)	1
and	1
after	1
his	1
sick	1
father	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
flee	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
abandoning	1
to	1
pillage	1
his	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
built	1
and	1
peopled.	1
But	1
despite	1
this,	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
regiment,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
entirely	1
apart	1
from	1
general	1
questions.	1
Two	1
days	1
previously	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
news	1
that	1
his	1
father,	1
son,	1
and	1
sister	1
had	1
left	1
for	1
Moscow;	1
and	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
characteristic	1
desire	1
to	1
foment	1
his	1
own	1
grief	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
ride	1
there.	1
	1
He	1
ordered	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
be	1
saddled	1
and,	1
leaving	1
his	1
regiment	1
on	1
the	1
march,	1
rode	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
estate	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
and	1
spent	1
his	1
childhood.	1
Riding	1
past	1
the	1
pond	1
where	1
there	1
used	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
dozens	1
of	1
women	1
chattering	1
as	1
they	1
rinsed	1
their	1
linen	1
or	1
beat	1
it	1
with	1
wooden	1
beetles,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
noticed	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
about	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
washing	1
wharf,	1
torn	1
from	1
its	1
place	1
and	1
half	1
submerged,	1
was	1
floating	1
on	1
its	1
side	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
pond.	1
He	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
keeper's	1
lodge.	1
No	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
stone	1
entrance	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
drive	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
stood	1
open.	1
Grass	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
grow	1
on	1
the	1
garden	1
paths,	1
and	1
horses	1
and	1
calves	1
were	1
straying	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
park.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
hothouse;	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
glass	1
panes	1
were	1
broken,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
in	1
tubs	1
some	1
were	1
overturned	1
and	1
others	1
dried	1
up.	1
He	1
called	1
for	1
Taras	1
the	1
gardener,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
replied.	1
Having	1
gone	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
hothouse	1
to	1
the	1
ornamental	1
garden,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
carved	1
garden	1
fence	1
was	1
broken	1
and	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
plum	1
trees	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
fruit.	1
An	1
old	1
peasant	1
whom	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
his	1
childhood	1
had	1
often	1
seen	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
green	1
garden	1
seat,	1
plaiting	1
a	1
bast	1
shoe.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
deaf	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
ride	1
up.	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
used	1
to	1
like	1
to	1
sit	1
on,	1
and	1
beside	1
him	1
strips	1
of	1
bast	1
were	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
broken	1
and	1
withered	1
branch	1
of	1
a	1
magnolia.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
Several	1
limes	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
garden	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
down	1
and	1
a	1
piebald	1
mare	1
and	1
her	1
foal	1
were	1
wandering	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
among	1
the	1
rosebushes.	1
The	1
shutters	1
were	1
all	1
closed,	1
except	1
at	1
one	1
window	1
which	1
was	1
open.	1
A	1
little	1
serf	1
boy,	1
seeing	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
Alpatych,	1
having	1
sent	1
his	1
family	1
away,	1
was	1
alone	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
and	1
was	1
sitting	1
indoors	1
reading	1
the	1
Lives	1
of	1
the	1
Saints.	1
On	1
hearing	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
come,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
spectacles	1
on	1
his	1
nose,	1
buttoning	1
his	1
coat,	1
and,	1
hastily	1
stepping	1
up,	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
began	1
weeping	1
and	1
kissing	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
knee.	1
	1
Then,	1
vexed	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
weakness,	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
report	1
on	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
affairs.	1
Everything	1
precious	1
and	1
valuable	1
had	1
been	1
removed	1
to	1
Bogucharovo.	1
Seventy	1
quarters	1
of	1
grain	1
had	1
also	1
been	1
carted	1
away.	1
The	1
hay	1
and	1
the	1
spring	1
corn,	1
of	1
which	1
Alpatych	1
said	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
remarkable	1
crop	1
that	1
year,	1
had	1
been	1
commandeered	1
by	1
the	1
troops	1
and	1
mown	1
down	1
while	1
still	1
green.	1
The	1
peasants	1
were	1
ruined;	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
too	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Bogucharovo,	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
remained.	1
	1
Without	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
out,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked:	1
	1
"When	1
did	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
sister	1
leave?"	1
meaning	1
when	1
did	1
they	1
leave	1
for	1
Moscow.	1
	1
Alpatych,	1
understanding	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
refer	1
to	1
their	1
departure	1
for	1
Bogucharovo,	1
replied	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
and	1
again	1
went	1
into	1
details	1
concerning	1
the	1
estate	1
management,	1
asking	1
for	1
instructions.	1
	1
"Am	1
I	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
troops	1
have	1
the	1
oats,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
receipt	1
for	1
them?	1
We	1
have	1
still	1
six	1
hundred	1
quarters	1
left,"	1
he	1
inquired.	1
	1
"What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
looking	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
bald	1
head	1
shining	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
seeing	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
himself	1
understood	1
how	1
untimely	1
such	1
questions	1
were	1
and	1
only	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
allay	1
his	1
grief.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
let	1
them	1
have	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
noticed	1
some	1
disorder	1
in	1
the	1
garden,"	1
said	1
Alpatych,	1
"it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
prevent	1
it.	1
Three	1
regiments	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
night,	1
dragoons	1
mostly.	1
I	1
took	1
down	1
the	1
name	1
and	1
rank	1
of	1
their	1
commanding	1
officer,	1
to	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
complaint	1
about	1
it."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do?	1
Will	1
you	1
stay	1
here	1
if	1
the	1
enemy	1
occupies	1
the	1
place?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Alpatych	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
with	1
a	1
solemn	1
gesture	1
raised	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
my	1
refuge!	1
His	1
will	1
be	1
done!"	1
he	1
exclaimed.	1
	1
A	1
group	1
of	1
bareheaded	1
peasants	1
was	1
approaching	1
across	1
the	1
meadow	1
toward	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"Well,	1
good-by!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
bending	1
over	1
to	1
Alpatych.	1
"You	1
must	1
go	1
away	1
too,	1
take	1
away	1
what	1
you	1
can	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
serfs	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
estate	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
near	1
Moscow."	1
	1
Alpatych	1
clung	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
leg	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs.	1
Gently	1
disengaging	1
himself,	1
the	1
prince	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
down	1
the	1
avenue	1
at	1
a	1
gallop.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
still	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
ornamental	1
garden,	1
like	1
a	1
fly	1
impassive	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
loved	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
dead,	1
tapping	1
the	1
last	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
the	1
bast	1
shoe,	1
and	1
two	1
little	1
girls,	1
running	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
hot	1
house	1
carrying	1
in	1
their	1
skirts	1
plums	1
they	1
had	1
plucked	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
there,	1
came	1
upon	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
On	1
seeing	1
the	1
young	1
master,	1
the	1
elder	1
one	1
with	1
frightened	1
look	1
clutched	1
her	1
younger	1
companion	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
hid	1
with	1
her	1
behind	1
a	1
birch	1
tree,	1
not	1
stopping	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
some	1
green	1
plums	1
they	1
had	1
dropped.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
startled	1
haste,	1
unwilling	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
observed.	1
He	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
pretty	1
frightened	1
little	1
girl,	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
yet	1
felt	1
an	1
irresistible	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
A	1
new	1
sensation	1
of	1
comfort	1
and	1
relief	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
when,	1
seeing	1
these	1
girls,	1
he	1
realized	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
other	1
human	1
interests	1
entirely	1
aloof	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
legitimate	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
occupied	1
him.	1
Evidently	1
these	1
girls	1
passionately	1
desired	1
one	1
thing-	1
-to	1
carry	1
away	1
and	1
eat	1
those	1
green	1
plums	1
without	1
being	1
caught--and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shared	1
their	1
wish	1
for	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
their	1
enterprise.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
once	1
more.	1
Believing	1
their	1
danger	1
past,	1
they	1
sprang	1
from	1
their	1
ambush	1
and,	1
chirruping	1
something	1
in	1
their	1
shrill	1
little	1
voices	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
their	1
skirts,	1
their	1
bare	1
little	1
sunburned	1
feet	1
scampered	1
merrily	1
and	1
quickly	1
across	1
the	1
meadow	1
grass.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
somewhat	1
refreshed	1
by	1
having	1
ridden	1
off	1
the	1
dusty	1
highroad	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
moving.	1
But	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
he	1
again	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
overtook	1
his	1
regiment	1
at	1
its	1
halting	1
place	1
by	1
the	1
dam	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
pond.	1
It	1
was	1
past	1
one	1
o'clock.	1
The	1
sun,	1
a	1
red	1
ball	1
through	1
the	1
dust,	1
burned	1
and	1
scorched	1
his	1
back	1
intolerably	1
through	1
his	1
black	1
coat.	1
The	1
dust	1
always	1
hung	1
motionless	1
above	1
the	1
buzz	1
of	1
talk	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
resting	1
troops.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
wind.	1
As	1
he	1
crossed	1
the	1
dam	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smelled	1
the	1
ooze	1
and	1
freshness	1
of	1
the	1
pond.	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
that	1
water,	1
however	1
dirty	1
it	1
might	1
be,	1
and	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
pool	1
from	1
whence	1
came	1
sounds	1
of	1
shrieks	1
and	1
laughter.	1
The	1
small,	1
muddy,	1
green	1
pond	1
had	1
risen	1
visibly	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
foot,	1
flooding	1
the	1
dam,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
naked	1
white	1
bodies	1
of	1
soldiers	1
with	1
brick-red	1
hands,	1
necks,	1
and	1
faces,	1
who	1
were	1
splashing	1
about	1
in	1
it.	1
All	1
this	1
naked	1
white	1
human	1
flesh,	1
laughing	1
and	1
shrieking,	1
floundered	1
about	1
in	1
that	1
dirty	1
pool	1
like	1
carp	1
stuffed	1
into	1
a	1
watering	1
can,	1
and	1
the	1
suggestion	1
of	1
merriment	1
in	1
that	1
floundering	1
mass	1
rendered	1
it	1
specially	1
pathetic.	1
	1
One	1
fair-haired	1
young	1
soldier	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company,	1
whom	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
knew	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
strap	1
round	1
the	1
calf	1
of	1
one	1
leg,	1
crossed	1
himself,	1
stepped	1
back	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
run,	1
and	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
water;	1
another,	1
a	1
dark	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
shaggy,	1
stood	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
waist	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
joyfully	1
wriggling	1
his	1
muscular	1
figure	1
and	1
snorted	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
as	1
he	1
poured	1
the	1
water	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
hands	1
blackened	1
to	1
the	1
wrists.	1
There	1
were	1
sounds	1
of	1
men	1
slapping	1
one	1
another,	1
yelling,	1
and	1
puffing.	1
	1
Everywhere	1
on	1
the	1
bank,	1
on	1
the	1
dam,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
pond,	1
there	1
was	1
healthy,	1
white,	1
muscular	1
flesh.	1
The	1
officer,	1
Timokhin,	1
with	1
his	1
red	1
little	1
nose,	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
dam	1
wiping	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
towel,	1
felt	1
confused	1
at	1
seeing	1
the	1
prince,	1
but	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
address	1
him	1
nevertheless.	1
	1
"It's	1
very	1
nice,	1
your	1
excellency!	1
Wouldn't	1
you	1
like	1
to?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"It's	1
dirty,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
making	1
a	1
grimace.	1
	1
"We'll	1
clear	1
it	1
out	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
minute,"	1
said	1
Timokhin,	1
and,	1
still	1
undressed,	1
ran	1
off	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pond.	1
	1
"The	1
prince	1
wants	1
to	1
bathe."	1
	1
"What	1
prince?	1
Ours?"	1
said	1
many	1
voices,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
haste	1
to	1
clear	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
could	1
hardly	1
stop	1
them.	1
He	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
rather	1
wash	1
himself	1
with	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
barn.	1
	1
"Flesh,	1
bodies,	1
cannon	1
fodder!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
naked	1
body	1
and	1
shuddered,	1
not	1
from	1
cold	1
but	1
from	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
disgust	1
and	1
horror	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
understand,	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
bodies	1
splashing	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
dirty	1
pond.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
seventh	1
of	1
August	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
wrote	1
as	1
follows	1
from	1
his	1
quarters	1
at	1
Mikhaylovna	1
on	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road:	1
	1
Dear	1
Count	1
Alexis	1
Andreevich--(He	1
was	1
writing	1
to	1
Arakcheev	1
but	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
letter	1
would	1
be	1
read	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
therefore	1
weighed	1
every	1
word	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
ability.)	1
	1
I	1
expect	1
the	1
Minister	1
(Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly)	1
has	1
already	1
reported	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Smolensk	1
to	1
the	1
enemy.	1
It	1
is	1
pitiable	1
and	1
sad,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
is	1
in	1
despair	1
that	1
this	1
most	1
important	1
place	1
has	1
been	1
wantonly	1
abandoned.	1
I,	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
begged	1
him	1
personally	1
most	1
urgently	1
and	1
finally	1
wrote	1
him,	1
but	1
nothing	1
would	1
induce	1
him	1
to	1
consent.	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
on	1
my	1
honor	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
fix	1
as	1
never	1
before	1
and	1
might	1
have	1
lost	1
half	1
his	1
army	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
taken	1
Smolensk.	1
Our	1
troops	1
fought,	1
and	1
are	1
fighting,	1
as	1
never	1
before.	1
With	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
men	1
I	1
held	1
the	1
enemy	1
at	1
bay	1
for	1
thirty-five	1
hours	1
and	1
beat	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hold	1
out	1
even	1
for	1
fourteen	1
hours.	1
It	1
is	1
disgraceful,	1
a	1
stain	1
on	1
our	1
army,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
ought,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
not	1
to	1
live.	1
If	1
he	1
reports	1
that	1
our	1
losses	1
were	1
great,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
true;	1
perhaps	1
about	1
four	1
thousand,	1
not	1
more,	1
and	1
not	1
even	1
that;	1
but	1
even	1
were	1
they	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
that's	1
war!	1
But	1
the	1
enemy	1
has	1
lost	1
masses...	1
	1
What	1
would	1
it	1
have	1
cost	1
him	1
to	1
hold	1
out	1
for	1
another	1
two	1
days?	1
They	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
retire	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
water	1
for	1
men	1
or	1
horses.	1
He	1
gave	1
me	1
his	1
word	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
retreat,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
sent	1
instructions	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
retiring	1
that	1
night.	1
We	1
cannot	1
fight	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
or	1
we	1
may	1
soon	1
bring	1
the	1
enemy	1
to	1
Moscow...	1
	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
rumor	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
thinking	1
of	1
peace.	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
make	1
peace	1
after	1
all	1
our	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
such	1
insane	1
retreats!	1
You	1
would	1
set	1
all	1
Russia	1
against	1
you	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
would	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
to	1
wear	1
the	1
uniform.	1
If	1
it	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
this--we	1
must	1
fight	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
Russia	1
can	1
and	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
men	1
able	1
to	1
stand...	1
	1
One	1
man	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
command,	1
and	1
not	1
two.	1
Your	1
Minister	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
good	1
as	1
a	1
Minister,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
bad	1
but	1
execrable,	1
yet	1
to	1
him	1
is	1
entrusted	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
our	1
whole	1
country....	1
I	1
am	1
really	1
frantic	1
with	1
vexation;	1
forgive	1
my	1
writing	1
boldly.	1
It	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
advocates	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
a	1
peace,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Minister	1
should	1
command	1
the	1
army,	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
our	1
sovereign	1
and	1
desires	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
us	1
all.	1
So	1
I	1
write	1
you	1
frankly:	1
call	1
out	1
the	1
militia.	1
For	1
the	1
Minister	1
is	1
leading	1
these	1
visitors	1
after	1
him	1
to	1
Moscow	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
masterly	1
way.	1
The	1
whole	1
army	1
feels	1
great	1
suspicion	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
aide-de-camp	1
Wolzogen.	1
He	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
Napoleon's	1
man	1
than	1
ours,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
advising	1
the	1
Minister.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
merely	1
civil	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
obey	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
corporal,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
his	1
senior.	1
This	1
is	1
painful,	1
but,	1
loving	1
my	1
benefactor	1
and	1
sovereign,	1
I	1
submit.	1
Only	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
that	1
he	1
entrusts	1
our	1
fine	1
army	1
to	1
such	1
as	1
he.	1
Consider	1
that	1
on	1
our	1
retreat	1
we	1
have	1
lost	1
by	1
fatigue	1
and	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
more	1
than	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
had	1
we	1

Tell	1

what	1
will	1
Russia,	1
our	1
mother	1
Russia,	1
say	1
to	1
our	1
being	1

why	1
are	1
we	1
abandoning	1
our	1
good	1

What	1

I	1

vacillating,	1
a	1
coward,	1
dense,	1
dilatory,	1
and	1
has	1
all	1
bad	1
qualities.	1
The	1
whole	1

bewails	1
it	1
and	1
calls	1
down	1
curses	1
upon	1
him...	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
innumerable	1
categories	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
human	1
life	1
one	1
may	1
discriminate	1
between	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
substance	1
prevails	1
and	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
form	1
prevails.	1
To	1
the	1
latter--as	1
distinguished	1
from	1
village,	1
country,	1
provincial,	1
or	1
even	1
Moscow	1
life--we	1
may	1
allot	1
Petersburg	1
life,	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
its	1
salons.	1
That	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
salons	1
is	1
unchanging.	1
Since	1
the	1
year	1
1805	1
we	1
had	1
made	1
peace	1
and	1
had	1
again	1
quarreled	1
with	1
Bonaparte	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
constitutions	1
and	1
unmade	1
them	1
again,	1
but	1
the	1
salons	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
and	1
Helene	1
remained	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been--the	1
one	1
seven	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
five	1
years	1
before.	1
At	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
they	1
talked	1
with	1
perplexity	1
of	1
Bonaparte's	1
successes	1
just	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
subservience	1
shown	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
European	1
sovereigns	1
a	1
malicious	1
conspiracy,	1
the	1
sole	1
object	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
cause	1
unpleasantness	1
and	1
anxiety	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
circle	1
of	1
which	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
was	1
the	1
representative.	1
And	1
in	1
Helene's	1
salon,	1
which	1
Rumyantsev	1
himself	1
honored	1
with	1
his	1
visits,	1
regarding	1
Helene	1
as	1
a	1
remarkably	1
intelligent	1
woman,	1
they	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
ecstasy	1
in	1
1812	1
as	1
in	1
1808	1
of	1
the	1
"great	1
nation"	1
and	1
the	1
"great	1
man,"	1
and	1
regretted	1
our	1
rupture	1
with	1
France,	1
a	1
rupture	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
them,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
promptly	1
terminated	1
by	1
peace.	1
	1
Of	1
late,	1
since	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
army,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
excitement	1
in	1
these	1
conflicting	1
salon	1
circles	1
and	1
some	1
demonstrations	1
of	1
hostility	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
but	1
each	1
camp	1
retained	1
its	1
own	1
tendency.	1
In	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
circle	1
only	1
those	1
Frenchmen	1
were	1
admitted	1
who	1
were	1
deep-	1
rooted	1
legitimists,	1
and	1
patriotic	1
views	1
were	1
expressed	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
one	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
theater	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
French	1
troupe	1
was	1
costing	1
the	1
government	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
army	1
corps.	1
The	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
eagerly	1
followed,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
reports	1
most	1
flattering	1
to	1
our	1
army	1
were	1
circulated.	1
In	1
the	1
French	1
circle	1
of	1
Helene	1
and	1
Rumyantsev	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
were	1
contradicted	1
and	1
all	1
Napoleon's	1
attempts	1
at	1
conciliation	1
were	1
discussed.	1
In	1
that	1
circle	1
they	1
discountenanced	1
those	1
who	1
advised	1
hurried	1
preparations	1
for	1
a	1
removal	1
to	1
Kazan	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
and	1
the	1
girls'	1
educational	1
establishments	1
under	1
the	1
patronage	1
of	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress.	1
In	1
Helene's	1
circle	1
the	1
war	1
in	1
general	1
was	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
formal	1
demonstrations	1
which	1
would	1
very	1
soon	1
end	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
the	1
view	1
prevailed	1
expressed	1
by	1
Bilibin--who	1
now	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
was	1
quite	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
Helene's	1
house,	1
which	1
every	1
clever	1
man	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
visit--that	1
not	1
by	1
gunpowder	1
but	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
invented	1
it	1
would	1
matters	1
be	1
settled.	1
In	1
that	1
circle	1
the	1
Moscow	1
enthusiasm--news	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
reached	1
Petersburg	1
simultaneously	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
return--was	1
ridiculed	1
sarcastically	1
and	1
very	1
cleverly,	1
though	1
with	1
much	1
caution.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
circle	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
enraptured	1
by	1
this	1
enthusiasm	1
and	1
spoke	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
Plutarch	1
speaks	1
of	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
ancients.	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
still	1
occupied	1
his	1
former	1
important	1
posts,	1
formed	1
a	1
connecting	1
link	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
circles.	1
He	1
visited	1
his	1
"good	1
friend	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna"	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
daughter's	1
"diplomatic	1
salon,"	1
and	1
often	1
in	1
his	1
constant	1
comings	1
and	1
goings	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
camps	1
became	1
confused	1
and	1
said	1
at	1
Helene's	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
said	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
and	1
vice	1
versa.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
return	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
a	1
conversation	1
about	1
the	1
war	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
severely	1
condemned	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly,	1
but	1
was	1
undecided	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
commander-in-chief.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
visitors,	1
usually	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
"a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
merit,"	1
having	1
described	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
seen	1
Kutuzov,	1
the	1
newly	1
chosen	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
militia,	1
presiding	1
over	1
the	1
enrollment	1
of	1
recruits	1
at	1
the	1
Treasury,	1
cautiously	1
ventured	1
to	1
suggest	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
satisfy	1
all	1
requirements.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
remarked	1
with	1
a	1
melancholy	1
smile	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
done	1
nothing	1
but	1
cause	1
the	1
Emperor	1
annoyance.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
talked	1
and	1
talked	1
at	1
the	1
Assembly	1
of	1
the	1
Nobility,"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
interrupted,	1
"but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
told	1
them	1
his	1
election	1
as	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
would	1
not	1
please	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
this	1
mania	1
for	1
opposition,"	1
he	1
went	1
on.	1
"And	1
who	1
for?	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
because	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
ape	1
the	1
foolish	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
those	1
Muscovites,"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
continued,	1
forgetting	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
though	1
at	1
Helene's	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
ridicule	1
the	1
Moscow	1
enthusiasm,	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
ecstatic	1
about	1
it.	1
But	1
he	1
retrieved	1
his	1
mistake	1
at	1
once.	1
"Now,	1
is	1
it	1
suitable	1
that	1
Count	1
Kutuzov,	1
the	1
oldest	1
general	1
in	1
Russia,	1
should	1
preside	1
at	1
that	1
tribunal?	1
He	1
will	1
get	1
nothing	1
for	1
his	1
pains!	1
How	1
could	1
they	1
make	1
a	1
man	1
commander-in-chief	1
who	1
cannot	1
mount	1
a	1
horse,	1
who	1
drops	1
asleep	1
at	1
a	1
council,	1
and	1
has	1
the	1
very	1
worst	1
morals!	1
A	1
good	1
reputation	1
he	1
made	1
for	1
himself	1
at	1
Bucharest!	1
I	1
don't	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
capacity	1
as	1
a	1
general,	1
but	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
like	1
this	1
how	1
they	1
appoint	1
a	1
decrepit,	1
blind	1
old	1
man,	1
positively	1
blind?	1
A	1
fine	1
idea	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
blind	1
general!	1
He	1
can't	1
see	1
anything.	1
To	1
play	1
blindman's	1
bluff?	1
He	1
can't	1
see	1
at	1
all!"	1
	1
No	1
one	1
replied	1
to	1
his	1
remarks.	1
	1
This	1
was	1
quite	1
correct	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fourth	1
of	1
July.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-	1
ninth	1
of	1
July	1
Kutuzov	1
received	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
Prince.	1
This	1
might	1
indicate	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
therefore	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
opinion	1
continued	1
to	1
be	1
correct	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
now	1
in	1
any	1
hurry	1
to	1
express	1
it.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
of	1
August	1
a	1
committee,	1
consisting	1
of	1
Field	1
Marshal	1
Saltykov,	1
Arakcheev,	1
Vyazmitinov,	1
Lopukhin,	1
and	1
Kochubey	1
met	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
war.	1
This	1
committee	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
our	1
failures	1
were	1
due	1
to	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
unity	1
in	1
the	1
command	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
were	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
dislike	1
of	1
Kutuzov,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
deliberation	1
they	1
agreed	1
to	1
advise	1
his	1
appointment	1
as	1
commander	1
in	1
chief.	1
That	1
same	1
day	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
appointed	1
commander-in-	1
chief	1
with	1
full	1
powers	1
over	1
the	1
armies	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
region	1
occupied	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
ninth	1
of	1
August	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
again	1
met	1
the	1
"man	1
of	1
great	1
merit."	1
The	1
latter	1
was	1
very	1
attentive	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
because	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
director	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
educational	1
establishments	1
for	1
young	1
ladies.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
happy	1
conqueror	1
who	1
has	1
attained	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
desires.	1
	1
"Well,	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
the	1
great	1
news?	1
Prince	1
Kutuzov	1
is	1
field	1
marshal!	1
All	1
dissensions	1
are	1
at	1
an	1
end!	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
glad,	1
so	1
delighted!	1
At	1
last	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
man!"	1
said	1
he,	1
glancing	1
sternly	1
and	1
significantly	1
round	1
at	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
"man	1
of	1
great	1
merit,"	1
despite	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
director,	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
reminding	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
opinion.	1
Though	1
this	1
was	1
impolite	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
herself	1
who	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
news	1
with	1
delight,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
the	1
temptation.	1
	1
"But,	1
Prince,	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
blind!"	1
said	1
he,	1
reminding	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
words.	1
	1
"Eh?	1
Nonsense!	1
He	1
sees	1
well	1
enough,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
rapidly,	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
voice	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
cough--the	1
voice	1
and	1
cough	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
dispose	1
of	1
all	1
difficulties.	1
	1
"He	1
sees	1
well	1
enough,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"And	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
pleased	1
about,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
"is	1
that	1
our	1
sovereign	1
has	1
given	1
him	1
full	1
powers	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
armies	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
region--powers	1
no	1
commander-in-chief	1
ever	1
had	1
before.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
second	1
autocrat,"	1
he	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
victorious	1
smile.	1
	1
"God	1
grant	1
it!	1
God	1
grant	1
it!"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
The	1
"man	1
of	1
great	1
merit,"	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
novice	1
in	1
court	1
circles,	1
wishing	1
to	1
flatter	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
by	1
defending	1
her	1
former	1
position	1
on	1
this	1
question,	1
observed:	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
reluctant	1
to	1
give	1
Kutuzov	1
those	1
powers.	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
blushed	1
like	1
a	1
girl	1
to	1
whom	1
Joconde	1
is	1
read,	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Kutuzov:	1
'Your	1
Emperor	1
and	1
the	1
Fatherland	1
award	1
you	1
this	1
honor.'"	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
the	1
heart	1
took	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
that	1
speech,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
no!"	1
warmly	1
rejoined	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
now	1
yield	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
anyone;	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
admirable	1
himself,	1
but	1
was	1
adored	1
by	1
everybody.	1
"No,	1
that's	1
impossible,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"for	1
our	1
sovereign	1
appreciated	1
him	1
so	1
highly	1
before."	1
	1
"God	1
grant	1
only	1
that	1
Prince	1
Kutuzov	1
assumes	1
real	1
power	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
allow	1
anyone	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
spoke	1
in	1
his	1
wheel,"	1
observed	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
Understanding	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
alluded,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
for	1
a	1
fact	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
made	1
it	1
an	1
absolute	1
condition	1
that	1
the	1
Tsarevich	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
army.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor?"	1
	1
And	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
repeated	1
the	1
words	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
"I	1
can	1
neither	1
punish	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
wrong	1
nor	1
reward	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
right."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
a	1
very	1
wise	1
man	1
is	1
Prince	1
Kutuzov!	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
a	1
long	1
time!"	1
	1
"They	1
even	1
say,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
"man	1
of	1
great	1
merit"	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
possess	1
courtly	1
tact,	1
"that	1
his	1
excellency	1
made	1
it	1
an	1
express	1
condition	1
that	1
the	1
sovereign	1
himself	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
army."	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
both	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
glanced	1
sadly	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
at	1
his	1
naivete.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
While	1
this	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
already	1
passed	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
were	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
Napoleon's	1
historian	1
Thiers,	1
like	1
other	1
of	1
his	1
historians,	1
trying	1
to	1
justify	1
his	1
hero	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
drawn	1
to	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Moscow	1
against	1
his	1
will.	1
He	1
is	1
as	1
right	1
as	1
other	1
historians	1
who	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
historic	1
events	1
in	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
man;	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
right	1
as	1
the	1
Russian	1
historians	1
who	1
maintain	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
drawn	1
to	1
Moscow	1
by	1
the	1
skill	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders.	1
Here	1
besides	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
retrospection,	1
which	1
regards	1
all	1
the	1
past	1
as	1
a	1
preparation	1
for	1
events	1
that	1
subsequently	1
occur,	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
reciprocity	1
comes	1
in,	1
confusing	1
the	1
whole	1
matter.	1
A	1
good	1
chessplayer	1
having	1
lost	1
a	1
game	1
is	1
sincerely	1
convinced	1
that	1
his	1
loss	1
resulted	1
from	1
a	1
mistake	1
he	1
made	1
and	1
looks	1
for	1
that	1
mistake	1
in	1
the	1
opening,	1
but	1
forgets	1
that	1
at	1
each	1
stage	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
there	1
were	1
similar	1
mistakes	1
and	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
moves	1
were	1
perfect.	1
He	1
only	1
notices	1
the	1
mistake	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
pays	1
attention,	1
because	1
his	1
opponent	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
it.	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
complex	1
than	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
game	1
of	1
war,	1
which	1
occurs	1
under	1
certain	1
limits	1
of	1
time,	1
and	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
will	1
that	1
manipulates	1
lifeless	1
objects,	1
but	1
everything	1
results	1
from	1
innumerable	1
conflicts	1
of	1
various	1
wills!	1
	1
After	1
Smolensk	1
Napoleon	1
sought	1
a	1
battle	1
beyond	1
Dorogobuzh	1
at	1
Vyazma,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
Tsarevo-Zaymishche,	1
but	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
owing	1
to	1
a	1
conjunction	1
of	1
innumerable	1
circumstances	1
the	1
Russians	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
battle	1
till	1
they	1
reached	1
Borodino,	1
seventy	1
miles	1
from	1
Moscow.	1
From	1
Vyazma	1
Napoleon	1
ordered	1
a	1
direct	1
advance	1
on	1
Moscow.	1
	1
Moscou,	1
la	1
capitale	1
asiatique	1
de	1
ce	1
grand	1
empire,	1
la	1
ville	1
sacree	1
des	1
peuples	1
d'Alexandre,	1
Moscou	1
avec	1
ses	1
innombrables	1
eglises	1
en	1
forme	1
de	1
pagodes	1
chinoises,	1
*	1
this	1
Moscow	1
gave	1
Napoleon's	1
imagination	1
no	1
rest.	1
On	1
the	1
march	1
from	1
Vyazma	1
to	1
Tsarevo-Zaymishche	1
he	1
rode	1
his	1
light	1
bay	1
bobtailed	1
ambler	1
accompanied	1
by	1
his	1
Guards,	1
his	1
bodyguard,	1
his	1
pages,	1
and	1
aides-de-camp.	1
Berthier,	1
his	1
chief	1
of	1
staff,	1
dropped	1
behind	1
to	1
question	1
a	1
Russian	1
prisoner	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
cavalry.	1
Followed	1
by	1
Lelorgne	1
d'Ideville,	1
an	1
interpreter,	1
he	1
overtook	1
Napoleon	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
and	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
an	1
amused	1
expression.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Moscow,	1
the	1
Asiatic	1
capital	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
empire,	1
the	1
sacred	1
city	1
of	1
Alexander's	1
people,	1
Moscow	1
with	1
its	1
innumerable	1
churches	1
shaped	1
like	1
Chinese	1
pagodas."	1
	1
"Well?"	1
asked	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
"One	1
of	1
Platov's	1
Cossacks	1
says	1
that	1
Platov's	1
corps	1
is	1
joining	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
main	1
army	1
and	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
has	1
been	1
appointed	1
commander-in-chief.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
shrewd	1
and	1
garrulous	1
fellow."	1
	1
Napoleon	1
smiled	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
Cossack	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
bring	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
himself.	1
Several	1
adjutants	1
galloped	1
off,	1
and	1
an	1
hour	1
later,	1
Lavrushka,	1
the	1
serf	1
Denisov	1
had	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
an	1
orderly's	1
jacket	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
French	1
cavalry	1
saddle,	1
with	1
a	1
merry,	1
and	1
tipsy	1
face.	1
Napoleon	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
ride	1
by	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
Cossack?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
Cossack,	1
your	1
Honor."	1
	1
"The	1
Cossack,	1
not	1
knowing	1
in	1
what	1
company	1
he	1
was,	1
for	1
Napoleon's	1
plain	1
appearance	1
had	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
that	1
would	1
reveal	1
to	1
an	1
Oriental	1
mind	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
monarch,	1
talked	1
with	1
extreme	1
familiarity	1
of	1
the	1
incidents	1
of	1
the	1
war,"	1
says	1
Thiers,	1
narrating	1
this	1
episode.	1
In	1
reality	1
Lavrushka,	1
having	1
got	1
drunk	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
left	1
his	1
master	1
dinnerless,	1
had	1
been	1
whipped	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
chickens,	1
where	1
he	1
engaged	1
in	1
looting	1
till	1
the	1
French	1
took	1
him	1
prisoner.	1
Lavrushka	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
coarse,	1
bare-faced	1
lackeys	1
who	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things,	1
consider	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
in	1
a	1
mean	1
and	1
cunning	1
way,	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
render	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
their	1
master,	1
and	1
are	1
keen	1
at	1
guessing	1
their	1
master's	1
baser	1
impulses,	1
especially	1
those	1
prompted	1
by	1
vanity	1
and	1
pettiness.	1
	1
Finding	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
whose	1
identity	1
he	1
had	1
easily	1
and	1
surely	1
recognized,	1
Lavrushka	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
abashed	1
but	1
merely	1
did	1
his	1
utmost	1
to	1
gain	1
his	1
new	1
master's	1
favor.	1
	1
He	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
Napoleon,	1
but	1
Napoleon's	1
presence	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
intimidate	1
him	1
than	1
Rostov's,	1
or	1
a	1
sergeant	1
major's	1
with	1
the	1
rods,	1
would	1
have	1
done,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
that	1
either	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major	1
or	1
Napoleon	1
could	1
deprive	1
him	1
of.	1
	1
So	1
he	1
rattled	1
on,	1
telling	1
all	1
the	1
gossip	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
among	1
the	1
orderlies.	1
Much	1
of	1
it	1
true.	1
But	1
when	1
Napoleon	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
the	1
Russians	1
thought	1
they	1
would	1
beat	1
Bonaparte	1
or	1
not,	1
Lavrushka	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
considered.	1
	1
In	1
this	1
question	1
he	1
saw	1
subtle	1
cunning,	1
as	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
type	1
see	1
cunning	1
in	1
everything,	1
so	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
immediately.	1
	1
"It's	1
like	1
this,"	1
he	1
said	1
thoughtfully,	1
"if	1
there's	1
a	1
battle	1
soon,	1
yours	1
will	1
win.	1
That's	1
right.	1
But	1
if	1
three	1
days	1
pass,	1
then	1
after	1
that,	1
well,	1
then	1
that	1
same	1
battle	1
will	1
not	1
soon	1
be	1
over."	1
	1
Lelorgne	1
d'Ideville	1
smilingly	1
interpreted	1
this	1
speech	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
thus:	1
"If	1
a	1
battle	1
takes	1
place	1
within	1
the	1
next	1
three	1
days	1
the	1
French	1
will	1
win,	1
but	1
if	1
later,	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
will	1
happen."	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
smile,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
in	1
high	1
good	1
humor,	1
and	1
he	1
ordered	1
these	1
words	1
to	1
be	1
repeated.	1
	1
Lavrushka	1
noticed	1
this	1
and	1
to	1
entertain	1
him	1
further,	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
Napoleon	1
was,	1
added:	1
	1
"We	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
Bonaparte	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
beaten	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
a	1
different	1
matter..."--without	1
knowing	1
why	1
or	1
how	1
this	1
bit	1
of	1
boastful	1
patriotism	1
slipped	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
The	1
interpreter	1
translated	1
these	1
words	1
without	1
the	1
last	1
phrase,	1
and	1
Bonaparte	1
smiled.	1
"The	1
young	1
Cossack	1
made	1
his	1
mighty	1
interlocutor	1
smile,"	1
says	1
Thiers.	1
After	1
riding	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
in	1
silence,	1
Napoleon	1
turned	1
to	1
Berthier	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself,	1
to	1
that	1
very	1
Emperor	1
who	1
had	1
written	1
his	1
immortally	1
victorious	1
name	1
on	1
the	1
Pyramids,	1
would	1
affect	1
this	1
enfant	1
du	1
Don.	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Child	1
of	1
the	1
Don."	1
	1
The	1
fact	1
was	1
accordingly	1
conveyed	1
to	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
Lavrushka,	1
understanding	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
to	1
perplex	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
expected	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
frightened,	1
to	1
gratify	1
his	1
new	1
masters	1
promptly	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
astonished	1
and	1
awe-struck,	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
wide,	1
and	1
assumed	1
the	1
expression	1
he	1
usually	1
put	1
on	1
when	1
taken	1
to	1
be	1
whipped.	1
"As	1
soon	1
as	1
Napoleon's	1
interpreter	1
had	1
spoken,"	1
says	1
Thiers,	1
"the	1
Cossack,	1
seized	1
by	1
amazement,	1
did	1
not	1
utter	1
another	1
word,	1
but	1
rode	1
on,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
conqueror	1
whose	1
fame	1
had	1
reached	1
him	1
across	1
the	1
steppes	1
of	1
the	1
East.	1
All	1
his	1
loquacity	1
was	1
suddenly	1
arrested	1
and	1
replaced	1
by	1
a	1
naive	1
and	1
silent	1
feeling	1
of	1
admiration.	1
Napoleon,	1
after	1
making	1
the	1
Cossack	1
a	1
present,	1
had	1
him	1
set	1
free	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
restored	1
to	1
its	1
native	1
fields."	1
	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
on,	1
dreaming	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
that	1
so	1
appealed	1
to	1
his	1
imagination,	1
and	1
"the	1
bird	1
restored	1
to	1
its	1
native	1
fields"	1
galloped	1
to	1
our	1
outposts,	1
inventing	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
place	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
relate	1
to	1
his	1
comrades.	1
What	1
had	1
really	1
taken	1
place	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
relate	1
because	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
worth	1
telling.	1
He	1
found	1
the	1
Cossacks,	1
inquired	1
for	1
the	1
regiment	1
operating	1
with	1
Platov's	1
detachment	1
and	1
by	1
evening	1
found	1
his	1
master,	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov,	1
quartered	1
at	1
Yankovo.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
just	1
mounting	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
ride	1
round	1
the	1
neighboring	1
villages	1
with	1
Ilyin;	1
he	1
let	1
Lavrushka	1
have	1
another	1
horse	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
along	1
with	1
him.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
danger	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
supposed.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
Alpatych	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
awake	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
dream.	1
He	1
ordered	1
the	1
militiamen	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
villages	1
and	1
armed,	1
and	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-	1
chief	1
informing	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
resolved	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
extremity	1
and	1
to	1
defend	1
it,	1
leaving	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
discretion	1
to	1
take	1
measures	1
or	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
where	1
one	1
of	1
Russia's	1
oldest	1
generals	1
would	1
be	1
captured	1
or	1
killed,	1
and	1
he	1
announced	1
to	1
his	1
household	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
remain	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
	1
But	1
while	1
himself	1
remaining,	1
he	1
gave	1
instructions	1
for	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Dessalles	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
prince	1
to	1
Bogucharovo	1
and	1
thence	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
alarmed	1
by	1
her	1
father's	1
feverish	1
and	1
sleepless	1
activity	1
after	1
his	1
previous	1
apathy,	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
alone	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
ventured	1
to	1
disobey	1
him.	1
She	1
refused	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
her	1
father's	1
fury	1
broke	1
over	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
terrible	1
storm.	1
He	1
repeated	1
every	1
injustice	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
inflicted	1
on	1
her.	1
Trying	1
to	1
convict	1
her,	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
him	1
out,	1
had	1
caused	1
his	1
quarrel	1
with	1
his	1
son,	1
had	1
harbored	1
nasty	1
suspicions	1
of	1
him,	1
making	1
it	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
to	1
poison	1
his	1
existence,	1
and	1
he	1
drove	1
her	1
from	1
his	1
study	1
telling	1
her	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
away	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
remember	1
her	1
existence	1
and	1
warned	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
dare	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
her.	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
feared,	1
order	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
force	1
but	1
only	1
told	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
her	1
cheered	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
She	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
proof	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
she	1
was	1
remaining	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
morning	1
after	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
left,	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
donned	1
his	1
full	1
uniform	1
and	1
prepared	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
His	1
caleche	1
was	1
already	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
saw	1
him	1
walk	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
his	1
uniform	1
wearing	1
all	1
his	1
orders	1
and	1
go	1
down	1
the	1
garden	1
to	1
review	1
his	1
armed	1
peasants	1
and	1
domestic	1
serfs.	1
She	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
window	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
voice	1
which	1
reached	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
garden.	1
Suddenly	1
several	1
men	1
came	1
running	1
up	1
the	1
avenue	1
with	1
frightened	1
faces.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
porch,	1
down	1
the	1
flower-bordered	1
path,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
avenue.	1
A	1
large	1
crowd	1
of	1
militiamen	1
and	1
domestics	1
were	1
moving	1
toward	1
her,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
midst	1
several	1
men	1
were	1
supporting	1
by	1
the	1
armpits	1
and	1
dragging	1
along	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
uniform	1
and	1
decorations.	1
She	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
play	1
of	1
the	1
sunlight	1
that	1
fell	1
in	1
small	1
round	1
spots	1
through	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
lime-tree	1
avenue,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sure	1
what	1
change	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
All	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
former	1
stern	1
and	1
determined	1
expression	1
had	1
altered	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
timidity	1
and	1
submission.	1
On	1
seeing	1
his	1
daughter	1
he	1
moved	1
his	1
helpless	1
lips	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
hoarse	1
sound.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
He	1
was	1
lifted	1
up,	1
carried	1
to	1
his	1
study,	1
and	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
couch	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
feared	1
of	1
late.	1
	1
The	1
doctor,	1
who	1
was	1
fetched	1
that	1
same	1
night,	1
bled	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
seizure	1
paralyzing	1
his	1
right	1
side.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
dangerous	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
and	1
next	1
day	1
they	1
moved	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
Bogucharovo,	1
the	1
doctor	1
accompanying	1
him.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
reached	1
Bogucharovo,	1
Dessalles	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
prince	1
had	1
already	1
left	1
for	1
Moscow.	1
	1
For	1
three	1
weeks	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
lay	1
stricken	1
by	1
paralysis	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
house	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
built	1
at	1
Bogucharovo,	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state,	1
getting	1
neither	1
better	1
nor	1
worse.	1
He	1
was	1
unconscious	1
and	1
lay	1
like	1
a	1
distorted	1
corpse.	1
He	1
muttered	1
unceasingly,	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
lips	1
twitching,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
tell	1
whether	1
he	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
him	1
or	1
not.	1
One	1
thing	1
was	1
certain--that	1
he	1
was	1
suffering	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something.	1
But	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
tell:	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
caprice	1
of	1
a	1
sick	1
and	1
half-crazy	1
man,	1
or	1
it	1
might	1
relate	1
to	1
public	1
affairs,	1
or	1
possibly	1
to	1
family	1
concerns.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
said	1
this	1
restlessness	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
anything	1
and	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
physical	1
causes;	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
thought	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
something,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
her	1
presence	1
always	1
increased	1
his	1
restlessness	1
confirmed	1
her	1
opinion.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
suffering	1
both	1
physically	1
and	1
mentally.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
recovery.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
travel,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
on	1
the	1
road.	1
"Would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
better	1
if	1
the	1
end	1
did	1
come,	1
the	1
very	1
end?"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sometimes	1
thought.	1
Night	1
and	1
day,	1
hardly	1
sleeping	1
at	1
all,	1
she	1
watched	1
him	1
and,	1
terrible	1
to	1
say,	1
often	1
watched	1
him	1
not	1
with	1
hope	1
of	1
finding	1
signs	1
of	1
improvement	1
but	1
wishing	1
to	1
find	1
symptoms	1
of	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
Strange	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
this	1
feeling	1
in	1
herself,	1
yet	1
there	1
it	1
was.	1
And	1
what	1
seemed	1
still	1
more	1
terrible	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
that	1
since	1
her	1
father's	1
illness	1
began	1
(perhaps	1
even	1
sooner,	1
when	1
she	1
stayed	1
with	1
him	1
expecting	1
something	1
to	1
happen),	1
all	1
the	1
personal	1
desires	1
and	1
hopes	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
or	1
sleeping	1
within	1
her	1
had	1
awakened.	1
Thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
entered	1
her	1
mind	1
for	1
years--thoughts	1
of	1
a	1
life	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
of	1
family	1
happiness--floated	1
continually	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
like	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
Thrust	1
them	1
aside	1
as	1
she	1
would,	1
questions	1
continually	1
recurred	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
order	1
her	1
life	1
now,	1
after	1
that.	1
These	1
were	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
knew	1
it.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
sole	1
weapon	1
against	1
him	1
was	1
prayer,	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
pray.	1
She	1
assumed	1
an	1
attitude	1
of	1
prayer,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
icons,	1
repeated	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
prayer,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
pray.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
a	1
different	1
world	1
had	1
now	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
her--the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
strenuous	1
and	1
free	1
activity,	1
quite	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
spiritual	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
till	1
now	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
confined	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
greatest	1
comfort	1
had	1
been	1
prayer.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
pray,	1
could	1
not	1
weep,	1
and	1
worldly	1
cares	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
becoming	1
dangerous	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Bogucharovo.	1
News	1
of	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
came	1
from	1
all	1
sides,	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
village,	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
Bogucharovo,	1
a	1
homestead	1
had	1
been	1
looted	1
by	1
French	1
marauders.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
insisted	1
on	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
moving	1
the	1
prince;	1
the	1
provincial	1
Marshal	1
of	1
the	1
Nobility	1
sent	1
an	1
official	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
rural	1
police	1
having	1
come	1
to	1
Bogucharovo	1
urged	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
only	1
some	1
twenty-five	1
miles	1
away,	1
that	1
French	1
proclamations	1
were	1
circulating	1
in	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
her	1
father	1
away	1
before	1
the	1
fifteenth,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
consequences.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
decided	1
to	1
leave	1
on	1
the	1
fifteenth.	1
The	1
cares	1
of	1
preparation	1
and	1
giving	1
orders,	1
for	1
which	1
everyone	1
came	1
to	1
her,	1
occupied	1
her	1
all	1
day.	1
She	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
as	1
usual,	1
without	1
undressing,	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
where	1
the	1
prince	1
lay.	1
Several	1
times,	1
waking	1
up,	1
she	1
heard	1
his	1
groans	1
and	1
muttering,	1
the	1
creak	1
of	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
Tikhon	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
when	1
they	1
turned	1
him	1
over.	1
Several	1
times	1
she	1
listened	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
his	1
mutterings	1
were	1
louder	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
turned	1
him	1
over	1
oftener.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
and	1
several	1
times	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
listened,	1
wishing	1
to	1
enter	1
but	1
not	1
deciding	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
Though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
saw	1
and	1
knew	1
how	1
unpleasant	1
every	1
sign	1
of	1
anxiety	1
on	1
his	1
account	1
was	1
to	1
him.	1
She	1
had	1
noticed	1
with	1
what	1
dissatisfaction	1
he	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
look	1
she	1
sometimes	1
involuntarily	1
fixed	1
on	1
him.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
her	1
going	1
in	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
an	1
unusual	1
hour	1
would	1
irritate	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
never	1
had	1
she	1
felt	1
so	1
grieved	1
for	1
him	1
or	1
so	1
much	1
afraid	1
of	1
losing	1
him.	1
She	1
recalled	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
act	1
of	1
his	1
found	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
of	1
her.	1
Occasionally	1
amid	1
these	1
memories	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
would	1
surge	1
into	1
her	1
imagination:	1
thoughts	1
of	1
how	1
things	1
would	1
be	1
after	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
how	1
her	1
new,	1
liberated	1
life	1
would	1
be	1
ordered.	1
But	1
she	1
drove	1
these	1
thoughts	1
away	1
with	1
disgust.	1
Toward	1
morning	1
he	1
became	1
quiet	1
and	1
she	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
	1
She	1
woke	1
late.	1
That	1
sincerity	1
which	1
often	1
comes	1
with	1
waking	1
showed	1
her	1
clearly	1
what	1
chiefly	1
concerned	1
her	1
about	1
her	1
father's	1
illness.	1
On	1
waking	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
behind	1
the	1
door	1
and,	1
hearing	1
him	1
groan,	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
still	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
could	1
have	1
happened?	1
What	1
did	1
I	1
want?	1
I	1
want	1
his	1
death!"	1
she	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
loathing	1
for	1
herself.	1
	1
She	1
washed,	1
dressed,	1
said	1
her	1
prayers,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
it	1
stood	1
carriages	1
without	1
horses	1
and	1
things	1
were	1
being	1
packed	1
into	1
the	1
vehicles.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
warm,	1
gray	1
morning.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
porch,	1
still	1
horrified	1
by	1
her	1
spiritual	1
baseness	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
arrange	1
her	1
thoughts	1
before	1
going	1
to	1
her	1
father.	1
The	1
doctor	1
came	1
downstairs	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
better	1
today,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
you.	1
One	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
something	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
saying.	1
His	1
head	1
is	1
clearer.	1
Come	1
in,	1
he	1
is	1
asking	1
for	1
you..."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
heart	1
beat	1
so	1
violently	1
at	1
this	1
news	1
that	1
she	1
grew	1
pale	1
and	1
leaned	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
to	1
keep	1
from	1
falling.	1
To	1
see	1
him,	1
talk	1
to	1
him,	1
feel	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
her	1
now	1
that	1
her	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
overflowing	1
with	1
those	1
dreadful,	1
wicked	1
temptations,	1
was	1
a	1
torment	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
terror.	1
	1
"Come,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
entered	1
her	1
father's	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
bed.	1
He	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
propped	1
up	1
high,	1
and	1
his	1
small	1
bony	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
knotted	1
purple	1
veins	1
were	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
quilt;	1
his	1
left	1
eye	1
gazed	1
straight	1
before	1
him,	1
his	1
right	1
eye	1
was	1
awry,	1
and	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
lips	1
motionless.	1
He	1
seemed	1
altogether	1
so	1
thin,	1
small,	1
and	1
pathetic.	1
His	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
shriveled	1
or	1
melted;	1
his	1
features	1
had	1
grown	1
smaller.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
hand.	1
His	1
left	1
hand	1
pressed	1
hers	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
come.	1
He	1
twitched	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
lips	1
quivered	1
angrily.	1
	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
dismay	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
of	1
her.	1
When	1
she	1
changed	1
her	1
position	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
left	1
eye	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
face	1
he	1
calmed	1
down,	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
for	1
some	1
seconds.	1
Then	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
tongue	1
moved,	1
sounds	1
came,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak,	1
gazing	1
timidly	1
and	1
imploringly	1
at	1
her,	1
evidently	1
afraid	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
Straining	1
all	1
her	1
faculties	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
The	1
comic	1
efforts	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
moved	1
his	1
tongue	1
made	1
her	1
drop	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
with	1
difficulty	1
repress	1
the	1
sobs	1
that	1
rose	1
to	1
her	1
throat.	1
He	1
said	1
something,	1
repeating	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
several	1
times.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
them,	1
but	1
tried	1
to	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
and	1
inquiringly	1
repeated	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
uttered.	1
	1
"Mmm...ar...ate...ate..."	1
he	1
repeated	1
several	1
times.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
impossible	1
to	1
understand	1
these	1
sounds.	1
The	1
doctor	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
guessed	1
them,	1
and	1
inquiringly	1
repeated:	1
"Mary,	1
are	1
you	1
afraid?"	1
The	1
prince	1
shook	1
his	1
head,	1
again	1
repeated	1
the	1
same	1
sounds.	1
	1
"My	1
mind,	1
my	1
mind	1
aches?"	1
questioned	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
mumbling	1
sound	1
in	1
confirmation	1
of	1
this,	1
took	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
began	1
pressing	1
it	1
to	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
his	1
breast	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
right	1
place	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
"Always	1
thoughts...	1
about	1
you...	1
thoughts..."	1
he	1
then	1
uttered	1
much	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
before,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
understood.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
pressed	1
her	1
head	1
against	1
his	1
hand,	1
trying	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
sobs	1
and	1
tears.	1
	1
He	1
moved	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
her	1
hair.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
calling	1
you	1
all	1
night..."	1
he	1
brought	1
out.	1
	1
"If	1
only	1
I	1
had	1
known..."	1
she	1
said	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
"I	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
come	1
in."	1
	1
He	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Weren't	1
you	1
asleep?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
sleep,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
shaking	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
Unconsciously	1
imitating	1
her	1
father,	1
she	1
now	1
tried	1
to	1
express	1
herself	1
as	1
he	1
did,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
by	1
signs,	1
and	1
her	1
tongue	1
too	1
seemed	1
to	1
move	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"Dear	1
one...	1
Dearest..."	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said,	1
but	1
from	1
his	1
look	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
uttered	1
a	1
tender	1
caressing	1
word	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
her	1
before.	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
come	1
in?"	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
was	1
wishing	1
for	1
his	1
death!"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
awhile.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you...	1
daughter	1
dear!...	1
for	1
all,	1
for	1
all...	1
forgive!...	1
thank	1
you!...	1
forgive!...	1
thank	1
you!..."	1
and	1
tears	1
began	1
to	1
flow	1
from	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Call	1
Andrew!"	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
a	1
childish,	1
timid	1
expression	1
of	1
doubt	1
showed	1
itself	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
	1
He	1
himself	1
seemed	1
aware	1
that	1
his	1
demand	1
was	1
meaningless.	1
So	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him,"	1
she	1
replied.	1
	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
timid	1
surprise.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"He's	1
with	1
the	1
army,	1
Father,	1
at	1
Smolensk."	1
	1
He	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
remained	1
silent	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
Then	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
doubts	1
and	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
understood	1
and	1
remembered	1
everything,	1
he	1
nodded	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
reopened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
softly	1
and	1
distinctly.	1
"Russia	1
has	1
perished.	1
They've	1
destroyed	1
her."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
sob,	1
and	1
again	1
tears	1
flowed	1
from	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
restrain	1
herself	1
and	1
wept	1
while	1
she	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
Again	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
His	1
sobs	1
ceased,	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
Tikhon,	1
understanding	1
him,	1
wiped	1
away	1
the	1
tears.	1
	1
Then	1
he	1
again	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
understand	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
Tikhon	1
understood	1
and	1
repeated	1
it.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
sought	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
mood	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
speaking.	1
She	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
Russia,	1
or	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
of	1
herself,	1
of	1
his	1
grandson,	1
or	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
death,	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
"Put	1
on	1
your	1
white	1
dress.	1
I	1
like	1
it,"	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Having	1
understood	1
this	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sobbed	1
still	1
louder,	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
taking	1
her	1
arm	1
led	1
her	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
veranda,	1
soothing	1
her	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
her	1
journey.	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
prince	1
again	1
began	1
speaking	1
about	1
his	1
son,	1
about	1
the	1
war,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
angrily	1
twitching	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
hoarse	1
voice,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
final	1
stroke.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
stayed	1
on	1
the	1
veranda.	1
The	1
day	1
had	1
cleared,	1
it	1
was	1
hot	1
and	1
sunny.	1
She	1
could	1
understand	1
nothing,	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
and	1
feel	1
nothing,	1
except	1
passionate	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
father,	1
love	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
till	1
that	1
moment.	1
She	1
ran	1
out	1
sobbing	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
pond,	1
along	1
the	1
avenues	1
of	1
young	1
lime	1
trees	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
planted.	1
	1
"Yes...	1
I...	1
I...	1
I	1
wished	1
for	1
his	1
death!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
wanted	1
it	1
to	1
end	1
quicker....	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
peace....	1
And	1
what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
me?	1
What	1
use	1
will	1
peace	1
be	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
here?"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
murmured,	1
pacing	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
hurried	1
steps	1
and	1
pressing	1
her	1
hands	1
to	1
her	1
bosom	1
which	1
heaved	1
with	1
convulsive	1
sobs.	1
	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
completed	1
the	1
tour	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
which	1
brought	1
her	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
she	1
saw	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne--who	1
had	1
remained	1
at	1
Bogucharovo	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
leave	1
it--coming	1
toward	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
stranger.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
Marshal	1
of	1
the	1
Nobility	1
of	1
the	1
district,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
personally	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
her	1
prompt	1
departure.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
listened	1
without	1
understanding	1
him;	1
she	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
offered	1
him	1
lunch,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
him.	1
Then,	1
excusing	1
herself,	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
room.	1
The	1
doctor	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
an	1
agitated	1
face	1
and	1
said	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
enter.	1
	1
"Go	1
away,	1
Princess!	1
Go	1
away...	1
go	1
away!"	1
	1
She	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
slope	1
by	1
the	1
pond,	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
see	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
long	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
woman's	1
footsteps	1
running	1
along	1
the	1
path.	1
She	1
rose	1
and	1
saw	1
Dunyasha	1
her	1
maid,	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
looking	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
who	1
stopped	1
suddenly	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
alarm	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
mistress.	1
	1
"Please	1
come,	1
Princess...	1
The	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Dunyasha	1
in	1
a	1
breaking	1
voice.	1
	1
"Immediately,	1
I'm	1
coming,	1
I'm	1
coming!"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess	1
hurriedly,	1
not	1
giving	1
Dunyasha	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying,	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
the	1
girl	1
she	1
ran	1
toward	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
it's	1
God's	1
will!	1
You	1
must	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
everything,"	1
said	1
the	1
Marshal,	1
meeting	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
door.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
alone;	1
it's	1
not	1
true!"	1
she	1
cried	1
angrily	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
tried	1
to	1
stop	1
her.	1
She	1
pushed	1
him	1
aside	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
father's	1
door.	1
"Why	1
are	1
these	1
people	1
with	1
frightened	1
faces	1
stopping	1
me?	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
any	1
of	1
them!	1
And	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
doing	1
here?"	1
she	1
thought.	1
She	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
bright	1
daylight	1
in	1
that	1
previously	1
darkened	1
room	1
startled	1
her.	1
In	1
the	1
room	1
were	1
her	1
nurse	1
and	1
other	1
women.	1
They	1
all	1
drew	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
bed,	1
making	1
way	1
for	1
her.	1
He	1
was	1
still	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
as	1
before,	1
but	1
the	1
stern	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
quiet	1
face	1
made	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
stop	1
short	1
on	1
the	1
threshold.	1
	1
"No,	1
he's	1
not	1
dead--it's	1
impossible!"	1
she	1
told	1
herself	1
and	1
approached	1
him,	1
and	1
repressing	1
the	1
terror	1
that	1
seized	1
her,	1
she	1
pressed	1
her	1
lips	1
to	1
his	1
cheek.	1
But	1
she	1
stepped	1
back	1
immediately.	1
All	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
tenderness	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
feeling	1
for	1
him	1
vanished	1
instantly	1
and	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
horror	1
at	1
what	1
lay	1
there	1
before	1
her.	1
"No,	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
more!	1
He	1
is	1
not,	1
but	1
here	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
is	1
something	1
unfamiliar	1
and	1
hostile,	1
some	1
dreadful,	1
terrifying,	1
and	1
repellent	1
mystery!"	1
And	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
doctor,	1
who	1
held	1
her	1
up.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Tikhon	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
the	1
women	1
washed	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
prince,	1
tied	1
his	1
head	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
that	1
the	1
mouth	1
should	1
not	1
stiffen	1
while	1
open,	1
and	1
with	1
another	1
handkerchief	1
tied	1
together	1
the	1
legs	1
that	1
were	1
already	1
spreading	1
apart.	1
Then	1
they	1
dressed	1
him	1
in	1
uniform	1
with	1
his	1
decorations	1
and	1
placed	1
his	1
shriveled	1
little	1
body	1
on	1
a	1
table.	1
Heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
who	1
arranged	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
when,	1
but	1
it	1
all	1
got	1
done	1
as	1
if	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
accord.	1
Toward	1
night	1
candles	1
were	1
burning	1
round	1
his	1
coffin,	1
a	1
pall	1
was	1
spread	1
over	1
it,	1
the	1
floor	1
was	1
strewn	1
with	1
sprays	1
of	1
juniper,	1
a	1
printed	1
band	1
was	1
tucked	1
in	1
under	1
his	1
shriveled	1
head,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
sat	1
a	1
chanter	1
reading	1
the	1
psalms.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
horses	1
shy	1
and	1
snort	1
and	1
gather	1
about	1
a	1
dead	1
horse,	1
so	1
the	1
inmates	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
strangers	1
crowded	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
round	1
the	1
coffin--the	1
Marshal,	1
the	1
village	1
Elder,	1
peasant	1
women--and	1
all	1
with	1
fixed	1
and	1
frightened	1
eyes,	1
crossing	1
themselves,	1
bowed	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
cold	1
and	1
stiffened	1
hand.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Until	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
settled	1
in	1
Bogucharovo	1
its	1
owners	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
absentees,	1
and	1
its	1
peasants	1
were	1
of	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
character	1
from	1
those	1
of	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
They	1
differed	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
speech,	1
dress,	1
and	1
disposition.	1
They	1
were	1
called	1
steppe	1
peasants.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
used	1
to	1
approve	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
endurance	1
at	1
work	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
to	1
help	1
with	1
the	1
harvest	1
or	1
to	1
dig	1
ponds,	1
and	1
ditches,	1
but	1
he	1
disliked	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
boorishness.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
last	1
stay	1
at	1
Bogucharovo,	1
when	1
he	1
introduced	1
hospitals	1
and	1
schools	1
and	1
reduced	1
the	1
quitrent	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
to	1
pay,	1
had	1
not	1
softened	1
their	1
disposition	1
but	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
strengthened	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
traits	1
of	1
character	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
called	1
boorishness.	1
Various	1
obscure	1
rumors	1
were	1
always	1
current	1
among	1
them:	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
a	1
rumor	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
all	1
be	1
enrolled	1
as	1
Cossacks;	1
at	1
another	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
religion	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
converted;	1
then	1
of	1
some	1
proclamation	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar	1
Paul	1
in	1
1797	1
(in	1
connection	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
rumored	1
that	1
freedom	1
had	1
been	1
granted	1
them	1
but	1
the	1
landowners	1
had	1
stopped	1
it),	1
then	1
of	1
Peter	1
Fedorovich's	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
throne	1
in	1
seven	1
years'	1
time,	1
when	1
everything	1
would	1
be	1
made	1
free	1
and	1
so	1
"simple"	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
restrictions.	1
Rumors	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Bonaparte	1
and	1
his	1
invasion	1
were	1
connected	1
in	1
their	1
minds	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
vague	1
notions	1
of	1
Antichrist,	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
"pure	1
freedom."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
Bogucharovo	1
were	1
large	1
villages	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
crown	1
or	1
to	1
owners	1
whose	1
serfs	1
paid	1
quitrent	1
and	1
could	1
work	1
where	1
they	1
pleased.	1
There	1
were	1
very	1
few	1
resident	1
landlords	1
in	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
and	1
also	1
very	1
few	1
domestic	1
or	1
literate	1
serfs,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
the	1
peasantry	1
of	1
those	1
parts	1
the	1
mysterious	1
undercurrents	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people,	1
the	1
causes	1
and	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
baffling	1
to	1
contemporaries,	1
were	1
more	1
clearly	1
and	1
strongly	1
noticeable	1
than	1
among	1
others.	1
One	1
instance,	1
which	1
had	1
occurred	1
some	1
twenty	1
years	1
before,	1
was	1
a	1
movement	1
among	1
the	1
peasants	1
to	1
emigrate	1
to	1
some	1
unknown	1
"warm	1
rivers."	1
Hundreds	1
of	1
peasants,	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
Bogucharovo	1
folk,	1
suddenly	1
began	1
selling	1
their	1
cattle	1
and	1
moving	1
in	1
whole	1
families	1
toward	1
the	1
southeast.	1
As	1
birds	1
migrate	1
to	1
somewhere	1
beyond	1
the	1
sea,	1
so	1
these	1
men	1
with	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
children	1
streamed	1
to	1
the	1
southeast,	1
to	1
parts	1
where	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
ever	1
been.	1
They	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
caravans,	1
bought	1
their	1
freedom	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
ran	1
away,	1
and	1
drove	1
or	1
walked	1
toward	1
the	1
"warm	1
rivers."	1
Many	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
punished,	1
some	1
sent	1
to	1
Siberia,	1
many	1
died	1
of	1
cold	1
and	1
hunger	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
many	1
returned	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord,	1
and	1
the	1
movement	1
died	1
down	1
of	1
itself	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
sprung	1
up,	1
without	1
apparent	1
reason.	1
But	1
such	1
undercurrents	1
still	1
existed	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
gathered	1
new	1
forces	1
ready	1
to	1
manifest	1
themselves	1
just	1
as	1
strangely,	1
unexpectedly,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
simply,	1
naturally,	1
and	1
forcibly.	1
Now	1
in	1
1812,	1
to	1
anyone	1
living	1
in	1
close	1
touch	1
with	1
these	1
people	1
it	1
was	1
apparent	1
that	1
these	1
undercurrents	1
were	1
acting	1
strongly	1
and	1
nearing	1
an	1
eruption.	1
	1
Alpatych,	1
who	1
had	1
reached	1
Bogucharovo	1
shortly	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
death,	1
noticed	1
an	1
agitation	1
among	1
the	1
peasants,	1
and	1
that	1
contrary	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
the	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
district,	1
where	1
over	1
a	1
radius	1
of	1
forty	1
miles	1
all	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
moving	1
away	1
and	1
leaving	1
their	1
villages	1
to	1
be	1
devastated	1
by	1
the	1
Cossacks,	1
the	1
peasants	1
in	1
the	1
steppe	1
region	1
round	1
Bogucharovo	1
were,	1
it	1
was	1
rumored,	1
in	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
French,	1
received	1
leaflets	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
passed	1
from	1
hand	1
to	1
hand,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
migrate.	1
He	1
learned	1
from	1
domestic	1
serfs	1
loyal	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
peasant	1
Karp,	1
who	1
possessed	1
great	1
influence	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
commune	1
and	1
had	1
recently	1
been	1
away	1
driving	1
a	1
government	1
transport,	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
destroying	1
deserted	1
villages,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
did	1
not	1
harm	1
them.	1
Alpatych	1
also	1
knew	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
another	1
peasant	1
had	1
even	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Visloukhovo,	1
which	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
a	1
proclamation	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
general	1
that	1
no	1
harm	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
remained	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
paid	1
for	1
anything	1
taken	1
from	1
them.	1
As	1
proof	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
peasant	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
Visloukhovo	1
a	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
in	1
notes	1
(he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
false)	1
paid	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
advance	1
for	1
hay.	1
	1
More	1
important	1
still,	1
Alpatych	1
learned	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
village	1
Elder	1
orders	1
to	1
collect	1
carts	1
to	1
move	1
the	1
princess'	1
luggage	1
from	1
Bogucharovo,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
village	1
meeting	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
move	1
but	1
to	1
wait.	1
Yet	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
waste.	1
On	1
the	1
fifteenth,	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
death,	1
the	1
Marshal	1
had	1
insisted	1
on	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
leaving	1
at	1
once,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
becoming	1
dangerous.	1
He	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
responsible	1
for	1
what	1
might	1
happen.	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
died	1
the	1
Marshal	1
went	1
away,	1
promising	1
to	1
return	1
next	1
day	1
for	1
the	1
funeral.	1
But	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
do,	1
for	1
he	1
received	1
tidings	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
advanced,	1
and	1
had	1
barely	1
time	1
to	1
remove	1
his	1
own	1
family	1
and	1
valuables	1
from	1
his	1
estate.	1
	1
For	1
some	1
thirty	1
years	1
Bogucharovo	1
had	1
been	1
managed	1
by	1
the	1
village	1
Elder,	1
Dron,	1
whom	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
diminutive	1
"Dronushka."	1
	1
Dron	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
physically	1
and	1
mentally	1
vigorous	1
peasants	1
who	1
grow	1
big	1
beards	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
age	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
unchanged	1
till	1
they	1
are	1
sixty	1
or	1
seventy,	1
without	1
a	1
gray	1
hair	1
or	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
tooth,	1
as	1
straight	1
and	1
strong	1
at	1
sixty	1
as	1
at	1
thirty.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
the	1
migration	1
to	1
the	1
"warm	1
rivers,"	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
like	1
the	1
rest,	1
Dron	1
was	1
made	1
village	1
Elder	1
and	1
overseer	1
of	1
Bogucharovo,	1
and	1
had	1
since	1
filled	1
that	1
post	1
irreproachably	1
for	1
twenty-	1
three	1
years.	1
The	1
peasants	1
feared	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
did	1
their	1
master.	1
The	1
masters,	1
both	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
the	1
young,	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
respected	1
him	1
and	1
jestingly	1
called	1
him	1
"the	1
Minister."	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
service	1
Dron	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
drunk	1
or	1
ill,	1
never	1
after	1
sleepless	1
nights	1
or	1
the	1
hardest	1
tasks	1
had	1
he	1
shown	1
the	1
least	1
fatigue,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
forgotten	1
a	1
single	1
money	1
account	1
or	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
quarters	1
of	1
flour	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
endless	1
cartloads	1
he	1
sold	1
for	1
the	1
prince,	1
nor	1
a	1
single	1
shock	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
corn	1
crop	1
on	1
any	1
single	1
acre	1
of	1
the	1
Bogucharovo	1
fields.	1
	1
Alpatych,	1
arriving	1
from	1
the	1
devastated	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
estate,	1
sent	1
for	1
his	1
Dron	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
prince's	1
funeral	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
twelve	1
horses	1
got	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
princess'	1
carriages	1
and	1
eighteen	1
carts	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
from	1
Bogucharovo.	1
Though	1
the	1
peasants	1
paid	1
quitrent,	1
Alpatych	1
thought	1
no	1
difficulty	1
would	1
be	1
made	1
about	1
complying	1
with	1
this	1
order,	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
households	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
Bogucharovo	1
and	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
well	1
to	1
do.	1
But	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
order	1
Dron	1
lowered	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
remained	1
silent.	1
Alpatych	1
named	1
certain	1
peasants	1
he	1
knew,	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
carts.	1
	1
Dron	1
replied	1
that	1
the	1
horses	1
of	1
these	1
peasants	1
were	1
away	1
carting.	1
Alpatych	1
named	1
others,	1
but	1
they	1
too,	1
according	1
to	1
Dron,	1
had	1
no	1
horses	1
available:	1
some	1
horses	1
were	1
carting	1
for	1
the	1
government,	1
others	1
were	1
too	1
weak,	1
and	1
others	1
had	1
died	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
fodder.	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
no	1
horses	1
could	1
be	1
had	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
carriages,	1
much	1
less	1
for	1
the	1
carting.	1
	1
Alpatych	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
Dron	1
and	1
frowned.	1
Just	1
as	1
Dron	1
was	1
a	1
model	1
village	1
Elder,	1
so	1
Alpatych	1
had	1
not	1
managed	1
the	1
prince's	1
estates	1
for	1
twenty	1
years	1
in	1
vain.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
model	1
steward,	1
possessing	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
divining	1
the	1
needs	1
and	1
instincts	1
of	1
those	1
he	1
dealt	1
with.	1
Having	1
glanced	1
at	1
Dron	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
understood	1
that	1
his	1
answers	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
his	1
personal	1
views	1
but	1
the	1
general	1
mood	1
of	1
the	1
Bogucharovo	1
commune,	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
Elder	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
carried	1
away.	1
But	1
he	1
also	1
knew	1
that	1
Dron,	1
who	1
had	1
acquired	1
property	1
and	1
was	1
hated	1
by	1
the	1
commune,	1
must	1
be	1
hesitating	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
camps:	1
the	1
masters'	1
and	1
the	1
serfs'.	1
He	1
noticed	1
this	1
hesitation	1
in	1
Dron's	1
look	1
and	1
therefore	1
frowned	1
and	1
moved	1
closer	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Now	1
just	1
listen,	1
Dronushka,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
nonsense	1
to	1
me.	1
His	1
excellency	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
himself	1
gave	1
me	1
orders	1
to	1
move	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
away	1
and	1
not	1
leave	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
order	1
from	1
the	1
Tsar	1
about	1
it	1
too.	1
Anyone	1
who	1
stays	1
is	1
a	1
traitor	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar.	1
Do	1
you	1
hear?"	1
	1
"I	1
hear,"	1
Dron	1
answered	1
without	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
Alpatych	1
was	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
reply.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
Dron,	1
it	1
will	1
turn	1
out	1
badly!"	1
he	1
said,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"The	1
power	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
hands,"	1
Dron	1
rejoined	1
sadly.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
Dron,	1
drop	1
it!"	1
Alpatych	1
repeated,	1
withdrawing	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
his	1
bosom	1
and	1
solemnly	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
floor	1
at	1
Dron's	1
feet.	1
"I	1
can	1
see	1
through	1
you	1
and	1
three	1
yards	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
under	1
you,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Dron.	1
	1
Dron	1
was	1
disconcerted,	1
glanced	1
furtively	1
at	1
Alpatych	1
and	1
again	1
lowered	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"You	1
drop	1
this	1
nonsense	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
to	1
leave	1
their	1
homes	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
carts	1
ready	1
for	1
tomorrow	1
morning	1
for	1
the	1
princess'	1
things.	1
And	1
don't	1
go	1
to	1
any	1
meeting	1
yourself,	1
do	1
you	1
hear?"	1
	1
Dron	1
suddenly	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees.	1
	1
"Yakov	1
Alpatych,	1
discharge	1
me!	1
Take	1
the	1
keys	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
discharge	1
me,	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake!"	1
	1
"Stop	1
that!"	1
cried	1
Alpatych	1
sternly.	1
"I	1
see	1
through	1
you	1
and	1
three	1
yards	1
under	1
you,"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
knowing	1
that	1
his	1
skill	1
in	1
beekeeping,	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
time	1
to	1
sow	1
the	1
oats,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
favor	1
for	1
twenty	1
years	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
gained	1
him	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
wizard,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
seeing	1
three	1
yards	1
under	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
considered	1
an	1
attribute	1
of	1
wizards.	1
	1
Dron	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
Alpatych	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
into	1
your	1
heads,	1
eh?...	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
of,	1
eh?"	1
	1
"What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
people?"	1
said	1
Dron.	1
"They're	1
quite	1
beside	1
themselves;	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
them..."	1
	1
"'Told	1
them,'	1
I	1
dare	1
say!"	1
said	1
Alpatych.	1
"Are	1
they	1
drinking?"	1
he	1
asked	1
abruptly.	1
	1
"Quite	1
beside	1
themselves,	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych;	1
they've	1
fetched	1
another	1
barrel."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
listen!	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
police	1
officer,	1
and	1
you	1
tell	1
them	1
so,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
stop	1
this	1
and	1
the	1
carts	1
must	1
be	1
got	1
ready."	1
	1
"I	1
understand."	1
	1
Alpatych	1
did	1
not	1
insist	1
further.	1
He	1
had	1
managed	1
people	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
way	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
obey	1
is	1
to	1
show	1
no	1
suspicion	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
possibly	1
disobey.	1
Having	1
wrung	1
a	1
submissive	1
"I	1
understand"	1
from	1
Dron,	1
Alpatych	1
contented	1
himself	1
with	1
that,	1
though	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
doubted	1
but	1
felt	1
almost	1
certain	1
that	1
without	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
troops	1
the	1
carts	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
forthcoming.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
for	1
when	1
evening	1
came	1
no	1
carts	1
had	1
been	1
provided.	1
In	1
the	1
village,	1
outside	1
the	1
drink	1
shop,	1
another	1
meeting	1
was	1
being	1
held,	1
which	1
decided	1
that	1
the	1
horses	1
should	1
be	1
driven	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
the	1
carts	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
provided.	1
Without	1
saying	1
anything	1
of	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
princess,	1
Alpatych	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
belongings	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carts	1
which	1
had	1
arrived	1
from	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
and	1
had	1
those	1
horses	1
got	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
princess'	1
carriages.	1
Meanwhile	1
he	1
went	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
police	1
authorities.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
After	1
her	1
father's	1
funeral	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
shut	1
herself	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
anyone.	1
A	1
maid	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
Alpatych	1
was	1
asking	1
for	1
orders	1
about	1
their	1
departure.	1
(This	1
was	1
before	1
his	1
talk	1
with	1
Dron.)	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
raised	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
lying	1
and	1
replied	1
through	1
the	1
closed	1
door	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
begged	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
The	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
lying	1
looked	1
westward.	1
She	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
with	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall,	1
fingering	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
the	1
leather	1
cushion	1
and	1
seeing	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
cushion,	1
and	1
her	1
confused	1
thoughts	1
were	1
centered	1
on	1
one	1
subject--the	1
irrevocability	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
spiritual	1
baseness,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
suspected,	1
but	1
which	1
had	1
shown	1
itself	1
during	1
her	1
father's	1
illness.	1
She	1
wished	1
to	1
pray	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to,	1
dared	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
address	1
herself	1
to	1
God.	1
She	1
lay	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
that	1
position.	1
	1
The	1
sun	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
its	1
slanting	1
rays	1
shone	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
window,	1
lighting	1
up	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
morocco	1
cushion	1
at	1
which	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
looking.	1
The	1
flow	1
of	1
her	1
thoughts	1
suddenly	1
stopped.	1
Unconsciously	1
she	1
sat	1
up,	1
smoothed	1
her	1
hair,	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
involuntarily	1
inhaling	1
the	1
freshness	1
of	1
the	1
clear	1
but	1
windy	1
evening.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
can	1
well	1
enjoy	1
the	1
evening	1
now!	1
He	1
is	1
gone	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
hinder	1
you,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
sinking	1
into	1
a	1
chair	1
she	1
let	1
her	1
head	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill.	1
	1
Someone	1
spoke	1
her	1
name	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
and	1
tender	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
head.	1
She	1
looked	1
up.	1
It	1
was	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
dress	1
and	1
weepers.	1
She	1
softly	1
approached	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
sighed,	1
kissed	1
her,	1
and	1
immediately	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
The	1
princess	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
her.	1
All	1
their	1
former	1
disharmony	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
jealousy	1
recurred	1
to	1
her	1
mind.	1
But	1
she	1
remembered	1
too	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
of	1
late	1
toward	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
thereby	1
showing	1
how	1
unjust	1
were	1
the	1
reproaches	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
mentally	1
addressed	1
to	1
her.	1
"Besides,	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
me,	1
for	1
me	1
who	1
desired	1
his	1
death,	1
to	1
condemn	1
anyone?"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
vividly	1
pictured	1
to	1
herself	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
kept	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
but	1
who	1
yet	1
was	1
dependent	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
living	1
in	1
her	1
house.	1
She	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
of	1
gentle	1
inquiry.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
crying	1
again	1
and	1
kissed	1
that	1
hand,	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
princess'	1
sorrow	1
and	1
making	1
herself	1
a	1
partner	1
in	1
it.	1
She	1
said	1
her	1
only	1
consolation	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
share	1
her	1
sorrow,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
misunderstandings	1
should	1
sink	1
into	1
nothing	1
but	1
this	1
great	1
grief;	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
blameless	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
everyone,	1
and	1
that	1
he,	1
from	1
above,	1
saw	1
her	1
affection	1
and	1
gratitude.	1
The	1
princess	1
heard	1
her,	1
not	1
heeding	1
her	1
words	1
but	1
occasionally	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
voice.	1
	1
"Your	1
position	1
is	1
doubly	1
terrible,	1
dear	1
princess,"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
"I	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
not,	1
and	1
cannot,	1
think	1
of	1
yourself,	1
but	1
with	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
so....	1
Has	1
Alpatych	1
been	1
to	1
you?	1
Has	1
he	1
spoken	1
to	1
you	1
of	1
going	1
away?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
or	1
where	1
to.	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
plan	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
now?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
same?"	1
she	1
thought,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
chere	1
Marie,"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
"that	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
danger--are	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
French.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
dangerous	1
to	1
move	1
now.	1
If	1
we	1
go	1
we	1
are	1
almost	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
God	1
knows..."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
companion	1
without	1
understanding	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
about.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
anyone	1
knew	1
how	1
little	1
anything	1
matters	1
to	1
me	1
now,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"Of	1
course	1
I	1
would	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
wish	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
from	1
him....	1
Alpatych	1
did	1
say	1
something	1
about	1
going....	1
Speak	1
to	1
him;	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
nothing,	1
nothing,	1
and	1
don't	1
want	1
to...."	1
	1
"I've	1
spoken	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
hopes	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
tomorrow,	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
stay	1
here,"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
"Because,	1
you	1
will	1
agree,	1
chere	1
Marie,	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
or	1
of	1
riotous	1
peasants	1
would	1
be	1
terrible."	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
took	1
from	1
her	1
reticule	1
a	1
proclamation	1
(not	1
printed	1
on	1
ordinary	1
Russian	1
paper)	1
of	1
General	1
Rameau's,	1
telling	1
people	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
their	1
homes	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
authorities	1
would	1
afford	1
them	1
proper	1
protection.	1
She	1
handed	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
appeal	1
to	1
that	1
general,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
all	1
due	1
respect	1
would	1
be	1
shown	1
you."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
read	1
the	1
paper,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
quiver	1
with	1
stifled	1
sobs.	1
	1
"From	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
this?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"They	1
probably	1
recognized	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
French,	1
by	1
my	1
name,"	1
replied	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
blushing.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
with	1
the	1
paper	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
face	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
into	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
study.	1
	1
"Dunyasha,	1
send	1
Alpatych,	1
or	1
Dronushka,	1
or	1
somebody	1
to	1
me!"	1
she	1
said,	1
"and	1
tell	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
not	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
me,"	1
she	1
added,	1
hearing	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
voice.	1
"We	1
must	1
go	1
at	1
once,	1
at	1
once!"	1
she	1
said,	1
appalled	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
"If	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
heard	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
French!	1
That	1
I,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski,	1
asked	1
General	1
Rameau	1
for	1
protection	1
and	1
accepted	1
his	1
favor!"	1
This	1
idea	1
horrified	1
her,	1
made	1
her	1
shudder,	1
blush,	1
and	1
feel	1
such	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
pride	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
experienced	1
before.	1
All	1
that	1
was	1
distressing,	1
and	1
especially	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
humiliating,	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
rose	1
vividly	1
to	1
her	1
mind.	1
"They,	1
the	1
French,	1
would	1
settle	1
in	1
this	1
house:	1
M.	1
le	1
General	1
Rameau	1
would	1
occupy	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
study	1
and	1
amuse	1
himself	1
by	1
looking	1
through	1
and	1
reading	1
his	1
letters	1
and	1
papers.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
honors	1
of	1
Bogucharovo	1
for	1
him.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
a	1
small	1
room	1
as	1
a	1
favor,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
would	1
violate	1
my	1
father's	1
newly	1
dug	1
grave	1
to	1
steal	1
his	1
crosses	1
and	1
stars,	1
they	1
would	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
their	1
victories	1
over	1
the	1
Russians,	1
and	1
would	1
pretend	1
to	1
sympathize	1
with	1
my	1
sorrow..."	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
not	1
thinking	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts	1
but	1
feeling	1
bound	1
to	1
think	1
like	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
her	1
brother.	1
For	1
herself	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
where	1
she	1
remained	1
or	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
her	1
dead	1
father	1
and	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
Involuntarily	1
she	1
thought	1
their	1
thoughts	1
and	1
felt	1
their	1
feelings.	1
What	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
she	1
felt	1
bound	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
do.	1
She	1
went	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
study,	1
trying	1
to	1
enter	1
completely	1
into	1
his	1
ideas,	1
and	1
considered	1
her	1
position.	1
	1
The	1
demands	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
annihilated	1
by	1
her	1
father's	1
death,	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
rose	1
before	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
new,	1
previously	1
unknown	1
force	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
Agitated	1
and	1
flushed	1
she	1
paced	1
the	1
room,	1
sending	1
now	1
for	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
Tikhon	1
or	1
Dron.	1
Dunyasha,	1
the	1
nurse,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
maids	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
statement	1
was	1
correct.	1
Alpatych	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
home,	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
police.	1
Neither	1
could	1
the	1
architect	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
who	1
on	1
being	1
sent	1
for	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
sleepy	1
eyes,	1
tell	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
anything.	1
With	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
of	1
agreement	1
with	1
which	1
for	1
fifteen	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
without	1
expressing	1
views	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
he	1
now	1
replied	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
so	1
that	1
nothing	1
definite	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
from	1
his	1
answers.	1
The	1
old	1
valet	1
Tikhon,	1
with	1
sunken,	1
emaciated	1
face	1
that	1
bore	1
the	1
stamp	1
of	1
inconsolable	1
grief,	1
replied:	1
"Yes,	1
Princess"	1
to	1
all	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
questions	1
and	1
hardly	1
refrained	1
from	1
sobbing	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
At	1
length	1
Dron,	1
the	1
village	1
Elder,	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
bow	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
halt	1
by	1
the	1
doorpost.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Dronushka,"	1
she	1
said,	1
regarding	1
as	1
a	1
sure	1
friend	1
this	1
Dronushka	1
who	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
special	1
kind	1
of	1
gingerbread	1
from	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
fair	1
at	1
Vyazma	1
every	1
year	1
and	1
smilingly	1
offer	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
"Dronushka,	1
now	1
since	1
our	1
misfortune..."	1
she	1
began,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
God's	1
hands,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
	1
"Dronushka,	1
Alpatych	1
has	1
gone	1
off	1
somewhere	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
turn	1
to.	1
Is	1
it	1
true,	1
as	1
they	1
tell	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
can't	1
even	1
go	1
away?"	1
	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
you	1
go	1
away,	1
your	1
excellency?	1
You	1
can	1
go,"	1
said	1
Dron.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
told	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
dangerous	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Dear	1
friend,	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
nothing.	1
I	1
understand	1
nothing.	1
I	1
have	1
nobody!	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
tonight	1
or	1
early	1
tomorrow	1
morning."	1
	1
Dron	1
paused.	1
He	1
looked	1
askance	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
said:	1
"There	1
are	1
no	1
horses;	1
I	1
told	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych	1
so."	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
there	1
none?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
God's	1
scourge,"	1
said	1
Dron.	1
"What	1
horses	1
we	1
had	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
the	1
army	1
or	1
have	1
died--this	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
year!	1
It's	1
not	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
feeding	1
horses--we	1
may	1
die	1
of	1
hunger	1
ourselves!	1
As	1
it	1
is,	1
some	1
go	1
three	1
days	1
without	1
eating.	1
We've	1
nothing,	1
we've	1
been	1
ruined."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
told	1
her.	1
	1
"The	1
peasants	1
are	1
ruined?	1
They	1
have	1
no	1
bread?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"They're	1
dying	1
of	1
hunger,"	1
said	1
Dron.	1
"It's	1
not	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
carting."	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
tell	1
me,	1
Dronushka?	1
Isn't	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
help	1
them?	1
I'll	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
can...."	1
	1
To	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
it	1
was	1
strange	1
that	1
now,	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
such	1
sorrow	1
was	1
filling	1
her	1
soul,	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
rich	1
people	1
and	1
poor,	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
could	1
refrain	1
from	1
helping	1
the	1
poor.	1
She	1
had	1
heard	1
vaguely	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
"landlord's	1
corn"	1
which	1
was	1
sometimes	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
peasants.	1
She	1
also	1
knew	1
that	1
neither	1
her	1
father	1
nor	1
her	1
brother	1
would	1
refuse	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
peasants	1
in	1
need,	1
she	1
only	1
feared	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
mistake	1
in	1
speaking	1
about	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
the	1
grain	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
give.	1
She	1
was	1
glad	1
such	1
cares	1
presented	1
themselves,	1
enabling	1
her	1
without	1
scruple	1
to	1
forget	1
her	1
own	1
grief.	1
She	1
began	1
asking	1
Dron	1
about	1
the	1
peasants'	1
needs	1
and	1
what	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
Bogucharovo	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
landlord.	1
	1
"But	1
we	1
have	1
grain	1
belonging	1
to	1
my	1
brother?"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"The	1
landlord's	1
grain	1
is	1
all	1
safe,"	1
replied	1
Dron	1
proudly.	1
"Our	1
prince	1
did	1
not	1
order	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
sold."	1
	1
"Give	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
peasants,	1
let	1
them	1
have	1
all	1
they	1
need;	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
leave	1
in	1
my	1
brother's	1
name,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Dron	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
sighed	1
deeply.	1
	1
"Give	1
them	1
that	1
corn	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
enough	1
of	1
it.	1
Distribute	1
it	1
all.	1
I	1
give	1
this	1
order	1
in	1
my	1
brother's	1
name;	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
what	1
is	1
ours	1
is	1
theirs.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
grudge	1
them	1
anything.	1
Tell	1
them	1
so."	1
	1
Dron	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
speaking.	1
	1
"Discharge	1
me,	1
little	1
mother,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!	1
Order	1
the	1
keys	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
me,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
have	1
served	1
twenty-three	1
years	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
no	1
wrong.	1
Discharge	1
me,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
of	1
her	1
or	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
asking	1
to	1
be	1
discharged.	1
She	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
doubted	1
his	1
devotion	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
peasants.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
An	1
hour	1
later	1
Dunyasha	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
Dron	1
had	1
come,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
assembled	1
at	1
the	1
barn	1
by	1
the	1
princess'	1
order	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
word	1
with	1
their	1
mistress.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
never	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
come,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"I	1
only	1
told	1
Dron	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
have	1
the	1
grain."	1
	1
"Only,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
Princess	1
dear,	1
have	1
them	1
sent	1
away	1
and	1
don't	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
them.	1
It's	1
all	1
a	1
trick,"	1
said	1
Dunyasha,	1
"and	1
when	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych	1
returns	1
let	1
us	1
get	1
away...	1
and	1
please	1
don't..."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
a	1
trick?"	1
asked	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
surprise.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
it	1
is,	1
only	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!	1
Ask	1
nurse	1
too.	1
They	1
say	1
they	1
don't	1
agree	1
to	1
leave	1
Bogucharovo	1
as	1
you	1
ordered."	1
	1
"You're	1
making	1
some	1
mistake.	1
I	1
never	1
ordered	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
away,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Call	1
Dronushka."	1
	1
Dron	1
came	1
and	1
confirmed	1
Dunyasha's	1
words;	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
princess'	1
order.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
never	1
sent	1
for	1
them,"	1
declared	1
the	1
princess.	1
"You	1
must	1
have	1
given	1
my	1
message	1
wrong.	1
I	1
only	1
said	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
grain."	1
	1
Dron	1
only	1
sighed	1
in	1
reply.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
order	1
it	1
they	1
will	1
go	1
away,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"No,	1
no.	1
I'll	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
them,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
nurse's	1
and	1
Dunyasha's	1
protests	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch;	1
Dron,	1
Dunyasha,	1
the	1
nurse,	1
and	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
following	1
her.	1
	1
"They	1
probably	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
offering	1
them	1
the	1
grain	1
to	1
bribe	1
them	1
to	1
remain	1
here,	1
while	1
I	1
myself	1
go	1
away	1
leaving	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
French,"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"I	1
will	1
offer	1
them	1
monthly	1
rations	1
and	1
housing	1
at	1
our	1
Moscow	1
estate.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Andrew	1
would	1
do	1
even	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
place,"	1
she	1
thought	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
toward	1
the	1
crowd	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
pasture	1
by	1
the	1
barn.	1
	1
The	1
men	1
crowded	1
closer	1
together,	1
stirred,	1
and	1
rapidly	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
hats.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
lowered	1
her	1
eyes	1
and,	1
tripping	1
over	1
her	1
skirt,	1
came	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
So	1
many	1
different	1
eyes,	1
old	1
and	1
young,	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
different	1
faces,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
and,	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
speak	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
But	1
again	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
she	1
represented	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
gave	1
her	1
courage,	1
and	1
she	1
boldly	1
began	1
her	1
speech.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
come,"	1
she	1
said	1
without	1
raising	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
feeling	1
her	1
heart	1
beating	1
quickly	1
and	1
violently.	1
"Dronushka	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
has	1
ruined	1
you.	1
That	1
is	1
our	1
common	1
misfortune,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
grudge	1
nothing	1
to	1
help	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
going	1
away	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
dangerous	1
here...	1
the	1
enemy	1
is	1
near...	1
because...	1
I	1
am	1
giving	1
you	1
everything,	1
my	1
friends,	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
everything,	1
all	1
our	1
grain,	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
suffer	1
want!	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
giving	1
you	1
the	1
grain	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
here--that	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
belongings	1
to	1
our	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
I	1
promise	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
there	1
you	1
shall	1
want	1
for	1
nothing.	1
You	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
food	1
and	1
lodging."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
stopped.	1
Sighs	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
sound	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
doing	1
this	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
account,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
"I	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
dead	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
master	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
son."	1
	1
Again	1
she	1
paused.	1
No	1
one	1
broke	1
the	1
silence.	1
	1
"Ours	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
misfortune	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
share	1
it	1
together.	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
mine	1
is	1
yours,"	1
she	1
concluded,	1
scanning	1
the	1
faces	1
before	1
her.	1
	1
All	1
eyes	1
were	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
expression.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
fathom	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
curiosity,	1
devotion,	1
gratitude,	1
or	1
apprehension	1
and	1
distrust--but	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
was	1
identical.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
all	1
very	1
thankful	1
for	1
your	1
bounty,	1
but	1
it	1
won't	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
landlord's	1
grain,"	1
said	1
a	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
not?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
No	1
one	1
replied	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
crowd,	1
found	1
that	1
every	1
eye	1
she	1
met	1
now	1
was	1
immediately	1
dropped.	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
it?"	1
she	1
asked	1
again.	1
	1
No	1
one	1
answered.	1
	1
The	1
silence	1
began	1
to	1
oppress	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
someone's	1
eye.	1
	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak?"	1
she	1
inquired	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
stood	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
stick.	1
"If	1
you	1
think	1
something	1
more	1
is	1
wanted,	1
tell	1
me!	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
anything,"	1
said	1
she,	1
catching	1
his	1
eye.	1
	1
But	1
as	1
if	1
this	1
angered	1
him,	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
quite	1
low	1
and	1
muttered:	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
we	1
agree?	1
We	1
don't	1
want	1
the	1
grain."	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
we	1
give	1
up	1
everything?	1
We	1
don't	1
agree.	1
Don't	1
agree....	1
We	1
are	1
sorry	1
for	1
you,	1
but	1
we're	1
not	1
willing.	1
Go	1
away	1
yourself,	1
alone..."	1
came	1
from	1
various	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
And	1
again	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
in	1
that	1
crowd	1
bore	1
an	1
identical	1
expression,	1
though	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
not	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
curiosity	1
or	1
gratitude,	1
but	1
of	1
angry	1
resolve.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
can't	1
have	1
understood	1
me,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
smile.	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
go?	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
house	1
and	1
feed	1
you,	1
while	1
here	1
the	1
enemy	1
would	1
ruin	1
you..."	1
	1
But	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
drowned	1
by	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
"We're	1
not	1
willing.	1
Let	1
them	1
ruin	1
us!	1
We	1
won't	1
take	1
your	1
grain.	1
We	1
don't	1
agree."	1
	1
Again	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
someone's	1
eye,	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
eye	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
her;	1
evidently	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
her	1
look.	1
She	1
felt	1
strange	1
and	1
awkward.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
an	1
artful	1
tale!	1
Follow	1
her	1
into	1
slavery!	1
Pull	1
down	1
your	1
houses	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
bondage!	1
I	1
dare	1
say!	1
'I'll	1
give	1
you	1
grain,	1
indeed!'	1
she	1
says,"	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
were	1
heard	1
saying.	1
	1
With	1
drooping	1
head	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
left	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
Having	1
repeated	1
her	1
order	1
to	1
Dron	1
to	1
have	1
horses	1
ready	1
for	1
her	1
departure	1
next	1
morning,	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
remained	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
that	1
night	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
open	1
window	1
of	1
her	1
room	1
hearing	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
peasants'	1
voices	1
that	1
reached	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
village,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
them	1
she	1
was	1
thinking.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
however	1
much	1
she	1
might	1
think	1
about	1
them.	1
She	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
one	1
thing,	1
her	1
sorrow,	1
which,	1
after	1
the	1
break	1
caused	1
by	1
cares	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
seemed	1
already	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
past.	1
Now	1
she	1
could	1
remember	1
it	1
and	1
weep	1
or	1
pray.	1
	1
After	1
sunset	1
the	1
wind	1
had	1
dropped.	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
calm	1
and	1
fresh.	1
Toward	1
midnight	1
the	1
voices	1
began	1
to	1
subside,	1
a	1
cock	1
crowed,	1
the	1
full	1
moon	1
began	1
to	1
show	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
lime	1
trees,	1
a	1
fresh	1
white	1
dewy	1
mist	1
began	1
to	1
rise,	1
and	1
stillness	1
reigned	1
over	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
Pictures	1
of	1
the	1
near	1
past--her	1
father's	1
illness	1
and	1
last	1
moments--rose	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
to	1
her	1
memory.	1
With	1
mournful	1
pleasure	1
she	1
now	1
lingered	1
over	1
these	1
images,	1
repelling	1
with	1
horror	1
only	1
the	1
last	1
one,	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
which	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
contemplate	1
even	1
in	1
imagination	1
at	1
this	1
still	1
and	1
mystic	1
hour	1
of	1
night.	1
And	1
these	1
pictures	1
presented	1
themselves	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
clearly	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
detail	1
that	1
they	1
seemed	1
now	1
present,	1
now	1
past,	1
and	1
now	1
future.	1
	1
She	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
first	1
stroke	1
and	1
was	1
being	1
dragged	1
along	1
by	1
his	1
armpits	1
through	1
the	1
garden	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
muttering	1
something	1
with	1
his	1
helpless	1
tongue,	1
twitching	1
his	1
gray	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
looking	1
uneasily	1
and	1
timidly	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
"Even	1
then	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
died,"	1
she	1
thought.	1
"He	1
had	1
always	1
thought	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
then."	1
And	1
she	1
recalled	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
detail	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
last	1
stroke,	1
when	1
with	1
a	1
foreboding	1
of	1
disaster	1
she	1
had	1
remained	1
at	1
home	1
against	1
his	1
will.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
slept	1
and	1
had	1
stolen	1
downstairs	1
on	1
tiptoe,	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
conservatory	1
where	1
he	1
slept	1
that	1
night	1
had	1
listened	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
In	1
a	1
suffering	1
and	1
weary	1
voice	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
Tikhon,	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
Crimea	1
and	1
its	1
warm	1
nights	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Empress.	1
Evidently	1
he	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk.	1
"And	1
why	1
didn't	1
he	1
call	1
me?	1
Why	1
didn't	1
he	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
there	1
instead	1
of	1
Tikhon?"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
thought	1
and	1
thought	1
again	1
now.	1
"Now	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
tell	1
anyone	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
Never	1
will	1
that	1
moment	1
return	1
for	1
him	1
or	1
for	1
me	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
all	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
not	1
Tikhon	1
but	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
heard	1
and	1
understood	1
him.	1
Why	1
didn't	1
I	1
enter	1
the	1
room?"	1
she	1
thought.	1
"Perhaps	1
he	1
would	1
then	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
died.	1
While	1
talking	1
to	1
Tikhon	1
he	1
asked	1
about	1
me	1
twice.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
standing	1
close	1
by,	1
outside	1
the	1
door.	1
It	1
was	1
sad	1
and	1
painful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
Tikhon	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him.	1
I	1
remember	1
how	1
he	1
began	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
Lise	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
alive--he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
she	1
was	1
dead--and	1
Tikhon	1
reminded	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
he	1
shouted,	1
'Fool!'	1
He	1
was	1
greatly	1
depressed.	1
From	1
behind	1
the	1
door	1
I	1
heard	1
how	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
groaning	1
and	1
loudly	1
exclaimed,	1
'My	1
God!'	1
Why	1
didn't	1
I	1
go	1
in	1
then?	1
What	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
me?	1
What	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
lost?	1
And	1
perhaps	1
he	1
would	1
then	1
have	1
been	1
comforted	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
word	1
to	1
me."	1
And	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
uttered	1
aloud	1
the	1
caressing	1
word	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death.	1
"Dear-est!"	1
she	1
repeated,	1
and	1
began	1
sobbing,	1
with	1
tears	1
that	1
relieved	1
her	1
soul.	1
She	1
now	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
before	1
her.	1
And	1
not	1
the	1
face	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
ever	1
since	1
she	1
could	1
remember	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
seen	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
but	1
the	1
timid,	1
feeble	1
face	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
quite	1
closely,	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
wrinkles	1
and	1
details,	1
when	1
she	1
stooped	1
near	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
catch	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Dear-est!"	1
she	1
repeated	1
again.	1
	1
"What	1
was	1
he	1
thinking	1
when	1
he	1
uttered	1
that	1
word?	1
What	1
is	1
he	1
thinking	1
now?"	1
This	1
question	1
suddenly	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
in	1
answer	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
before	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
in	1
his	1
coffin	1
with	1
his	1
chin	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
handkerchief.	1
And	1
the	1
horror	1
that	1
had	1
seized	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
touched	1
him	1
and	1
convinced	1
herself	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
he,	1
but	1
something	1
mysterious	1
and	1
horrible,	1
seized	1
her	1
again.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
something	1
else	1
and	1
to	1
pray,	1
but	1
could	1
do	1
neither.	1
With	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
she	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
moonlight	1
and	1
the	1
shadows,	1
expecting	1
every	1
moment	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
dead	1
face,	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
silence	1
brooding	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
within	1
it	1
held	1
her	1
fast.	1
	1
"Dunyasha,"	1
she	1
whispered.	1
"Dunyasha!"	1
she	1
screamed	1
wildly,	1
and	1
tearing	1
herself	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
silence	1
she	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
servants'	1
quarters	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
old	1
nurse	1
and	1
the	1
maidservants	1
who	1
came	1
running	1
toward	1
her.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
On	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
of	1
August	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Ilyin,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
Lavrushka	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
captivity	1
and	1
by	1
an	1
hussar	1
orderly,	1
left	1
their	1
quarters	1
at	1
Yankovo,	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
Bogucharovo,	1
and	1
went	1
for	1
a	1
ride--to	1
try	1
a	1
new	1
horse	1
Ilyin	1
had	1
bought	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
hay	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
villages.	1
	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
three	1
days	1
Bogucharovo	1
had	1
lain	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
hostile	1
armies,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
easy	1
for	1
the	1
Russian	1
rearguard	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
vanguard;	1
Rostov,	1
as	1
a	1
careful	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
such	1
provisions	1
as	1
remained	1
at	1
Bogucharovo	1
before	1
the	1
French	1
could	1
get	1
them.	1
	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Ilyin	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
merriest	1
of	1
moods.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Bogucharovo,	1
a	1
princely	1
estate	1
with	1
a	1
dwelling	1
house	1
and	1
farm	1
where	1
they	1
hoped	1
to	1
find	1
many	1
domestic	1
serfs	1
and	1
pretty	1
girls,	1
they	1
questioned	1
Lavrushka	1
about	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
his	1
stories,	1
and	1
raced	1
one	1
another	1
to	1
try	1
Ilyin's	1
horse.	1
	1
Rostov	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
village	1
he	1
was	1
entering	1
was	1
the	1
property	1
of	1
that	1
very	1
Bolkonski	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
engaged	1
to	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Ilyin	1
gave	1
rein	1
to	1
their	1
horses	1
for	1
a	1
last	1
race	1
along	1
the	1
incline	1
before	1
reaching	1
Bogucharovo,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
outstripping	1
Ilyin,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
gallop	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
street.	1
	1
"You're	1
first!"	1
cried	1
Ilyin,	1
flushed.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
always	1
first	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
grassland	1
and	1
here,"	1
answered	1
Rostov,	1
stroking	1
his	1
heated	1
Donets	1
horse.	1
	1
"And	1
I'd	1
have	1
won	1
on	1
my	1
Frenchy,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
Lavrushka	1
from	1
behind,	1
alluding	1
to	1
his	1
shabby	1
cart	1
horse,	1
"only	1
I	1
didn't	1
wish	1
to	1
mortify	1
you."	1
	1
They	1
rode	1
at	1
a	1
footpace	1
to	1
the	1
barn,	1
where	1
a	1
large	1
crowd	1
of	1
peasants	1
was	1
standing.	1
	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
bared	1
their	1
heads,	1
others	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
arrivals	1
without	1
doffing	1
their	1
caps.	1
Two	1
tall	1
old	1
peasants	1
with	1
wrinkled	1
faces	1
and	1
scanty	1
beards	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
tavern,	1
smiling,	1
staggering,	1
and	1
singing	1
some	1
incoherent	1
song,	1
and	1
approached	1
the	1
officers.	1
	1
"Fine	1
fellows!"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
laughing.	1
"Is	1
there	1
any	1
hay	1
here?"	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
like	1
one	1
another,"	1
said	1
Ilyin.	1
	1
"A	1
mo-o-st	1
me-r-r-y	1
co-o-m-pa...!"	1
sang	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
with	1
a	1
blissful	1
smile.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Who	1
do	1
you	1
belong	1
to?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"The	1
French,"	1
replied	1
Ilyin	1
jestingly,	1
"and	1
here	1
is	1
Napoleon	1
himself"--	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
are	1
Russians?"	1
the	1
peasant	1
asked	1
again.	1
	1
"And	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
large	1
force	1
of	1
you	1
here?"	1
said	1
another,	1
a	1
short	1
man,	1
coming	1
up.	1
	1
"Very	1
large,"	1
answered	1
Rostov.	1
"But	1
why	1
have	1
you	1
collected	1
here?"	1
he	1
added.	1
"Is	1
it	1
a	1
holiday?"	1
	1
"The	1
old	1
men	1
have	1
met	1
to	1
talk	1
over	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
commune,"	1
replied	1
the	1
peasant,	1
moving	1
away.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
leading	1
from	1
the	1
big	1
house,	1
two	1
women	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
hat	1
were	1
seen	1
coming	1
toward	1
the	1
officers.	1
	1
"The	1
one	1
in	1
pink	1
is	1
mine,	1
so	1
keep	1
off!"	1
said	1
Ilyin	1
on	1
seeing	1
Dunyasha	1
running	1
resolutely	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
"She'll	1
be	1
ours!"	1
said	1
Lavrushka	1
to	1
Ilyin,	1
winking.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
my	1
pretty?"	1
said	1
Ilyin	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"The	1
princess	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
your	1
regiment	1
and	1
your	1
name."	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
Count	1
Rostov,	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
humble	1
servant."	1
	1
"Co-o-om-pa-ny!"	1
roared	1
the	1
tipsy	1
peasant	1
with	1
a	1
beatific	1
smile	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Ilyin	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
girl.	1
Following	1
Dunyasha,	1
Alpatych	1
advanced	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
having	1
bared	1
his	1
head	1
while	1
still	1
at	1
a	1
distance.	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
trouble	1
your	1
honor?"	1
said	1
he	1
respectfully,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
youthfulness	1
of	1
this	1
officer	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
hand	1
thrust	1
into	1
his	1
bosom.	1
"My	1
mistress,	1
daughter	1
of	1
General	1
in	1
Chief	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
who	1
died	1
on	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
of	1
this	1
month,	1
finding	1
herself	1
in	1
difficulties	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
boorishness	1
of	1
these	1
people"--he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
peasants--"asks	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house....	1
Won't	1
you,	1
please,	1
ride	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
farther,"	1
said	1
Alpatych	1
with	1
a	1
melancholy	1
smile,	1
"as	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
convenient	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of...?"	1
He	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
peasants	1
who	1
kept	1
as	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
horseflies	1
to	1
a	1
horse.	1
	1
"Ah!...	1
Alpatych...	1
Ah,	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych...	1
Grand!	1
Forgive	1
us	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
the	1
peasants,	1
smiling	1
joyfully	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
tipsy	1
peasants	1
and	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Or	1
perhaps	1
they	1
amuse	1
your	1
honor?"	1
remarked	1
Alpatych	1
with	1
a	1
staid	1
air,	1
as	1
he	1
pointed	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
with	1
his	1
free	1
hand.	1
	1
"No,	1
there's	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
amused	1
at	1
here,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
rode	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
way.	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
inform	1
your	1
honor	1
that	1
the	1
rude	1
peasants	1
here	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
mistress	1
leave	1
the	1
estate,	1
and	1
threaten	1
to	1
unharness	1
her	1
horses,	1
so	1
that	1
though	1
everything	1
has	1
been	1
packed	1
up	1
since	1
morning,	1
her	1
excellency	1
cannot	1
get	1
away."	1
	1
"Impossible!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
report	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
actual	1
truth,"	1
said	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
Rostov	1
dismounted,	1
gave	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
the	1
orderly,	1
and	1
followed	1
Alpatych	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
questioning	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
affairs.	1
It	1
appeared	1
that	1
the	1
princess'	1
offer	1
of	1
corn	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
the	1
previous	1
day,	1
and	1
her	1
talk	1
with	1
Dron	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
meeting,	1
had	1
actually	1
had	1
so	1
bad	1
an	1
effect	1
that	1
Dron	1
had	1
finally	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
keys	1
and	1
joined	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
appeared	1
when	1
Alpatych	1
sent	1
for	1
him;	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
when	1
the	1
princess	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
harness	1
for	1
her	1
journey,	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
crowd	1
to	1
the	1
barn	1
and	1
sent	1
word	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
leave	1
the	1
village:	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
move,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
unharness	1
the	1
horses.	1
Alpatych	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
admonish	1
them,	1
but	1
was	1
told	1
(it	1
was	1
chiefly	1
Karp	1
who	1
did	1
the	1
talking,	1
Dron	1
not	1
showing	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
crowd)	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
princess	1
go,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
the	1
contrary,	1
but	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
stayed	1
they	1
would	1
serve	1
her	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
obey	1
her	1
in	1
everything.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Ilyin	1
were	1
galloping	1
along	1
the	1
road,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
despite	1
the	1
dissuasions	1
of	1
Alpatych,	1
her	1
nurse,	1
and	1
the	1
maids,	1
had	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
harness	1
and	1
intended	1
to	1
start,	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
cavalrymen	1
were	1
espied	1
they	1
were	1
taken	1
for	1
Frenchmen,	1
the	1
coachman	1
ran	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
began	1
to	1
wail.	1
	1
"Father!	1
Benefactor!	1
God	1
has	1
sent	1
you!"	1
exclaimed	1
deeply	1
moved	1
voices	1
as	1
Rostov	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
sitting	1
helpless	1
and	1
bewildered	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
sitting	1
room,	1
when	1
Rostov	1
was	1
shown	1
in.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
grasp	1
who	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
come,	1
or	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
to	1
her.	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
Russian	1
face,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
walk	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
he	1
uttered	1
recognized	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
class,	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
deep	1
radiant	1
look	1
and	1
began	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
faltered	1
and	1
trembled	1
with	1
emotion.	1
This	1
meeting	1
immediately	1
struck	1
Rostov	1
as	1
a	1
romantic	1
event.	1
"A	1
helpless	1
girl	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
grief,	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
coarse,	1
rioting	1
peasants!	1
And	1
what	1
a	1
strange	1
fate	1
sent	1
me	1
here!	1
What	1
gentleness	1
and	1
nobility	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
her	1
features	1
and	1
expression!"	1
thought	1
he	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
timid	1
story.	1
	1
When	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
happened	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
her	1
father's	1
funeral,	1
her	1
voice	1
trembled.	1
She	1
turned	1
away,	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
if	1
fearing	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
her	1
words	1
as	1
meant	1
to	1
move	1
him	1
to	1
pity,	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
apprehensive	1
glance	1
of	1
inquiry.	1
There	1
were	1
tears	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
eyes.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
noticed	1
this	1
and	1
glanced	1
gratefully	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
that	1
radiant	1
look	1
which	1
caused	1
the	1
plainness	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
express,	1
Princess,	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
ride	1
here	1
and	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
show	1
my	1
readiness	1
to	1
serve	1
you,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
rising.	1
"Go	1
when	1
you	1
please,	1
and	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
shall	1
dare	1
to	1
cause	1
you	1
annoyance	1
if	1
only	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
your	1
escort."	1
And	1
bowing	1
respectfully,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
of	1
royal	1
blood,	1
he	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Rostov's	1
deferential	1
tone	1
seemed	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
consider	1
himself	1
happy	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
her,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
her	1
misfortunes	1
to	1
intrude	1
upon	1
her.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
understood	1
this	1
and	1
appreciated	1
his	1
delicacy.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very,	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
French,	1
"but	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
misunderstanding	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it."	1
She	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Excuse	1
me!"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
knitting	1
his	1
brows,	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
another	1
low	1
bow.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
"Well,	1
is	1
she	1
pretty?	1
Ah,	1
friend--my	1
pink	1
one	1
is	1
delicious;	1
her	1
name	1
is	1
Dunyasha...."	1
	1
But	1
on	1
glancing	1
at	1
Rostov's	1
face	1
Ilyin	1
stopped	1
short.	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
hero	1
and	1
commander	1
was	1
following	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
train	1
of	1
thought.	1
	1
Rostov	1
glanced	1
angrily	1
at	1
Ilyin	1
and	1
without	1
replying	1
strode	1
off	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
village.	1
	1
"I'll	1
show	1
them;	1
I'll	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
the	1
brigands!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
Alpatych	1
at	1
a	1
gliding	1
trot,	1
only	1
just	1
managing	1
not	1
to	1
run,	1
kept	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"What	1
decision	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
come	1
to?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Rostov	1
stopped	1
and,	1
clenching	1
his	1
fists,	1
suddenly	1
and	1
sternly	1
turned	1
on	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
"Decision?	1
What	1
decision?	1
Old	1
dotard!..."	1
cried	1
he.	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
about?	1
Eh?	1
The	1
peasants	1
are	1
rioting,	1
and	1
you	1
can't	1
manage	1
them?	1
You're	1
a	1
traitor	1
yourself!	1
I	1
know	1
you.	1
I'll	1
flay	1
you	1
all	1
alive!..."	1
And	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
of	1
wasting	1
his	1
store	1
of	1
anger,	1
he	1
left	1
Alpatych	1
and	1
went	1
rapidly	1
forward.	1
Alpatych,	1
mastering	1
his	1
offended	1
feelings,	1
kept	1
pace	1
with	1
Rostov	1
at	1
a	1
gliding	1
gait	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
impart	1
his	1
views.	1
He	1
said	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
obdurate	1
and	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
imprudent	1
to	1
"overresist"	1
them	1
without	1
an	1
armed	1
force,	1
and	1
would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
better	1
first	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
military?	1
	1
"I'll	1
give	1
them	1
armed	1
force...	1
I'll	1
'overresist'	1
them!"	1
uttered	1
Rostov	1
meaninglessly,	1
breathless	1
with	1
irrational	1
animal	1
fury	1
and	1
the	1
need	1
to	1
vent	1
it.	1
	1
Without	1
considering	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
he	1
moved	1
unconciously	1
with	1
quick,	1
resolute	1
steps	1
toward	1
the	1
crowd.	1
And	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
drew	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
more	1
Alpatych	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
unreasonable	1
action	1
might	1
produce	1
good	1
results.	1
The	1
peasants	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
were	1
similarly	1
impressed	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Rostov's	1
rapid,	1
firm	1
steps	1
and	1
resolute,	1
frowning	1
face.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
hussars	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
Rostov	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
princess,	1
a	1
certain	1
confusion	1
and	1
dissension	1
had	1
arisen	1
among	1
the	1
crowd.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
said	1
that	1
these	1
new	1
arrivals	1
were	1
Russians	1
and	1
might	1
take	1
it	1
amiss	1
that	1
the	1
mistress	1
was	1
being	1
detained.	1
Dron	1
was	1
of	1
this	1
opinion,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
it	1
Karp	1
and	1
others	1
attacked	1
their	1
ex-Elder.	1
	1
"How	1
many	1
years	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
fattening	1
on	1
the	1
commune?"	1
Karp	1
shouted	1
at	1
him.	1
"It's	1
all	1
one	1
to	1
you!	1
You'll	1
dig	1
up	1
your	1
pot	1
of	1
money	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
away	1
with	1
you....	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
you	1
whether	1
our	1
homes	1
are	1
ruined	1
or	1
not?"	1
	1
"We've	1
been	1
told	1
to	1
keep	1
order,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
to	1
leave	1
their	1
homes	1
or	1
take	1
away	1
a	1
single	1
grain,	1
and	1
that's	1
all	1
about	1
it!"	1
cried	1
another.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
your	1
son's	1
turn	1
to	1
be	1
conscripted,	1
but	1
no	1
fear!	1
You	1
begrudged	1
your	1
lump	1
of	1
a	1
son,"	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
suddenly	1
began	1
attacking	1
Dron--	1
"and	1
so	1
they	1
took	1
my	1
Vanka	1
to	1
be	1
shaved	1
for	1
a	1
soldier!	1
But	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
to	1
die."	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
to	1
die.	1
I'm	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
commune,"	1
said	1
Dron.	1
	1
"That's	1
it--not	1
against	1
it!	1
You've	1
filled	1
your	1
belly...."	1
	1
The	1
two	1
tall	1
peasants	1
had	1
their	1
say.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Rostov,	1
followed	1
by	1
Ilyin,	1
Lavrushka,	1
and	1
Alpatych,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
crowd,	1
Karp,	1
thrusting	1
his	1
fingers	1
into	1
his	1
belt	1
and	1
smiling	1
a	1
little,	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
front.	1
Dron	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
retired	1
to	1
the	1
rear	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
drew	1
closer	1
together.	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
your	1
Elder	1
here?	1
Hey?"	1
shouted	1
Rostov,	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
crowd	1
with	1
quick	1
steps.	1
	1
"The	1
Elder?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
with	1
him?..."	1
asked	1
Karp.	1
	1
But	1
before	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
well	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
his	1
cap	1
flew	1
off	1
and	1
a	1
fierce	1
blow	1
jerked	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
one	1
side.	1
	1
"Caps	1
off,	1
traitors!"	1
shouted	1
Rostov	1
in	1
a	1
wrathful	1
voice.	1
"Where's	1
the	1
Elder?"	1
he	1
cried	1
furiously.	1
	1
"The	1
Elder....	1
He	1
wants	1
the	1
Elder!...	1
Dron	1
Zakharych,	1
you!"	1
meek	1
and	1
flustered	1
voices	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
heard	1
calling	1
and	1
caps	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
off	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
"We	1
don't	1
riot,	1
we're	1
following	1
the	1
orders,"	1
declared	1
Karp,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
several	1
voices	1
began	1
speaking	1
together.	1
	1
"It's	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
have	1
decided--there's	1
too	1
many	1
of	1
you	1
giving	1
orders."	1
	1
"Arguing?	1
Mutiny!...	1
Brigands!	1
Traitors!"	1
cried	1
Rostov	1
unmeaningly	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
not	1
his	1
own,	1
gripping	1
Karp	1
by	1
the	1
collar.	1
"Bind	1
him,	1
bind	1
him!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
bind	1
him	1
but	1
Lavrushka	1
and	1
Alpatych.	1
	1
Lavrushka,	1
however,	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
Karp	1
and	1
seized	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arms	1
from	1
behind.	1
	1
"Shall	1
I	1
call	1
up	1
our	1
men	1
from	1
beyond	1
the	1
hill?"	1
he	1
called	1
out.	1
	1
Alpatych	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
ordered	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
name	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
bind	1
Karp.	1
The	1
men	1
obediently	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
began	1
taking	1
off	1
their	1
belts.	1
	1
"Where's	1
the	1
Elder?"	1
demanded	1
Rostov	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
pale	1
and	1
frowning	1
face	1
Dron	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
the	1
Elder?	1
Bind	1
him,	1
Lavrushka!"	1
shouted	1
Rostov,	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
order,	1
too,	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
meet	1
with	1
any	1
opposition.	1
	1
And	1
in	1
fact	1
two	1
more	1
peasants	1
began	1
binding	1
Dron,	1
who	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
own	1
belt	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
aid	1
them.	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
all	1
listen	1
to	1
me!"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
to	1
the	1
peasants.	1
"Be	1
off	1
to	1
your	1
houses	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
don't	1
let	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
voices	1
be	1
heard!"	1
	1
"Why,	1
we've	1
not	1
done	1
any	1
harm!	1
We	1
did	1
it	1
just	1
out	1
of	1
foolishness.	1
It's	1
all	1
nonsense...	1
I	1
said	1
then	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
order,"	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
bickering	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
	1
"There!	1
What	1
did	1
I	1
say?"	1
said	1
Alpatych,	1
coming	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
again.	1
"It's	1
wrong,	1
lads!"	1
	1
"All	1
our	1
stupidity,	1
Yakov	1
Alpatych,"	1
came	1
the	1
answers,	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
began	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
disperse	1
through	1
the	1
village.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
bound	1
men	1
were	1
led	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
master's	1
house.	1
The	1
two	1
drunken	1
peasants	1
followed	1
them.	1
	1
"Aye,	1
when	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
you!..."	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
Karp.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
one	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
masters	1
like	1
that?	1
What	1
were	1
you	1
thinking	1
of,	1
you	1
fool?"	1
added	1
the	1
other--"A	1
real	1
fool!"	1
	1
Two	1
hours	1
later	1
the	1
carts	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
Bogucharovo	1
house.	1
The	1
peasants	1
were	1
briskly	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
proprietor's	1
goods	1
and	1
packing	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
carts,	1
and	1
Dron,	1
liberated	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
wish	1
from	1
the	1
cupboard	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
confined,	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
directing	1
the	1
men.	1
	1
"Don't	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
so	1
carelessly,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
peasants,	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
round	1
smiling	1
face,	1
taking	1
a	1
casket	1
from	1
a	1
housemaid.	1
"You	1
know	1
it	1
has	1
cost	1
money!	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
chuck	1
it	1
in	1
like	1
that	1
or	1
shove	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
cord	1
where	1
it'll	1
get	1
rubbed?	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
that	1
way	1
of	1
doing	1
things.	1
Let	1
it	1
all	1
be	1
done	1
properly,	1
according	1
to	1
rule.	1
Look	1
here,	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
bast	1
matting	1
and	1
cover	1
it	1
with	1
hay--that's	1
the	1
way!"	1
	1
"Eh,	1
books,	1
books!"	1
said	1
another	1
peasant,	1
bringing	1
out	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
library	1
cupboards.	1
"Don't	1
catch	1
up	1
against	1
it!	1
It's	1
heavy,	1
lads--solid	1
books."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
worked	1
all	1
day	1
and	1
didn't	1
play!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
tall,	1
round-	1
faced	1
peasant	1
gravely,	1
pointing	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
wink	1
at	1
the	1
dictionaries	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
top.	1
	1
Unwilling	1
to	1
obtrude	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
princess,	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
awaiting	1
her	1
departure.	1
When	1
her	1
carriage	1
drove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
mounted	1
and	1
accompanied	1
her	1
eight	1
miles	1
from	1
Bogucharovo	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
our	1
troops.	1
At	1
the	1
inn	1
at	1
Yankovo	1
he	1
respectfully	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
her,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
permitting	1
himself	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
speak	1
so!"	1
he	1
blushingly	1
replied	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
expressions	1
of	1
gratitude	1
for	1
her	1
deliverance,	1
as	1
she	1
termed	1
what	1
had	1
occurred.	1
"Any	1
police	1
officer	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
as	1
much!	1
If	1
we	1
had	1
had	1
only	1
peasants	1
to	1
fight,	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
let	1
the	1
enemy	1
come	1
so	1
far,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
wishing	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject.	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
making	1
your	1
acquaintance.	1
Good-bye,	1
Princess.	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
happiness	1
and	1
consolation	1
and	1
hope	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
again	1
in	1
happier	1
circumstances.	1
If	1
you	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
blush,	1
please	1
don't	1
thank	1
me!"	1
	1
But	1
the	1
princess,	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
again	1
thank	1
him	1
in	1
words,	1
thanked	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face,	1
radiant	1
with	1
gratitude	1
and	1
tenderness.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
thank	1
him	1
for.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
certain	1
that	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
there	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
perished	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
mutineers	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
exposed	1
himself	1
to	1
terrible	1
and	1
obvious	1
danger	1
to	1
save	1
her,	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
certain	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
lofty	1
and	1
noble	1
soul,	1
able	1
to	1
understand	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
her	1
sorrow.	1
His	1
kind,	1
honest	1
eyes,	1
with	1
the	1
tears	1
rising	1
in	1
them	1
when	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
cry	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
her	1
loss,	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
memory.	1
	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
leave	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
remained	1
alone	1
she	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
her	1
eyes	1
filling	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
then	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
strange	1
question	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
her:	1
did	1
she	1
love	1
him?	1
	1
On	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
though	1
the	1
princess'	1
position	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
cheerful	1
one,	1
Dunyasha,	1
who	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
noticed	1
that	1
her	1
mistress	1
leaned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
smiled	1
at	1
something	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
mingled	1
joy	1
and	1
sorrow.	1
	1
"Well,	1
supposing	1
I	1
do	1
love	1
him?"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Ashamed	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
acknowledging	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
would	1
perhaps	1
never	1
love	1
her,	1
she	1
comforted	1
herself	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
ever	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
blame	1
if,	1
without	1
ever	1
speaking	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
anyone,	1
she	1
continued	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
last	1
time	1
in	1
her	1
life.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
when	1
she	1
recalled	1
his	1
looks,	1
his	1
sympathy,	1
and	1
his	1
words,	1
happiness	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
impossible	1
to	1
her.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
those	1
moments	1
that	1
Dunyasha	1
noticed	1
her	1
smiling	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
window.	1
	1
"Was	1
it	1
not	1
fate	1
that	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Bogucharovo,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment?"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"And	1
that	1
caused	1
his	1
sister	1
to	1
refuse	1
my	1
brother?"	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
saw	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Providence.	1
	1
The	1
impression	1
the	1
princess	1
made	1
on	1
Rostov	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
one.	1
To	1
remember	1
her	1
gave	1
him	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
comrades,	1
hearing	1
of	1
his	1
adventure	1
at	1
Bogucharovo,	1
rallied	1
him	1
on	1
having	1
gone	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
hay	1
and	1
having	1
picked	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wealthiest	1
heiresses	1
in	1
Russia,	1
he	1
grew	1
angry.	1
It	1
made	1
him	1
angry	1
just	1
because	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
marrying	1
the	1
gentle	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
was	1
attractive	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
enormous	1
fortune,	1
had	1
against	1
his	1
will	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
entered	1
his	1
head.	1
For	1
himself	1
personally	1
Nicholas	1
could	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
wife:	1
by	1
marrying	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
countess	1
his	1
mother	1
happy,	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
father's	1
affairs	1
in	1
order,	1
and	1
would	1
even--he	1
felt	1
it--ensure	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
happiness.	1
	1
But	1
Sonya?	1
And	1
his	1
plighted	1
word?	1
That	1
was	1
why	1
Rostov	1
grew	1
angry	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
rallied	1
about	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya.	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
On	1
receiving	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
Kutuzov	1
remembered	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
sent	1
an	1
order	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
report	1
at	1
headquarters.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
arrived	1
at	1
Tsarevo-Zaymishche	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
hour	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
reviewing	1
the	1
troops	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
He	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
at	1
the	1
priest's	1
house	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
which	1
stood	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
carriage,	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
awaiting	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness,	1
as	1
everyone	1
now	1
called	1
Kutuzov.	1
From	1
the	1
field	1
beyond	1
the	1
village	1
came	1
now	1
sounds	1
of	1
regimental	1
music	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
many	1
voices	1
shouting	1
"Hurrah!"	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
commander-in-chief.	1
Two	1
orderlies,	1
a	1
courier	1
and	1
a	1
major-domo,	1
stood	1
near	1
by,	1
some	1
ten	1
paces	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
availing	1
themselves	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
absence	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fine	1
weather.	1
A	1
short,	1
swarthy	1
lieutenant	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars	1
with	1
thick	1
mustaches	1
and	1
whiskers	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
and,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
inquired	1
whether	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
was	1
putting	1
up	1
there	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
back.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
on	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness'	1
staff	1
but	1
was	1
himself	1
a	1
new	1
arrival.	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
colonel	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
smart	1
orderly,	1
who,	1
with	1
the	1
peculiar	1
contempt	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
commander-in-	1
chief's	1
orderly	1
speaks	1
to	1
officers,	1
replied:	1
	1
"What?	1
His	1
Serene	1
Highness?	1
I	1
expect	1
he'll	1
be	1
here	1
soon.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars	1
smiled	1
beneath	1
his	1
mustache	1
at	1
the	1
orderly's	1
tone,	1
dismounted,	1
gave	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
a	1
dispatch	1
runner,	1
and	1
approached	1
Bolkonski	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
bow.	1
Bolkonski	1
made	1
room	1
for	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
and	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
colonel	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"You're	1
also	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
commander-in-chief?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"They	1
say	1
he	1
weceives	1
evewyone,	1
thank	1
God!...	1
It's	1
awful	1
with	1
those	1
sausage	1
eaters!	1
Ermolov	1
had	1
weason	1
to	1
ask	1
to	1
be	1
pwomoted	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
German!	1
Now	1
p'waps	1
Wussians	1
will	1
get	1
a	1
look	1
in.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
devil	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
was	1
happening.	1
We	1
kept	1
wetweating	1
and	1
wetweating.	1
Did	1
you	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
campaign?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"not	1
only	1
of	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
retreat	1
but	1
of	1
losing	1
in	1
that	1
retreat	1
all	1
I	1
held	1
dear--not	1
to	1
mention	1
the	1
estate	1
and	1
home	1
of	1
my	1
birth--my	1
father,	1
who	1
died	1
of	1
grief.	1
I	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Smolensk."	1
	1
"Ah?	1
You're	1
Pwince	1
Bolkonski?	1
Vewy	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
acquaintance!	1
I'm	1
Lieutenant	1
Colonel	1
Denisov,	1
better	1
known	1
as	1
'Vaska,'"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
pressing	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
hand	1
and	1
looking	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
particularly	1
kindly	1
attention.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
heard,"	1
said	1
he	1
sympathetically,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
added:	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
Scythian	1
warfare.	1
It's	1
all	1
vewy	1
well--only	1
not	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
get	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
neck.	1
So	1
you	1
are	1
Pwince	1
Andwew	1
Bolkonski?"	1
He	1
swayed	1
his	1
head.	1
"Vewy	1
pleased,	1
Pwince,	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
acquaintance!"	1
he	1
repeated	1
again,	1
smiling	1
sadly,	1
and	1
he	1
again	1
pressed	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
hand.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
knew	1
Denisov	1
from	1
what	1
Natasha	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
first	1
suitor.	1
This	1
memory	1
carried	1
him	1
sadly	1
and	1
sweetly	1
back	1
to	1
those	1
painful	1
feelings	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
lately,	1
but	1
which	1
still	1
found	1
place	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
Of	1
late	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
so	1
many	1
new	1
and	1
very	1
serious	1
impressions--such	1
as	1
the	1
retreat	1
from	1
Smolensk,	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
and	1
the	1
recent	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
death--and	1
had	1
experienced	1
so	1
many	1
emotions,	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
past	1
those	1
memories	1
had	1
not	1
entered	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
did,	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
act	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
nearly	1
their	1
former	1
strength.	1
For	1
Denisov,	1
too,	1
the	1
memories	1
awakened	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Bolkonski	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
distant,	1
romantic	1
past,	1
when	1
after	1
supper	1
and	1
after	1
Natasha's	1
singing	1
he	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
of	1
fifteen	1
without	1
realizing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing.	1
He	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
passed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
what	1
now	1
interested	1
him	1
passionately	1
and	1
exclusively.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign	1
he	1
had	1
devised	1
while	1
serving	1
at	1
the	1
outposts	1
during	1
the	1
retreat.	1
He	1
had	1
proposed	1
that	1
plan	1
to	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly	1
and	1
now	1
wished	1
to	1
propose	1
it	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
The	1
plan	1
was	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
line	1
of	1
operation	1
was	1
too	1
extended,	1
and	1
it	1
proposed	1
that	1
instead	1
of,	1
or	1
concurrently	1
with,	1
action	1
on	1
the	1
front	1
to	1
bar	1
the	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
we	1
should	1
attack	1
their	1
line	1
of	1
communication.	1
He	1
began	1
explaining	1
his	1
plan	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"They	1
can't	1
hold	1
all	1
that	1
line.	1
It's	1
impossible.	1
I	1
will	1
undertake	1
to	1
bweak	1
thwough.	1
Give	1
me	1
five	1
hundwed	1
men	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bweak	1
the	1
line,	1
that's	1
certain!	1
There's	1
only	1
one	1
way--guewilla	1
warfare!"	1
	1
Denisov	1
rose	1
and	1
began	1
gesticulating	1
as	1
he	1
explained	1
his	1
plan	1
to	1
Bolkonski.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
explanation	1
shouts	1
were	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
army,	1
growing	1
more	1
incoherent	1
and	1
more	1
diffused,	1
mingling	1
with	1
music	1
and	1
songs	1
and	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
where	1
the	1
review	1
was	1
held.	1
Sounds	1
of	1
hoofs	1
and	1
shouts	1
were	1
nearing	1
the	1
village.	1
	1
"He's	1
coming!	1
He's	1
coming!"	1
shouted	1
a	1
Cossack	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
Bolkonski	1
and	1
Denisov	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
gate,	1
at	1
which	1
a	1
knot	1
of	1
soldiers	1
(a	1
guard	1
of	1
honor)	1
was	1
standing,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
Kutuzov	1
coming	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
rather	1
small	1
sorrel	1
horse.	1
A	1
huge	1
suite	1
of	1
generals	1
rode	1
behind	1
him.	1
Barclay	1
was	1
riding	1
almost	1
beside	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
officers	1
ran	1
after	1
and	1
around	1
them	1
shouting,	1
"Hurrah!"	1
	1
His	1
adjutants	1
galloped	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
before	1
him.	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
impatiently	1
urging	1
on	1
his	1
horse,	1
which	1
ambled	1
smoothly	1
under	1
his	1
weight,	1
and	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
white	1
Horse	1
Guard's	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
band	1
and	1
no	1
peak,	1
nodding	1
his	1
head	1
continually.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
guard	1
of	1
honor,	1
a	1
fine	1
set	1
of	1
Grenadiers	1
mostly	1
wearing	1
decorations,	1
who	1
were	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
salute,	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
silently	1
and	1
attentively	1
for	1
nearly	1
a	1
minute	1
with	1
the	1
steady	1
gaze	1
of	1
a	1
commander	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
generals	1
and	1
officers	1
surrounding	1
him.	1
Suddenly	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
subtle	1
expression,	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
perplexity.	1
	1
"And	1
with	1
such	1
fine	1
fellows	1
to	1
retreat	1
and	1
retreat!	1
Well,	1
good-by,	1
General,"	1
he	1
added,	1
and	1
rode	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
past	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Hurrah!	1
hurrah!	1
hurrah!"	1
shouted	1
those	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
Since	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
last	1
seen	1
him	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
grown	1
still	1
more	1
corpulent,	1
flaccid,	1
and	1
fat.	1
But	1
the	1
bleached	1
eyeball,	1
the	1
scar,	1
and	1
the	1
familiar	1
weariness	1
of	1
his	1
expression	1
were	1
still	1
the	1
same.	1
He	1
was	1
wearing	1
the	1
white	1
Horse	1
Guard's	1
cap	1
and	1
a	1
military	1
overcoat	1
with	1
a	1
whip	1
hanging	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
by	1
a	1
thin	1
strap.	1
He	1
sat	1
heavily	1
and	1
swayed	1
limply	1
on	1
his	1
brisk	1
little	1
horse.	1
	1
"Whew...	1
whew...	1
whew!"	1
he	1
whistled	1
just	1
audibly	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
into	1
the	1
yard.	1
His	1
face	1
expressed	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
relaxed	1
strain	1
felt	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
means	1
to	1
rest	1
after	1
a	1
ceremony.	1
He	1
drew	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stirrup	1
and,	1
lurching	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
and	1
puckering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
effort,	1
raised	1
it	1
with	1
difficulty	1
onto	1
the	1
saddle,	1
leaned	1
on	1
his	1
knee,	1
groaned,	1
and	1
slipped	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
adjutants	1
who	1
stood	1
ready	1
to	1
assist	1
him.	1
	1
He	1
pulled	1
himself	1
together,	1
looked	1
round,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
glanced	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and,	1
evidently	1
not	1
recognizing	1
him,	1
moved	1
with	1
his	1
waddling	1
gait	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
"Whew...	1
whew...	1
whew!"	1
he	1
whistled,	1
and	1
again	1
glanced	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
As	1
often	1
occurs	1
with	1
old	1
men,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
after	1
some	1
seconds	1
that	1
the	1
impression	1
produced	1
by	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
linked	1
itself	1
up	1
with	1
Kutuzov's	1
remembrance	1
of	1
his	1
personality.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
my	1
dear	1
prince?	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy?	1
Come	1
along..."	1
said	1
he,	1
glancing	1
wearily	1
round,	1
and	1
he	1
stepped	1
onto	1
the	1
porch	1
which	1
creaked	1
under	1
his	1
weight.	1
	1
He	1
unbuttoned	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
in	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
"And	1
how's	1
your	1
father?"	1
	1
"I	1
received	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
yesterday,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
abruptly.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
wide	1
open	1
with	1
dismay	1
and	1
then	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
crossed	1
himself:	1
	1
"May	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Heaven	1
be	1
his!	1
God's	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
us	1
all!"	1
He	1
sighed	1
deeply,	1
his	1
whole	1
chest	1
heaving,	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
"I	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1
respected	1
him,	1
and	1
sympathize	1
with	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart."	1
	1
He	1
embraced	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
pressing	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
fat	1
breast,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
When	1
he	1
released	1
him	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
that	1
Kutuzov's	1
flabby	1
lips	1
were	1
trembling	1
and	1
that	1
tears	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
He	1
sighed	1
and	1
pressed	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
to	1
raise	1
himself.	1
	1
"Come!	1
Come	1
with	1
me,	1
we'll	1
have	1
a	1
talk,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Denisov,	1
no	1
more	1
intimidated	1
by	1
his	1
superiors	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
enemy,	1
came	1
with	1
jingling	1
spurs	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
porch,	1
despite	1
the	1
angry	1
whispers	1
of	1
the	1
adjutants	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
stop	1
him.	1
Kutuzov,	1
his	1
hands	1
still	1
pressed	1
on	1
the	1
seat,	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
glumly.	1
Denisov,	1
having	1
given	1
his	1
name,	1
announced	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
for	1
their	1
country's	1
welfare.	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
wearily	1
at	1
him	1
and,	1
lifting	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
annoyance,	1
folded	1
them	1
across	1
his	1
stomach,	1
repeating	1
the	1
words:	1
"For	1
our	1
country's	1
welfare?	1
Well,	1
what	1
is	1
it?	1
Speak!"	1
Denisov	1
blushed	1
like	1
a	1
girl	1
(it	1
was	1
strange	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
color	1
rise	1
in	1
that	1
shaggy,	1
bibulous,	1
time-	1
worn	1
face)	1
and	1
boldly	1
began	1
to	1
expound	1
his	1
plan	1
of	1
cutting	1
the	1
enemy's	1
lines	1
of	1
communication	1
between	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
Vyazma.	1
Denisov	1
came	1
from	1
those	1
parts	1
and	1
knew	1
the	1
country	1
well.	1
His	1
plan	1
seemed	1
decidedly	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
especially	1
from	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
conviction	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
spoke.	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
legs,	1
occasionally	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
adjoining	1
hut	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
something	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
emerge	1
from	1
it.	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
hut,	1
while	1
Denisov	1
was	1
speaking,	1
a	1
general	1
with	1
a	1
portfolio	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
really	1
did	1
appear.	1
	1
"What?"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
explanations,	1
"are	1
you	1
ready	1
so	1
soon?"	1
	1
"Ready,	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness,"	1
replied	1
the	1
general.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
swayed	1
his	1
head,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say:	1
"How	1
is	1
one	1
man	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
it	1
all?"	1
and	1
again	1
listened	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"I	1
give	1
my	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
as	1
a	1
Wussian	1
officer,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
"that	1
I	1
can	1
bweak	1
Napoleon's	1
line	1
of	1
communication!"	1
	1
"What	1
relation	1
are	1
you	1
to	1
Intendant	1
General	1
Kiril	1
Andreevich	1
Denisov?"	1
asked	1
Kutuzov,	1
interrupting	1
him.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
my	1
uncle,	1
your	1
Sewene	1
Highness."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
we	1
were	1
friends,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
cheerfully.	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,	1
friend,	1
stay	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
staff	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
we'll	1
have	1
a	1
talk."	1
	1
With	1
a	1
nod	1
to	1
Denisov	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
the	1
papers	1
Konovnitsyn	1
had	1
brought	1
him.	1
	1
"Would	1
not	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
like	1
to	1
come	1
inside?"	1
said	1
the	1
general	1
on	1
duty	1
in	1
a	1
discontented	1
voice,	1
"the	1
plans	1
must	1
be	1
examined	1
and	1
several	1
papers	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
signed."	1
	1
An	1
adjutant	1
came	1
out	1
and	1
announced	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
in	1
readiness	1
within.	1
But	1
Kutuzov	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
enter	1
that	1
room	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
disengaged.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
grimace...	1
	1
"No,	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
small	1
table	1
out	1
here,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy.	1
I'll	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
here,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Don't	1
go	1
away,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
general's	1
report.	1
	1
While	1
this	1
was	1
being	1
given,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
heard	1
the	1
whisper	1
of	1
a	1
woman's	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
a	1
silk	1
dress	1
behind	1
the	1
door.	1
Several	1
times	1
on	1
glancing	1
that	1
way	1
he	1
noticed	1
behind	1
that	1
door	1
a	1
plump,	1
rosy,	1
handsome	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
pink	1
dress	1
with	1
a	1
lilac	1
silk	1
kerchief	1
on	1
her	1
head,	1
holding	1
a	1
dish	1
and	1
evidently	1
awaiting	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
Kutuzov's	1
adjutant	1
whispered	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
whose	1
home	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
intended	1
to	1
offer	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
bread	1
and	1
salt.	1
"Her	1
husband	1
has	1
welcomed	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
with	1
the	1
cross	1
at	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
she	1
intends	1
to	1
welcome	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
house....	1
She's	1
very	1
pretty,"	1
added	1
the	1
adjutant	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
At	1
those	1
words	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
round.	1
He	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
general's	1
report--	1
which	1
consisted	1
chiefly	1
of	1
a	1
criticism	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
at	1
Tsarevo-	1
Zaymishche--as	1
he	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
seven	1
years	1
previously	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
discussion	1
at	1
the	1
Austerlitz	1
council	1
of	1
war.	1
He	1
evidently	1
listened	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
ears	1
which,	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
tow	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
hearing;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
nothing	1
the	1
general	1
could	1
say	1
would	1
surprise	1
or	1
even	1
interest	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
said	1
beforehand,	1
and	1
heard	1
it	1
all	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
to,	1
as	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
chanting	1
of	1
a	1
service	1
of	1
prayer.	1
All	1
that	1
Denisov	1
had	1
said	1
was	1
clever	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
What	1
the	1
general	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
clever	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
despised	1
knowledge	1
and	1
cleverness,	1
and	1
knew	1
of	1
something	1
else	1
that	1
would	1
decide	1
the	1
matter--something	1
independent	1
of	1
cleverness	1
and	1
knowledge.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
watched	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
face	1
attentively,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
expression	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
boredom,	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
feminine	1
whispering	1
behind	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
observe	1
propriety.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
despised	1
cleverness	1
and	1
learning	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
patriotic	1
feeling	1
shown	1
by	1
Denisov,	1
but	1
despised	1
them	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
intellect,	1
feelings,	1
or	1
knowledge--he	1
did	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
display	1
any	1
of	1
these--but	1
because	1
of	1
something	1
else.	1
He	1
despised	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
age	1
and	1
experience	1
of	1
life.	1
The	1
only	1
instruction	1
Kutuzov	1
gave	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
during	1
that	1
report	1
referred	1
to	1
looting	1
by	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
report	1
the	1
general	1
put	1
before	1
him	1
for	1
signature	1
a	1
paper	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
payment	1
from	1
army	1
commanders	1
for	1
green	1
oats	1
mown	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
when	1
landowners	1
lodged	1
petitions	1
for	1
compensation.	1
	1
After	1
hearing	1
the	1
matter,	1
Kutuzov	1
smacked	1
his	1
lips	1
together	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Into	1
the	1
stove...	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
it!	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
once	1
for	1
all,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"into	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
all	1
such	1
things!	1
Let	1
them	1
cut	1
the	1
crops	1
and	1
burn	1
wood	1
to	1
their	1
hearts'	1
content.	1
I	1
don't	1
order	1
it	1
or	1
allow	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
exact	1
compensation	1
either.	1
One	1
can't	1
get	1
on	1
without	1
it.	1
'When	1
wood	1
is	1
chopped	1
the	1
chips	1
will	1
fly.'"	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
paper	1
again.	1
"Oh,	1
this	1
German	1
precision!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
all!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
as	1
he	1
signed	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
documents,	1
and	1
rising	1
heavily	1
and	1
smoothing	1
out	1
the	1
folds	1
in	1
his	1
fat	1
white	1
neck	1
he	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
cheerful	1
expression.	1
	1
The	1
priest's	1
wife,	1
flushing	1
rosy	1
red,	1
caught	1
up	1
the	1
dish	1
she	1
had	1
after	1
all	1
not	1
managed	1
to	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
moment,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
preparing	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
bow	1
offered	1
it	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
He	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
smiled,	1
lifted	1
her	1
chin	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"Ah,	1
what	1
a	1
beauty!	1
Thank	1
you,	1
sweetheart!"	1
	1
He	1
took	1
some	1
gold	1
pieces	1
from	1
his	1
trouser	1
pocket	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
dish	1
for	1
her.	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear,	1
and	1
how	1
are	1
we	1
getting	1
on?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
moving	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
assigned	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
priest's	1
wife	1
smiled,	1
and	1
with	1
dimples	1
in	1
her	1
rosy	1
cheeks	1
followed	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
adjutant	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
lunch	1
with	1
him.	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
again	1
called	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
He	1
found	1
him	1
reclining	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
unbuttoned	1
overcoat.	1
He	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
French	1
book	1
which	1
he	1
closed	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered,	1
marking	1
the	1
place	1
with	1
a	1
knife.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
cover	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Les	1
Chevaliers	1
du	1
Cygne	1
by	1
Madame	1
de	1
Genlis.	1
	1
"Well,	1
sit	1
down,	1
sit	1
down	1
here.	1
Let's	1
have	1
a	1
talk,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov.	1
"It's	1
sad,	1
very	1
sad.	1
But	1
remember,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
you,	1
a	1
second	1
father...."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
told	1
Kutuzov	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
death,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
when	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
it.	1
	1
"What...	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
us	1
to!"	1
Kutuzov	1
suddenly	1
cried	1
in	1
an	1
agitated	1
voice,	1
evidently	1
picturing	1
vividly	1
to	1
himself	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
story	1
the	1
condition	1
Russia	1
was	1
in.	1
"But	1
give	1
me	1
time,	1
give	1
me	1
time!"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
grim	1
look,	1
evidently	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
continue	1
this	1
agitating	1
conversation,	1
and	1
added:	1
"I	1
sent	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
"I	1
thank	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness,	1
but	1
I	1
fear	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
longer	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
staff,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
noticed.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
above	1
all,"	1
added	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"I	1
have	1
grown	1
used	1
to	1
my	1
regiment,	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
I	1
fancy	1
the	1
men	1
also	1
like	1
me.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
regiment.	1
If	1
I	1
decline	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
being	1
with	1
you,	1
believe	1
me..."	1
	1
A	1
shrewd,	1
kindly,	1
yet	1
subtly	1
derisive	1
expression	1
lit	1
up	1
Kutuzov's	1
podgy	1
face.	1
He	1
cut	1
Bolkonski	1
short.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry,	1
for	1
I	1
need	1
you.	1
But	1
you're	1
right,	1
you're	1
right!	1
It's	1
not	1
here	1
that	1
men	1
are	1
needed.	1
Advisers	1
are	1
always	1
plentiful,	1
but	1
men	1
are	1
not.	1
The	1
regiments	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
if	1
the	1
would-be	1
advisers	1
served	1
there	1
as	1
you	1
do.	1
I	1
remember	1
you	1
at	1
Austerlitz....	1
I	1
remember,	1
yes,	1
I	1
remember	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
standard!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
and	1
a	1
flush	1
of	1
pleasure	1
suffused	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
at	1
this	1
recollection.	1
	1
Taking	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
drawing	1
him	1
downwards,	1
Kutuzov	1
offered	1
his	1
cheek	1
to	1
be	1
kissed,	1
and	1
again	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
noticed	1
tears	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
eyes.	1
Though	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
knew	1
that	1
Kutuzov's	1
tears	1
came	1
easily,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
particularly	1
tender	1
to	1
and	1
considerate	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
show	1
sympathy	1
with	1
his	1
loss,	1
yet	1
this	1
reminder	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
was	1
both	1
pleasant	1
and	1
flattering	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Go	1
your	1
way	1
and	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
path	1
is	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
honor!"	1
He	1
paused.	1
"I	1
missed	1
you	1
at	1
Bucharest,	1
but	1
I	1
needed	1
someone	1
to	1
send."	1
And	1
changing	1
the	1
subject,	1
Kutuzov	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
Turkish	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
peace	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
concluded.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
blamed,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"both	1
for	1
that	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
peace...	1
but	1
everything	1
came	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time.	1
Tout	1
vient	1
a	1
point	1
a	1
celui	1
qui	1
sait	1
attendre.	1
*	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
as	1
many	1
advisers	1
there	1
as	1
here..."	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
"advisers"	1
which	1
evidently	1
occupied	1
him.	1
"Ah,	1
those	1
advisers!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"If	1
we	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
Turkey	1
and	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
through	1
with	1
that	1
war.	1
Everything	1
in	1
haste,	1
but	1
more	1
haste,	1
less	1
speed.	1
Kamenski	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
lost	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
died.	1
He	1
stormed	1
fortresses	1
with	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
difficult	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
fortress	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
win	1
a	1
campaign.	1
For	1
that,	1
not	1
storming	1
and	1
attacking	1
but	1
patience	1
and	1
time	1
are	1
wanted.	1
Kamenski	1
sent	1
soldiers	1
to	1
Rustchuk,	1
but	1
I	1
only	1
employed	1
these	1
two	1
things	1
and	1
took	1
more	1
fortresses	1
than	1
Kamenski	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
Turks	1
eat	1
horseflesh!"	1
He	1
swayed	1
his	1
head.	1
"And	1
the	1
French	1
shall	1
too,	1
believe	1
me,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
growing	1
warmer	1
and	1
beating	1
his	1
chest,	1
"I'll	1
make	1
them	1
eat	1
horseflesh!"	1
And	1
tears	1
again	1
dimmed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Everything	1
comes	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
wait."	1
	1
"But	1
shan't	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
accept	1
battle?"	1
remarked	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
if	1
everybody	1
wants	1
it;	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped....	1
But	1
believe	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
stronger	1
than	1
those	1
two:	1
patience	1
and	1
time,	1
they	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
all.	1
But	1
the	1
advisers	1
n'entendent	1
pas	1
de	1
cette	1
oreille,	1
voila	1
le	1
mal.	1
*	1
Some	1
want	1
a	1
thing--others	1
don't.	1
What's	1
one	1
to	1
do?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
evidently	1
expecting	1
an	1
answer.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
us	1
to	1
do?"	1
he	1
repeated	1
and	1
his	1
eye	1
shone	1
with	1
a	1
deep,	1
shrewd	1
look.	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
reply:	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
do.	1
Dans	1
le	1
doute,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
he	1
paused,	1
"abstiens-toi"	1
*(2)--he	1
articulated	1
the	1
French	1
proverb	1
deliberately.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Don't	1
see	1
it	1
that	1
way,	1
that's	1
the	1
trouble."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"When	1
in	1
doubt,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
do	1
nothing."	1
	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow;	1
remember	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
share	1
your	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
that	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
Serene	1
Highness,	1
nor	1
a	1
prince,	1
nor	1
a	1
commander-in-chief,	1
but	1
a	1
father!	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
anything	1
come	1
straight	1
to	1
me.	1
Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy."	1
	1
Again	1
he	1
embraced	1
and	1
kissed	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
but	1
before	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
Kutuzov	1
gave	1
a	1
sigh	1
of	1
relief	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
unfinished	1
novel,	1
Les	1
Chevaliers	1
du	1
Cygne	1
by	1
Madame	1
de	1
Genlis.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
explained	1
how	1
or	1
why	1
it	1
was,	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
interview	1
with	1
Kutuzov	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
regiment	1
reassured	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
affairs	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
entrusted.	1
The	1
more	1
he	1
realized	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
all	1
personal	1
motive	1
in	1
that	1
old	1
man--in	1
whom	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
remain	1
only	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
passions,	1
and	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
an	1
intellect	1
(grouping	1
events	1
and	1
drawing	1
conclusions)	1
only	1
the	1
capacity	1
calmly	1
to	1
contemplate	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events--the	1
more	1
reassured	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
should.	1
"He	1
will	1
not	1
bring	1
in	1
any	1
plan	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
devise	1
or	1
undertake	1
anything,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"but	1
he	1
will	1
hear	1
everything,	1
remember	1
everything,	1
and	1
put	1
everything	1
in	1
its	1
place.	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
hinder	1
anything	1
useful	1
nor	1
allow	1
anything	1
harmful.	1
He	1
understands	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
his	1
own	1
will--the	1
inevitable	1
course	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
he	1
can	1
see	1
them	1
and	1
grasp	1
their	1
significance,	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
significance	1
can	1
refrain	1
from	1
meddling	1
and	1
renounce	1
his	1
personal	1
wish	1
directed	1
to	1
something	1
else.	1
And	1
above	1
all,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"one	1
believes	1
in	1
him	1
because	1
he's	1
Russian,	1
despite	1
the	1
novel	1
by	1
Genlis	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
proverbs,	1
and	1
because	1
his	1
voice	1
shook	1
when	1
he	1
said:	1
'What	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
us	1
to!'	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
sob	1
in	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
'make	1
them	1
eat	1
horseflesh!'"	1
	1
On	1
such	1
feelings,	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
dimly	1
shared	1
by	1
all,	1
the	1
unanimity	1
and	1
general	1
approval	1
were	1
founded	1
with	1
which,	1
despite	1
court	1
influences,	1
the	1
popular	1
choice	1
of	1
Kutuzov	1
as	1
commander-in-chief	1
was	1
received.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
After	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow,	1
life	1
flowed	1
on	1
there	1
in	1
its	1
usual	1
course,	1
and	1
its	1
course	1
was	1
so	1
very	1
usual	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
recent	1
days	1
of	1
patriotic	1
elation	1
and	1
ardor,	1
hard	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
Russia	1
was	1
really	1
in	1
danger	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
were	1
also	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
Fatherland	1
ready	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
everything	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
recalled	1
the	1
patriotic	1
fervor	1
everyone	1
had	1
displayed	1
during	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
stay	1
was	1
the	1
call	1
for	1
contributions	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
money,	1
a	1
necessity	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
promises	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
assumed	1
a	1
legal,	1
official	1
form	1
and	1
became	1
unavoidable.	1
	1
With	1
the	1
enemy's	1
approach	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
Moscovites'	1
view	1
of	1
their	1
situation	1
did	1
not	1
grow	1
more	1
serious	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
became	1
even	1
more	1
frivolous,	1
as	1
always	1
happens	1
with	1
people	1
who	1
see	1
a	1
great	1
danger	1
approaching.	1
At	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
danger	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
two	1
voices	1
that	1
speak	1
with	1
equal	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
human	1
soul:	1
one	1
very	1
reasonably	1
tells	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
and	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
escaping	1
it;	1
the	1
other,	1
still	1
more	1
reasonably,	1
says	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
depressing	1
and	1
painful	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
danger,	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
man's	1
power	1
to	1
foresee	1
everything	1
and	1
avert	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
therefore	1
better	1
to	1
disregard	1
what	1
is	1
painful	1
till	1
it	1
comes,	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
what	1
is	1
pleasant.	1
In	1
solitude	1
a	1
man	1
generally	1
listens	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
voice,	1
but	1
in	1
society	1
to	1
the	1
second.	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
people	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
gay	1
in	1
Moscow	1
as	1
that	1
year.	1
	1
Rostopchin's	1
broadsheets,	1
headed	1
by	1
woodcuts	1
of	1
a	1
drink	1
shop,	1
a	1
potman,	1
and	1
a	1
Moscow	1
burgher	1
called	1
Karpushka	1
Chigirin,	1
"who--having	1
been	1
a	1
militiaman	1
and	1
having	1
had	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
at	1
the	1
pub--heard	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
wished	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
grew	1
angry,	1
abused	1
the	1
French	1
in	1
very	1
bad	1
language,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drink	1
shop,	1
and,	1
under	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
eagle,	1
began	1
to	1
address	1
the	1
assembled	1
people,"	1
were	1
read	1
and	1
discussed,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
latest	1
of	1
Vasili	1
Lvovich	1
Pushkin's	1
bouts	1
rimes.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
corner	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
club,	1
members	1
gathered	1
to	1
read	1
these	1
broadsheets,	1
and	1
some	1
liked	1
the	1
way	1
Karpushka	1
jeered	1
at	1
the	1
French,	1
saying:	1
"They	1
will	1
swell	1
up	1
with	1
Russian	1
cabbage,	1
burst	1
with	1
our	1
buckwheat	1
porridge,	1
and	1
choke	1
themselves	1
with	1
cabbage	1
soup.	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
dwarfs	1
and	1
one	1
peasant	1
woman	1
will	1
toss	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
hayfork."	1
Others	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
tone	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
stupid	1
and	1
vulgar.	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
that	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
expelled	1
all	1
Frenchmen	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
foreigners	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
spies	1
and	1
agents	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
among	1
them;	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
told	1
chiefly	1
to	1
introduce	1
Rostopchin's	1
witty	1
remark	1
on	1
that	1
occasion.	1
The	1
foreigners	1
were	1
deported	1
to	1
Nizhni	1
by	1
boat,	1
and	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
French:	1
"Rentrez	1
en	1
vousmemes;	1
entrez	1
dans	1
la	1
barque,	1
et	1
n'en	1
faites	1
pas	1
une	1
barque	1
de	1
Charon."	1
*	1
There	1
was	1
talk	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
government	1
offices	1
having	1
been	1
already	1
removed	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
Shinshin's	1
witticism	1
was	1
added--that	1
for	1
that	1
alone	1
Moscow	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
grateful	1
to	1
Napoleon.	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
that	1
Mamonov's	1
regiment	1
would	1
cost	1
him	1
eight	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rubles,	1
and	1
that	1
Bezukhov	1
had	1
spent	1
even	1
more	1
on	1
his,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
about	1
Bezukhov's	1
action	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
don	1
a	1
uniform	1
and	1
ride	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
without	1
charging	1
anything	1
for	1
the	1
show.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Think	1
it	1
over;	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
barque,	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
barque	1
of	1
Charon."	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
spare	1
anyone,"	1
said	1
Julie	1
Drubetskaya	1
as	1
she	1
collected	1
and	1
pressed	1
together	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
raveled	1
lint	1
with	1
her	1
thin,	1
beringed	1
fingers.	1
	1
Julie	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
was	1
giving	1
a	1
farewell	1
soiree.	1
	1
"Bezukhov	1
est	1
ridicule,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
kind	1
and	1
good-natured.	1
What	1
pleasure	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
caustique?"	1
	1
"A	1
forfeit!"	1
cried	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
militia	1
uniform	1
whom	1
Julie	1
called	1
"mon	1
chevalier,"	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
Nizhni.	1
	1
In	1
Julie's	1
set,	1
as	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
circles	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
agreed	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
speak	1
nothing	1
but	1
Russian	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
made	1
a	1
slip	1
and	1
spoke	1
French	1
should	1
pay	1
fines	1
to	1
the	1
Committee	1
of	1
Voluntary	1
Contributions.	1
	1
"Another	1
forfeit	1
for	1
a	1
Gallicism,"	1
said	1
a	1
Russian	1
writer	1
who	1
was	1
present.	1
"'What	1
pleasure	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
be'	1
is	1
not	1
Russian!"	1
	1
"You	1
spare	1
no	1
one,"	1
continued	1
Julie	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
without	1
heeding	1
the	1
author's	1
remark.	1
	1
"For	1
caustique--I	1
am	1
guilty	1
and	1
will	1
pay,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
prepared	1
to	1
pay	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
telling	1
you	1
the	1
truth.	1
For	1
Gallicisms	1
I	1
won't	1
be	1
responsible,"	1
she	1
remarked,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
author:	1
"I	1
have	1
neither	1
the	1
money	1
nor	1
the	1
time,	1
like	1
Prince	1
Galitsyn,	1
to	1
engage	1
a	1
master	1
to	1
teach	1
me	1
Russian!"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
here	1
he	1
is!"	1
she	1
added.	1
"Quand	1
on...	1
No,	1
no,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
militia	1
officer,	1
"you	1
won't	1
catch	1
me.	1
Speak	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
you	1
see	1
its	1
rays!"	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
amiably	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
"We	1
were	1
just	1
talking	1
of	1
you,"	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
the	1
facility	1
in	1
lying	1
natural	1
to	1
a	1
society	1
woman.	1
"We	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
your	1
regiment	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
Mamonov's."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
regiment,"	1
replied	1
Pierre,	1
kissing	1
his	1
hostess'	1
hand	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
her.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
sick	1
of	1
it."	1
	1
"You	1
will,	1
of	1
course,	1
command	1
it	1
yourself?"	1
said	1
Julie,	1
directing	1
a	1
sly,	1
sarcastic	1
glance	1
toward	1
the	1
militia	1
officer.	1
	1
The	1
latter	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
presence	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
caustic,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
expressed	1
perplexity	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
Julie's	1
smile	1
might	1
mean.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
absent-mindedness	1
and	1
good	1
nature,	1
Pierre's	1
personality	1
immediately	1
checked	1
any	1
attempt	1
to	1
ridicule	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
laughing	1
glance	1
at	1
his	1
big,	1
stout	1
body.	1
"I	1
should	1
make	1
too	1
good	1
a	1
target	1
for	1
the	1
French,	1
besides	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
I	1
should	1
hardly	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
climb	1
onto	1
a	1
horse."	1
	1
Among	1
those	1
whom	1
Julie's	1
guests	1
happened	1
to	1
choose	1
to	1
gossip	1
about	1
were	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
	1
"I	1
hear	1
that	1
their	1
affairs	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
way,"	1
said	1
Julie.	1
"And	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
unreasonable,	1
the	1
count	1
himself	1
I	1
mean.	1
The	1
Razumovskis	1
wanted	1
to	1
buy	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
his	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
it	1
drags	1
on	1
and	1
on.	1
He	1
asks	1
too	1
much."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
sale	1
will	1
come	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days,"	1
said	1
someone.	1
"Though	1
it	1
is	1
madness	1
to	1
buy	1
anything	1
in	1
Moscow	1
now."	1
	1
"Why?"	1
asked	1
Julie.	1
"You	1
don't	1
think	1
Moscow	1
is	1
in	1
danger?"	1
	1
"Then	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
leaving?"	1
	1
"I?	1
What	1
a	1
question!	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
because...	1
well,	1
because	1
everyone	1
is	1
going:	1
and	1
besides--I	1
am	1
not	1
Joan	1
of	1
Arc	1
or	1
an	1
Amazon."	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course,	1
of	1
course!	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
some	1
more	1
strips	1
of	1
linen."	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
manages	1
the	1
business	1
properly	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
pay	1
off	1
all	1
his	1
debts,"	1
said	1
the	1
militia	1
officer,	1
speaking	1
of	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"A	1
kindly	1
old	1
man	1
but	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
much.	1
And	1
why	1
do	1
they	1
stay	1
on	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
Moscow?	1
They	1
meant	1
to	1
leave	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
long	1
ago.	1
Natalie	1
is	1
quite	1
well	1
again	1
now,	1
isn't	1
she?"	1
Julie	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
knowing	1
smile.	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
waiting	1
for	1
their	1
younger	1
son,"	1
Pierre	1
replied.	1
"He	1
joined	1
Obolenski's	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Belaya	1
Tserkov	1
where	1
the	1
regiment	1
is	1
being	1
formed.	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
him	1
transferred	1
to	1
my	1
regiment	1
and	1
are	1
expecting	1
him	1
every	1
day.	1
The	1
count	1
wanted	1
to	1
leave	1
long	1
ago,	1
but	1
the	1
countess	1
won't	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
till	1
her	1
son	1
returns."	1
	1
"I	1
met	1
them	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
at	1
the	1
Arkharovs'.	1
Natalie	1
has	1
recovered	1
her	1
looks	1
and	1
is	1
brighter.	1
She	1
sang	1
a	1
song.	1
How	1
easily	1
some	1
people	1
get	1
over	1
everything!"	1
	1
"Get	1
over	1
what?"	1
inquired	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
displeased.	1
	1
Julie	1
smiled.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Count,	1
such	1
knights	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
only	1
found	1
in	1
Madame	1
de	1
Souza's	1
novels."	1
	1
"What	1
knights?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
demanded	1
Pierre,	1
blushing.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
come,	1
my	1
dear	1
count!	1
C'est	1
la	1
fable	1
de	1
tout	1
Moscou.	1
Je	1
vous	1
admire,	1
ma	1
parole	1
d'honneur!"	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
all	1
Moscow.	1
My	1
word,	1
I	1
admire	1
you!"	1
	1
"Forfeit,	1
forfeit!"	1
cried	1
the	1
militia	1
officer.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
one	1
can't	1
talk--how	1
tiresome!"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
'the	1
talk	1
of	1
all	1
Moscow'?"	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
angrily,	1
rising	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
"Come	1
now,	1
Count,	1
you	1
know!"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
friendly	1
with	1
Natalie,	1
and	1
so...	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
more	1
friendly	1
with	1
Vera--that	1
dear	1
Vera."	1
	1
"No,	1
madame!"	1
Pierre	1
continued	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
displeasure,	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
taken	1
on	1
myself	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
Natalie	1
Rostova's	1
knight	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
their	1
house	1
for	1
nearly	1
a	1
month.	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
cruelty..."	1
	1
"Qui	1
s'excuse	1
s'accuse,"	1
*	1
said	1
Julie,	1
smiling	1
and	1
waving	1
the	1
lint	1
triumphantly,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
last	1
word	1
she	1
promptly	1
changed	1
the	1
subject.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
heard	1
today?	1
Poor	1
Mary	1
Bolkonskaya	1
arrived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
yesterday.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
father?"	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Who	1
excuses	1
himself,	1
accuses	1
himself."	1
	1
"Really?	1
Where	1
is	1
she?	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
see	1
her,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
her	1
yesterday.	1
She	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
their	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow	1
either	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow	1
morning,	1
with	1
her	1
nephew."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
she?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
well,	1
but	1
sad.	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
rescued	1
her?	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
romance.	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov!	1
She	1
was	1
surrounded,	1
and	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
kill	1
her	1
and	1
had	1
wounded	1
some	1
of	1
her	1
people.	1
He	1
rushed	1
in	1
and	1
saved	1
her...."	1
	1
"Another	1
romance,"	1
said	1
the	1
militia	1
officer.	1
"Really,	1
this	1
general	1
flight	1
has	1
been	1
arranged	1
to	1
get	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
maids	1
married	1
off.	1
Catiche	1
is	1
one	1
and	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya	1
another."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
really	1
believe	1
she	1
is	1
un	1
petit	1
peu	1
amoureuse	1
du	1
jeune	1
homme."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"A	1
little	1
bit	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
man."	1
	1
"Forfeit,	1
forfeit,	1
forfeit!"	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
could	1
one	1
say	1
that	1
in	1
Russian?"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
returned	1
home	1
he	1
was	1
handed	1
two	1
of	1
Rostopchin's	1
broadsheets	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
declared	1
that	1
the	1
report	1
that	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
forbidden	1
people	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
was	1
false;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
that	1
ladies	1
and	1
tradesmen's	1
wives	1
were	1
leaving	1
the	1
city.	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
less	1
panic	1
and	1
less	1
gossip,"	1
ran	1
the	1
broadsheet	1
"but	1
I	1
will	1
stake	1
my	1
life	1
on	1
it	1
that	1
scoundrel	1
will	1
not	1
enter	1
Moscow."	1
These	1
words	1
showed	1
Pierre	1
clearly	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
would	1
enter	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
second	1
broadsheet	1
stated	1
that	1
our	1
headquarters	1
were	1
at	1
Vyazma,	1
that	1
Count	1
Wittgenstein	1
had	1
defeated	1
the	1
French,	1
but	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Moscow	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
armed,	1
weapons	1
were	1
ready	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
arsenal:	1
sabers,	1
pistols,	1
and	1
muskets	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
had	1
at	1
a	1
low	1
price.	1
The	1
tone	1
of	1
the	1
proclamation	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
jocose	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
Chigirin	1
talks.	1
Pierre	1
pondered	1
over	1
these	1
broadsheets.	1
Evidently	1
the	1
terrible	1
stormcloud	1
he	1
had	1
desired	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
but	1
which	1
yet	1
aroused	1
involuntary	1
horror	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
drawing	1
near.	1
	1
"Shall	1
I	1
join	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
enter	1
the	1
service,	1
or	1
wait?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
hundredth	1
time.	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
cards	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
them	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
patience.	1
	1
"If	1
this	1
patience	1
comes	1
out,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
after	1
shuffling	1
the	1
cards,	1
holding	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
head,	1
"if	1
it	1
comes	1
out,	1
it	1
means...	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean?"	1
	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
decided	1
what	1
it	1
should	1
mean	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
asking	1
whether	1
she	1
might	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
"Then	1
it	1
will	1
mean	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
army,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Come	1
in,	1
come	1
in!"	1
he	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
Only	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
stony	1
face	1
and	1
long	1
waist,	1
was	1
still	1
living	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
house.	1
The	1
two	1
younger	1
ones	1
had	1
both	1
married.	1
	1
"Excuse	1
my	1
coming	1
to	1
you,	1
cousin,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
reproachful	1
and	1
agitated	1
voice.	1
"You	1
know	1
some	1
decision	1
must	1
be	1
come	1
to.	1
What	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
happen?	1
Everyone	1
has	1
left	1
Moscow	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
rioting.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
staying	1
on?"	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
things	1
seem	1
satisfactory,	1
ma	1
cousine,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
in	1
the	1
bantering	1
tone	1
he	1
habitually	1
adopted	1
toward	1
her,	1
always	1
feeling	1
uncomfortable	1
in	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
her	1
benefactor.	1
	1
"Satisfactory,	1
indeed!	1
Very	1
satisfactory!	1
Barbara	1
Ivanovna	1
told	1
me	1
today	1
how	1
our	1
troops	1
are	1
distinguishing	1
themselves.	1
It	1
certainly	1
does	1
them	1
credit!	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
too	1
are	1
quite	1
mutinous--they	1
no	1
longer	1
obey,	1
even	1
my	1
maid	1
has	1
taken	1
to	1
being	1
rude.	1
At	1
this	1
rate	1
they	1
will	1
soon	1
begin	1
beating	1
us.	1
One	1
can't	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
But,	1
above	1
all,	1
the	1
French	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
any	1
day	1
now,	1
so	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
waiting	1
for?	1
I	1
ask	1
just	1
one	1
thing	1
of	1
you,	1
cousin,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
"arrange	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
Whatever	1
I	1
may	1
be,	1
I	1
can't	1
live	1
under	1
Bonaparte's	1
rule."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
come,	1
ma	1
cousine!	1
Where	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
your	1
information	1
from?	1
On	1
the	1
contrary..."	1
	1
"I	1
won't	1
submit	1
to	1
your	1
Napoleon!	1
Others	1
may	1
if	1
they	1
please....	1
If	1
you	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
this..."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
will,	1
I'll	1
give	1
the	1
order	1
at	1
once."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
was	1
apparently	1
vexed	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
anyone	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
with.	1
Muttering	1
to	1
herself,	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
chair.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
misinformed,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Everything	1
is	1
quiet	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
danger.	1
See!	1
I've	1
just	1
been	1
reading..."	1
He	1
showed	1
her	1
the	1
broadsheet.	1
"Count	1
Rostopchin	1
writes	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
stake	1
his	1
life	1
on	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
will	1
not	1
enter	1
Moscow."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
count	1
of	1
yours!"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
malevolently.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
hypocrite,	1
a	1
rascal	1
who	1
has	1
himself	1
roused	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
riot.	1
Didn't	1
he	1
write	1
in	1
those	1
idiotic	1
broadsheets	1
that	1
anyone,	1
'whoever	1
it	1
might	1
be,	1
should	1
be	1
dragged	1
to	1
the	1
lockup	1
by	1
his	1
hair'?	1
(How	1
silly!)	1
'And	1
honor	1
and	1
glory	1
to	1
whoever	1
captures	1
him,'	1
he	1
says.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
his	1
cajolery	1
has	1
brought	1
us	1
to!	1
Barbara	1
Ivanovna	1
told	1
me	1
the	1
mob	1
near	1
killed	1
her	1
because	1
she	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
French."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
it's	1
so...	1
You	1
take	1
everything	1
so	1
to	1
heart,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
began	1
laying	1
out	1
his	1
cards	1
for	1
patience.	1
	1
Although	1
that	1
patience	1
did	1
come	1
out,	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
join	1
the	1
army,	1
but	1
remained	1
in	1
deserted	1
Moscow	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
agitation,	1
irresolution,	1
and	1
alarm,	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
joyfully	1
expecting	1
something	1
terrible.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
toward	1
evening	1
the	1
princess	1
set	1
off,	1
and	1
Pierre's	1
head	1
steward	1
came	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
money	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
equipment	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
without	1
selling	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
estates.	1
In	1
general	1
the	1
head	1
steward	1
made	1
out	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
his	1
project	1
of	1
raising	1
a	1
regiment	1
would	1
ruin	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
him,	1
scarcely	1
able	1
to	1
repress	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
sell	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"What's	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
I	1
can't	1
draw	1
back	1
now!"	1
	1
The	1
worse	1
everything	1
became,	1
especially	1
his	1
own	1
affairs,	1
the	1
better	1
was	1
Pierre	1
pleased	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
evident	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
catastrophe	1
he	1
expected	1
was	1
approaching.	1
Hardly	1
anyone	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
town.	1
Julie	1
had	1
gone,	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Of	1
his	1
intimate	1
friends	1
only	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
remained,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
	1
To	1
distract	1
his	1
thoughts	1
he	1
drove	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Vorontsovo	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
balloon	1
Leppich	1
was	1
constructing	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
foe,	1
and	1
a	1
trial	1
balloon	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
next	1
day.	1
The	1
balloon	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
ready,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
learned	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
being	1
constructed	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
desire.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Leppich	1
is	1
ready,	1
get	1
together	1
a	1
crew	1
of	1
reliable	1
and	1
intelligent	1
men	1
for	1
his	1
car	1
and	1
send	1
a	1
courier	1
to	1
General	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know.	1
I	1
have	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
Please	1
impress	1
upon	1
Leppich	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
careful	1
where	1
he	1
descends	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
mistake	1
and	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
enemy's	1
hands.	1
It	1
is	1
essential	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
combine	1
his	1
movements	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
home	1
from	1
Vorontsovo,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
passing	1
the	1
Bolotnoe	1
Place	1
Pierre,	1
seeing	1
a	1
large	1
crowd	1
round	1
the	1
Lobnoe	1
Place,	1
stopped	1
and	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
trap.	1
A	1
French	1
cook	1
accused	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
spy	1
was	1
being	1
flogged.	1
The	1
flogging	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
over,	1
and	1
the	1
executioner	1
was	1
releasing	1
from	1
the	1
flogging	1
bench	1
a	1
stout	1
man	1
with	1
red	1
whiskers,	1
in	1
blue	1
stockings	1
and	1
a	1
green	1
jacket,	1
who	1
was	1
moaning	1
piteously.	1
Another	1
criminal,	1
thin	1
and	1
pale,	1
stood	1
near.	1
Judging	1
by	1
their	1
faces	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
Frenchmen.	1
With	1
a	1
frightened	1
and	1
suffering	1
look	1
resembling	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
thin	1
Frenchman's	1
face,	1
Pierre	1
pushed	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
Who	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
for?"	1
he	1
kept	1
asking.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
crowd--officials,	1
burghers,	1
shopkeepers,	1
peasants,	1
and	1
women	1
in	1
cloaks	1
and	1
in	1
pelisses--was	1
so	1
eagerly	1
centered	1
on	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
Lobnoe	1
Place	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
answered	1
him.	1
The	1
stout	1
man	1
rose,	1
frowned,	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
firm	1
began	1
to	1
pull	1
on	1
his	1
jacket	1
without	1
looking	1
about	1
him,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
his	1
lips	1
trembled	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
full-blooded	1
grown-up	1
men	1
cry,	1
though	1
angry	1
with	1
himself	1
for	1
doing	1
so.	1
In	1
the	1
crowd	1
people	1
began	1
talking	1
loudly,	1
to	1
stifle	1
their	1
feelings	1
of	1
pity	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"He's	1
cook	1
to	1
some	1
prince."	1
	1
"Eh,	1
mounseer,	1
Russian	1
sauce	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
sour	1
to	1
a	1
Frenchman...	1
sets	1
his	1
teeth	1
on	1
edge!"	1
said	1
a	1
wrinkled	1
clerk	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
behind	1
Pierre,	1
when	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
The	1
clerk	1
glanced	1
round,	1
evidently	1
hoping	1
that	1
his	1
joke	1
would	1
be	1
appreciated.	1
Some	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
laugh,	1
others	1
continued	1
to	1
watch	1
in	1
dismay	1
the	1
executioner	1
who	1
was	1
undressing	1
the	1
other	1
man.	1
	1
Pierre	1
choked,	1
his	1
face	1
puckered,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
hastily	1
away,	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
trap	1
muttering	1
something	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
seat.	1
As	1
they	1
drove	1
along	1
he	1
shuddered	1
and	1
exclaimed	1
several	1
times	1
so	1
audibly	1
that	1
the	1
coachman	1
asked	1
him:	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
your	1
pleasure?"	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
shouted	1
Pierre	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
who	1
was	1
driving	1
to	1
Lubyanka	1
Street.	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
Governor's,	1
as	1
you	1
ordered,"	1
answered	1
the	1
coachman.	1
	1
"Fool!	1
Idiot!"	1
shouted	1
Pierre,	1
abusing	1
his	1
coachman--a	1
thing	1
he	1
rarely	1
did.	1
"Home,	1
I	1
told	1
you!	1
And	1
drive	1
faster,	1
blockhead!"	1
"I	1
must	1
get	1
away	1
this	1
very	1
day,"	1
he	1
murmured	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
tortured	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
surrounding	1
the	1
Lobnoe	1
Place,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
so	1
definitely	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
would	1
leave	1
for	1
the	1
army	1
that	1
very	1
day	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
either	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
coachman	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
it	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
home	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
Evstafey--his	1
head	1
coachman	1
who	1
knew	1
everything,	1
could	1
do	1
anything,	1
and	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
Moscow--that	1
he	1
would	1
leave	1
that	1
night	1
for	1
the	1
army	1
at	1
Mozhaysk,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
saddle	1
horses	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
there.	1
This	1
could	1
not	1
all	1
be	1
arranged	1
that	1
day,	1
so	1
on	1
Evstafey's	1
representation	1
Pierre	1
had	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
his	1
departure	1
till	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
allow	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
relay	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
on	1
in	1
advance.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-fourth	1
the	1
weather	1
cleared	1
up	1
after	1
a	1
spell	1
of	1
rain,	1
and	1
after	1
dinner	1
Pierre	1
left	1
Moscow.	1
When	1
changing	1
horses	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
Perkhushkovo,	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
battle	1
that	1
evening.	1
(This	1
was	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Shevardino.)	1
He	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
there	1
in	1
Perkhushkovo	1
the	1
earth	1
trembled	1
from	1
the	1
firing,	1
but	1
nobody	1
could	1
answer	1
his	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
had	1
won.	1
At	1
dawn	1
next	1
day	1
Pierre	1
was	1
approaching	1
Mozhaysk.	1
	1
Every	1
house	1
in	1
Mozhaysk	1
had	1
soldiers	1
quartered	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
hostel	1
where	1
Pierre	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
his	1
groom	1
and	1
coachman	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
room	1
to	1
be	1
had.	1
It	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
officers.	1
	1
Everywhere	1
in	1
Mozhaysk	1
and	1
beyond	1
it,	1
troops	1
were	1
stationed	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
march.	1
Cossacks,	1
foot	1
and	1
horse	1
soldiers,	1
wagons,	1
caissons,	1
and	1
cannon	1
were	1
everywhere.	1
Pierre	1
pushed	1
forward	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
the	1
farther	1
he	1
left	1
Moscow	1
behind	1
and	1
the	1
deeper	1
he	1
plunged	1
into	1
that	1
sea	1
of	1
troops	1
the	1
more	1
was	1
he	1
overcome	1
by	1
restless	1
agitation	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
joyful	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
experienced	1
before.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
Sloboda	1
Palace	1
during	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
visit--a	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
undertaking	1
something	1
and	1
sacrificing	1
something.	1
He	1
now	1
experienced	1
a	1
glad	1
consciousness	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
constitutes	1
men's	1
happiness--the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life,	1
wealth,	1
even	1
life	1
itself--is	1
rubbish	1
it	1
is	1
pleasant	1
to	1
throw	1
away,	1
compared	1
with	1
something...	1
With	1
what?	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
say,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
determine	1
for	1
whom	1
and	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
felt	1
such	1
particular	1
delight	1
in	1
sacrificing	1
everything.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
occupied	1
with	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
what	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
for;	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
sacrificing	1
in	1
itself	1
afforded	1
him	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
joyous	1
sensation.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-fourth	1
of	1
August	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
was	1
fought,	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fifth	1
not	1
a	1
shot	1
was	1
fired	1
by	1
either	1
side,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
itself	1
took	1
place.	1
	1
Why	1
and	1
how	1
were	1
the	1
battles	1
of	1
Shevardino	1
and	1
Borodino	1
given	1
and	1
accepted?	1
Why	1
was	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
fought?	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
sense	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
either	1
the	1
French	1
or	1
the	1
Russians.	1
Its	1
immediate	1
result	1
for	1
the	1
Russians	1
was,	1
and	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
be,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
brought	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow--which	1
we	1
feared	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
its	1
immediate	1
result	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
their	1
whole	1
army--which	1
they	1
feared	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
What	1
the	1
result	1
must	1
be	1
was	1
quite	1
obvious,	1
and	1
yet	1
Napoleon	1
offered	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
accepted	1
that	1
battle.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
commanders	1
had	1
been	1
guided	1
by	1
reason,	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
obvious	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
that	1
by	1
advancing	1
thirteen	1
hundred	1
miles	1
and	1
giving	1
battle	1
with	1
a	1
probability	1
of	1
losing	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
his	1
army,	1
he	1
was	1
advancing	1
to	1
certain	1
destruction,	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
equally	1
clear	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
that	1
by	1
accepting	1
battle	1
and	1
risking	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
lose	1
Moscow.	1
For	1
Kutuzov	1
this	1
was	1
mathematically	1
clear,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
when	1
playing	1
draughts	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
man	1
less	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
exchanging,	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
lose,	1
and	1
therefore	1
should	1
not	1
exchange.	1
When	1
my	1
opponent	1
has	1
sixteen	1
men	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
fourteen,	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
one	1
eighth	1
weaker	1
than	1
he,	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
exchanged	1
thirteen	1
more	1
men	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
Before	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
our	1
strength	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
about	1
as	1
five	1
to	1
six,	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
battle	1
it	1
was	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
to	1
two:	1
previously	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
against	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand;	1
afterwards	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
against	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand.	1
Yet	1
the	1
shrewd	1
and	1
experienced	1
Kutuzov	1
accepted	1
the	1
battle,	1
while	1
Napoleon,	1
who	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
commander	1
of	1
genius,	1
gave	1
it,	1
losing	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
and	1
lengthening	1
his	1
lines	1
of	1
communication	1
still	1
more.	1
If	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
campaign	1
by	1
occupying	1
Moscow	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
ended	1
a	1
previous	1
campaign	1
by	1
occupying	1
Vienna,	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
evidence	1
to	1
the	1
contrary.	1
Napoleon's	1
historians	1
themselves	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
onwards	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
stop,	1
knew	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
his	1
extended	1
position,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
Moscow	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
the	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
Russian	1
towns	1
were	1
left	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
received	1
a	1
single	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
repeated	1
announcements	1
of	1
his	1
wish	1
to	1
negotiate.	1
	1
In	1
giving	1
and	1
accepting	1
battle	1
at	1
Borodino,	1
Kutuzov	1
acted	1
involuntarily	1
and	1
irrationally.	1
But	1
later	1
on,	1
to	1
fit	1
what	1
had	1
occurred,	1
the	1
historians	1
provided	1
cunningly	1
devised	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
foresight	1
and	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
who,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
blind	1
tools	1
of	1
history	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
enslaved	1
and	1
involuntary.	1
	1
The	1
ancients	1
have	1
left	1
us	1
model	1
heroic	1
poems	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
heroes	1
furnish	1
the	1
whole	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
story,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
still	1
unable	1
to	1
accustom	1
ourselves	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
for	1
our	1
epoch	1
histories	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
are	1
meaningless.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
question,	1
how	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
preceding	1
battle	1
of	1
Shevardino	1
were	1
fought,	1
there	1
also	1
exists	1
a	1
definite	1
and	1
well-	1
known,	1
but	1
quite	1
false,	1
conception.	1
All	1
the	1
historians	1
describe	1
the	1
affair	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
army,	1
they	1
say,	1
in	1
its	1
retreat	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
sought	1
out	1
for	1
itself	1
the	1
best	1
position	1
for	1
a	1
general	1
engagement	1
and	1
found	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
at	1
Borodino.	1
	1
The	1
Russians,	1
they	1
say,	1
fortified	1
this	1
position	1
in	1
advance	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
highroad	1
(from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Smolensk)	1
and	1
almost	1
at	1
a	1
right	1
angle	1
to	1
it,	1
from	1
Borodino	1
to	1
Utitsa,	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
fought.	1
	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
this	1
position,	1
they	1
say,	1
a	1
fortified	1
outpost	1
was	1
set	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
mound	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
enemy.	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-fourth,	1
we	1
are	1
told,	1
Napoleon	1
attacked	1
this	1
advanced	1
post	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-sixth,	1
attacked	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
army,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
position	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
	1
So	1
the	1
histories	1
say,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
quite	1
wrong,	1
as	1
anyone	1
who	1
cares	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
matter	1
can	1
easily	1
convince	1
himself.	1
	1
The	1
Russians	1
did	1
not	1
seek	1
out	1
the	1
best	1
position	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
during	1
the	1
retreat	1
passed	1
many	1
positions	1
better	1
than	1
Borodino.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
at	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
positions	1
because	1
Kutuzov	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
occupy	1
a	1
position	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
himself	1
chosen,	1
because	1
the	1
popular	1
demand	1
for	1
a	1
battle	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
expressed	1
itself	1
strongly	1
enough,	1
and	1
because	1
Miloradovich	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
arrived	1
with	1
the	1
militia,	1
and	1
for	1
many	1
other	1
reasons.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
other	1
positions	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
were	1
stronger,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
position	1
at	1
Borodino	1
(the	1
one	1
where	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
fought),	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
strong,	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
position	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
spot	1
one	1
might	1
find	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
Empire	1
by	1
sticking	1
a	1
pin	1
into	1
the	1
map	1
at	1
hazard.	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
the	1
Russians	1
not	1
fortify	1
the	1
position	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Borodino	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
right	1
angle	1
to,	1
the	1
highroad	1
(that	1
is,	1
the	1
position	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
battle	1
took	1
place),	1
but	1
never	1
till	1
the	1
twenty-	1
fifth	1
of	1
August,	1
1812,	1
did	1
they	1
think	1
that	1
a	1
battle	1
might	1
be	1
fought	1
there.	1
This	1
was	1
shown	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
entrenchments	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
twenty	1
fifth	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
begun	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fifth	1
and	1
twenty-sixth	1
were	1
not	1
completed,	1
and	1
secondly,	1
by	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt.	1
That	1
redoubt	1
was	1
quite	1
senseless	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
where	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
accepted.	1
Why	1
was	1
it	1
more	1
strongly	1
fortified	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
post?	1
And	1
why	1
were	1
all	1
efforts	1
exhausted	1
and	1
six	1
thousand	1
men	1
sacrificed	1
to	1
defend	1
it	1
till	1
late	1
at	1
night	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fourth?	1
A	1
Cossack	1
patrol	1
would	1
have	1
sufficed	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Thirdly,	1
as	1
proof	1
that	1
the	1
position	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
fought	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
foreseen	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
advanced	1
post	1
of	1
that	1
position,	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
twenty-	1
fifth,	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly	1
and	1
Bagration	1
were	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
was	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
position,	1
and	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
report,	1
written	1
in	1
hot	1
haste	1
after	1
the	1
battle,	1
speaks	1
of	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
as	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
position.	1
It	1
was	1
much	1
later,	1
when	1
reports	1
on	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
were	1
written	1
at	1
leisure,	1
that	1
the	1
incorrect	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
statement	1
was	1
invented	1
(probably	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
mistakes	1
of	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
represented	1
as	1
infallible)	1
that	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
was	1
an	1
advanced	1
post--whereas	1
in	1
reality	1
it	1
was	1
simply	1
a	1
fortified	1
point	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank--and	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
fought	1
by	1
us	1
on	1
an	1
entrenched	1
position	1
previously	1
selected,	1
where	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
fought	1
on	1
a	1
quite	1
unexpected	1
spot	1
which	1
was	1
almost	1
unentrenched.	1
	1
The	1
case	1
was	1
evidently	1
this:	1
a	1
position	1
was	1
selected	1
along	1
the	1
river	1
Kolocha--which	1
crosses	1
the	1
highroad	1
not	1
at	1
a	1
right	1
angle	1
but	1
at	1
an	1
acute	1
angle--so	1
that	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
was	1
at	1
Shevardino,	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
near	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Novoe,	1
and	1
the	1
center	1
at	1
Borodino	1
at	1
the	1
confluence	1
of	1
the	1
rivers	1
Kolocha	1
and	1
Voyna.	1
	1
To	1
anyone	1
who	1
looks	1
at	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Borodino	1
without	1
thinking	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
actually	1
fought,	1
this	1
position,	1
protected	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Kolocha,	1
presents	1
itself	1
as	1
obvious	1
for	1
an	1
army	1
whose	1
object	1
was	1
to	1
prevent	1
an	1
enemy	1
from	1
advancing	1
along	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
Napoleon,	1
riding	1
to	1
Valuevo	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fourth,	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
(as	1
the	1
history	1
books	1
say	1
he	1
did)	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
from	1
Utitsa	1
to	1
Borodino	1
(he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
position	1
because	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
exist),	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
see	1
an	1
advanced	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
but	1
while	1
pursuing	1
the	1
Russian	1
rearguard	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
position--at	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt--and	1
unexpectedly	1
for	1
the	1
Russians	1
moved	1
his	1
army	1
across	1
the	1
Kolocha.	1
And	1
the	1
Russians,	1
not	1
having	1
time	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
general	1
engagement,	1
withdrew	1
their	1
left	1
wing	1
from	1
the	1
position	1
they	1
had	1
intended	1
to	1
occupy	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
position	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
foreseen	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
fortified.	1
By	1
crossing	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Kolocha	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
highroad,	1
Napoleon	1
shifted	1
the	1
whole	1
forthcoming	1
battle	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left	1
(looking	1
from	1
the	1
Russian	1
side)	1
and	1
transferred	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
plain	1
between	1
Utitsa,	1
Semenovsk,	1
and	1
Borodino--a	1
plain	1
no	1
more	1
advantageous	1
as	1
a	1
position	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
plain	1
in	1
Russia--and	1
there	1
the	1
whole	1
battle	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
of	1
August	1
took	1
place.	1
	1
Had	1
Napoleon	1
not	1
ridden	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-fourth	1
to	1
the	1
Kolocha,	1
and	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
then	1
ordered	1
an	1
immediate	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
redoubt	1
but	1
had	1
begun	1
the	1
attack	1
next	1
morning,	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
doubted	1
that	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
was	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
our	1
position,	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
place	1
where	1
we	1
expected	1
it.	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
we	1
should	1
probably	1
have	1
defended	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt--our	1
left	1
flank--	1
still	1
more	1
obstinately.	1
We	1
should	1
have	1
attacked	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
right,	1
and	1
the	1
engagement	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fifth,	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
we	1
intended	1
and	1
had	1
fortified.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
attack	1
on	1
our	1
left	1
flank	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
after	1
the	1
retreat	1
of	1
our	1
rear	1
guard	1
(that	1
is,	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
fight	1
at	1
Gridneva),	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
did	1
not	1
wish,	1
or	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
time,	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
general	1
engagement	1
then	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-fourth,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
chief	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
already	1
lost	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fourth,	1
and	1
obviously	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
fought	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-sixth.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt,	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-fifth	1
without	1
a	1
position	1
for	1
our	1
left	1
flank,	1
and	1
were	1
forced	1
to	1
bend	1
it	1
back	1
and	1
hastily	1
entrench	1
it	1
where	1
it	1
chanced	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
was	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
defended	1
by	1
weak,	1
unfinished	1
entrenchments,	1
but	1
the	1
disadvantage	1
of	1
that	1
position	1
was	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders--not	1
having	1
fully	1
realized	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
namely	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
our	1
position	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
and	1
the	1
shifting	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
field	1
of	1
the	1
forthcoming	1
battle	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left--maintained	1
their	1
extended	1
position	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Novoe	1
to	1
Utitsa,	1
and	1
consequently	1
had	1
to	1
move	1
their	1
forces	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left	1
during	1
the	1
battle.	1
So	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
battle	1
the	1
Russians	1
opposed	1
the	1
entire	1
French	1
army	1
launched	1
against	1
our	1
left	1
flank	1
with	1
but	1
half	1
as	1
many	1
men.	1
(Poniatowski's	1
action	1
against	1
Utitsa,	1
and	1
Uvarov's	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
against	1
the	1
French,	1
were	1
actions	1
distinct	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
battle.)	1
So	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
place	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
(in	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
conceal	1
our	1
commanders'	1
mistakes	1
even	1
at	1
the	1

CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-fifth	1
Pierre	1
was	1
leaving	1
Mozhaysk.	1
At	1
the	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
steep	1
hill,	1
down	1
which	1
a	1
winding	1
road	1
led	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
past	1
the	1
cathedral	1
on	1
the	1
right,	1
where	1
a	1
service	1
was	1
being	1
held	1
and	1
the	1
bells	1
were	1
ringing,	1
Pierre	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
vehicle	1
and	1
proceeded	1
on	1
foot.	1
Behind	1
him	1
a	1
cavalry	1
regiment	1
was	1
coming	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
preceded	1
by	1
its	1
singers.	1
Coming	1
up	1
toward	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
carts	1
carrying	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
engagement	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
The	1
peasant	1
drivers,	1
shouting	1
and	1
lashing	1
their	1
horses,	1
kept	1
crossing	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side.	1
The	1
carts,	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
which	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
wounded	1
soldiers	1
were	1
lying	1
or	1
sitting,	1
jolted	1
over	1
the	1
stones	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
on	1
the	1
steep	1
incline	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
road.	1
The	1
wounded,	1
bandaged	1
with	1
rags,	1
with	1
pale	1
cheeks,	1
compressed	1
lips,	1
and	1
knitted	1
brows,	1
held	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
carts	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
jolted	1
against	1
one	1
another.	1
Almost	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
stared	1
with	1
naive,	1
childlike	1
curiosity	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
white	1
hat	1
and	1
green	1
swallow-tail	1
coat.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
coachman	1
shouted	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
convoy	1
of	1
wounded	1
to	1
keep	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
cavalry	1
regiment,	1
as	1
it	1
descended	1
the	1
hill	1
with	1
its	1
singers,	1
surrounded	1
Pierre's	1
carriage	1
and	1
blocked	1
the	1
road.	1
Pierre	1
stopped,	1
being	1
pressed	1
against	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
cutting	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
road	1
ran.	1
The	1
sunshine	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
hill	1
did	1
not	1
penetrate	1
into	1
the	1
cutting	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
damp,	1
but	1
above	1
Pierre's	1
head	1
was	1
the	1
bright	1
August	1
sunshine	1
and	1
the	1
bells	1
sounded	1
merrily.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
carts	1
with	1
wounded	1
stopped	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
close	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
driver	1
in	1
his	1
bast	1
shoes	1
ran	1
panting	1
up	1
to	1
it,	1
placed	1
a	1
stone	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
tireless	1
hind	1
wheels,	1
and	1
began	1
arranging	1
the	1
breech-band	1
on	1
his	1
little	1
horse.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
wounded,	1
an	1
old	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
bandaged	1
arm	1
who	1
was	1
following	1
the	1
cart	1
on	1
foot,	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
sound	1
hand	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
fellow	1
countryman!	1
Will	1
they	1
set	1
us	1
down	1
here	1
or	1
take	1
us	1
on	1
to	1
Moscow?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
so	1
deep	1
in	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
question.	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
cavalry	1
regiment	1
that	1
had	1
met	1
the	1
convoy	1
of	1
wounded,	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
cart	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
standing,	1
in	1
which	1
two	1
wounded	1
men	1
were	1
sitting	1
and	1
one	1
was	1
lying.	1
One	1
of	1
those	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
cart	1
had	1
probably	1
been	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
cheek.	1
His	1
whole	1
head	1
was	1
wrapped	1
in	1
rags	1
and	1
one	1
cheek	1
was	1
swollen	1
to	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
baby's	1
head.	1
His	1
nose	1
and	1
mouth	1
were	1
twisted	1
to	1
one	1
side.	1
This	1
soldier	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
cathedral	1
and	1
crossing	1
himself.	1
Another,	1
a	1
young	1
lad,	1
a	1
fair-haired	1
recruit	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
blood	1
in	1
his	1
thin	1
face,	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
kindly,	1
with	1
a	1
fixed	1
smile.	1
The	1
third	1
lay	1
prone	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
not	1
visible.	1
The	1
cavalry	1
singers	1
were	1
passing	1
close	1
by:	1
	1
	1
Ah	1
lost,	1
quite	1
lost...	1
is	1
my	1
head	1
so	1
keen,	1
Living	1
in	1
a	1
foreign	1
land.	1
	1
they	1
sang	1
their	1
soldiers'	1
dance	1
song.	1
	1
As	1
if	1
responding	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
different	1
sort	1
of	1
merriment,	1
the	1
metallic	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
bells	1
reverberated	1
high	1
above	1
and	1
the	1
hot	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
bathed	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
slope	1
with	1
yet	1
another	1
sort	1
of	1
merriment.	1
But	1
beneath	1
the	1
slope,	1
by	1
the	1
cart	1
with	1
the	1
wounded	1
near	1
the	1
panting	1
little	1
nag	1
where	1
Pierre	1
stood,	1
it	1
was	1
damp,	1
somber,	1
and	1
sad.	1
	1
The	1
soldier	1
with	1
the	1
swollen	1
cheek	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
cavalry	1
singers.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
coxcombs!"	1
he	1
muttered	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
the	1
soldiers	1
only,	1
but	1
I've	1
seen	1
peasants	1
today,	1
too....	1
The	1
peasants--even	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
go,"	1
said	1
the	1
soldier	1
behind	1
the	1
cart,	1
addressing	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
smile.	1
"No	1
distinctions	1
made	1
nowadays....	1
They	1
want	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
them--in	1
a	1
word,	1
it's	1
Moscow!	1
They	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it."	1
	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
obscurity	1
of	1
the	1
soldier's	1
words	1
Pierre	1
understood	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
nodded	1
approval.	1
	1
The	1
road	1
was	1
clear	1
again;	1
Pierre	1
descended	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
drove	1
on.	1
	1
He	1
kept	1
looking	1
to	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
for	1
familiar	1
faces,	1
but	1
only	1
saw	1
everywhere	1
the	1
unfamiliar	1
faces	1
of	1
various	1
military	1
men	1
of	1
different	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
service,	1
who	1
all	1
looked	1
with	1
astonishment	1
at	1
his	1
white	1
hat	1
and	1
green	1
tail	1
coat.	1
	1
Having	1
gone	1
nearly	1
three	1
miles	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
met	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
eagerly	1
addressed	1
him.	1
This	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
army	1
doctors.	1
He	1
was	1
driving	1
toward	1
Pierre	1
in	1
a	1
covered	1
gig,	1
sitting	1
beside	1
a	1
young	1
surgeon,	1
and	1
on	1
recognizing	1
Pierre	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
Cossack	1
who	1
occupied	1
the	1
driver's	1
seat	1
to	1
pull	1
up.	1
	1
"Count!	1
Your	1
excellency,	1
how	1
come	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
here?"	1
asked	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
see..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
something	1
to	1
see...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
got	1
out	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
doctor,	1
explaining	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
battle.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
apply	1
direct	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
God	1
knows	1
where	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
during	1
the	1
battle?"	1
he	1
said,	1
exchanging	1
glances	1
with	1
his	1
young	1
companion.	1
"Anyhow	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
knows	1
you	1
and	1
will	1
receive	1
you	1
graciously.	1
That's	1
what	1
you	1
must	1
do."	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
seemed	1
tired	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
so?...	1
Ah,	1
I	1
also	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
where	1
our	1
position	1
is	1
exactly?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"The	1
position?"	1
repeated	1
the	1
doctor.	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
not	1
my	1
line.	1
Drive	1
past	1
Tatarinova,	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
digging	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
there.	1
Go	1
up	1
the	1
hillock	1
and	1
you'll	1
see."	1
	1
"Can	1
one	1
see	1
from	1
there?...	1
If	1
you	1
would..."	1
	1
But	1
the	1
doctor	1
interrupted	1
him	1
and	1
moved	1
toward	1
his	1
gig.	1
	1
"I	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
you	1
but	1
on	1
my	1
honor	1
I'm	1
up	1
to	1
here"--and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
his	1
throat.	1
"I'm	1
galloping	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
corps.	1
How	1
do	1
matters	1
stand?...	1
You	1
know,	1
Count,	1
there'll	1
be	1
a	1
battle	1
tomorrow.	1
Out	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
we	1
must	1
expect	1
at	1
least	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
wounded,	1
and	1
we	1
haven't	1
stretchers,	1
or	1
bunks,	1
or	1
dressers,	1
or	1
doctors	1
enough	1
for	1
six	1
thousand.	1
We	1
have	1
ten	1
thousand	1
carts,	1
but	1
we	1
need	1
other	1
things	1
as	1
well--we	1
must	1
manage	1
as	1
best	1
we	1
can!"	1
	1
The	1
strange	1
thought	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
men,	1
young	1
and	1
old,	1
who	1
had	1
stared	1
with	1
merry	1
surprise	1
at	1
his	1
hat	1
(perhaps	1
the	1
very	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
noticed),	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
were	1
inevitably	1
doomed	1
to	1
wounds	1
and	1
death	1
amazed	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"They	1
may	1
die	1
tomorrow;	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
thinking	1
of	1
anything	1
but	1
death?"	1
And	1
by	1
some	1
latent	1
sequence	1
of	1
thought	1
the	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
Mozhaysk	1
hill,	1
the	1
carts	1
with	1
the	1
wounded,	1
the	1
ringing	1
bells,	1
the	1
slanting	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
cavalrymen	1
vividly	1
recurred	1
to	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"The	1
cavalry	1
ride	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
meet	1
the	1
wounded	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
awaits	1
them,	1
but	1
pass	1
by,	1
winking	1
at	1
the	1
wounded.	1
Yet	1
from	1
among	1
these	1
men	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
are	1
doomed	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
they	1
wonder	1
at	1
my	1
hat!	1
Strange!"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
continuing	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
Tatarinova.	1
	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
landowner's	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
stood	1
carriages,	1
wagons,	1
and	1
crowds	1
of	1
orderlies	1
and	1
sentinels.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
was	1
putting	1
up	1
there,	1
but	1
just	1
when	1
Pierre	1
arrived	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
and	1
hardly	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
were	1
there--they	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
service.	1
Pierre	1
drove	1
on	1
toward	1
Gorki.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
ascended	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
little	1
village	1
street,	1
he	1
saw	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
peasant	1
militiamen	1
in	1
their	1
white	1
shirts	1
and	1
with	1
crosses	1
on	1
their	1
caps,	1
who,	1
talking	1
and	1
laughing	1
loudly,	1
animated	1
and	1
perspiring,	1
were	1
at	1
work	1
on	1
a	1
huge	1
knoll	1
overgrown	1
with	1
grass	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
digging,	1
others	1
were	1
wheeling	1
barrowloads	1
of	1
earth	1
along	1
planks,	1
while	1
others	1
stood	1
about	1
doing	1
nothing.	1
	1
Two	1
officers	1
were	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
knoll,	1
directing	1
the	1
men.	1
On	1
seeing	1
these	1
peasants,	1
who	1
were	1
evidently	1
still	1
amused	1
by	1
the	1
novelty	1
of	1
their	1
position	1
as	1
soldiers,	1
Pierre	1
once	1
more	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
men	1
at	1
Mozhaysk	1
and	1
understood	1
what	1
the	1
soldier	1
had	1
meant	1
when	1
he	1
said:	1
"They	1
want	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
them."	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
these	1
bearded	1
peasants	1
at	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield,	1
with	1
their	1
queer,	1
clumsy	1
boots	1
and	1
perspiring	1
necks,	1
and	1
their	1
shirts	1
opening	1
from	1
the	1
left	1
toward	1
the	1
middle,	1
unfastened,	1
exposing	1
their	1
sunburned	1
collarbones,	1
impressed	1
Pierre	1
more	1
strongly	1
with	1
the	1
solemnity	1
and	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
than	1
anything	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
seen	1
or	1
heard.	1

XXI	1
	1
Pierre	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
and,	1
passing	1
the	1
toiling	1
militiamen,	1
ascended	1
the	1
knoll	1
from	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
doctor,	1
the	1
battlefield	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
eleven	1
o'clock.	1
The	1
sun	1
shone	1
somewhat	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
and	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
brightly	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
enormous	1
panorama	1
which,	1
rising	1
like	1
an	1
amphitheater,	1
extended	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
rarefied	1
atmosphere.	1
	1
From	1
above	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
bisecting	1
that	1
amphitheater,	1
wound	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
highroad,	1
passing	1
through	1
a	1
village	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
church	1
some	1
five	1
hundred	1
paces	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
knoll	1
and	1
below	1
it.	1
This	1
was	1
Borodino.	1
Below	1
the	1
village	1
the	1
road	1
crossed	1
the	1
river	1
by	1
a	1
bridge	1
and,	1
winding	1
down	1
and	1
up,	1
rose	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Valuevo	1
visible	1
about	1
four	1
miles	1
away,	1
where	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
then	1
stationed.	1
Beyond	1
Valuevo	1
the	1
road	1
disappeared	1
into	1
a	1
yellowing	1
forest	1
on	1
the	1
horizon.	1
Far	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
in	1
that	1
birch	1
and	1
fir	1
forest	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
belfry	1
of	1
the	1
Kolocha	1
Monastery	1
gleamed	1
in	1
the	1
sun.	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
blue	1
expanse,	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
the	1
road,	1
smoking	1
campfires	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
and	1
indefinite	1
masses	1
of	1
troops--ours	1
and	1
the	1
enemy's.	1
The	1
ground	1
to	1
the	1
right--along	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
Kolocha	1
and	1
Moskva	1
rivers--was	1
broken	1
and	1
hilly.	1
Between	1
the	1
hollows	1
the	1
villages	1
of	1
Bezubova	1
and	1
Zakharino	1
showed	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
On	1
the	1
left	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
more	1
level;	1
there	1
were	1
fields	1
of	1
grain,	1
and	1
the	1
smoking	1
ruins	1
of	1
Semenovsk,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
burned	1
down,	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
was	1
so	1
indefinite	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
left	1
nor	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
fully	1
satisfied	1
his	1
expectations.	1
Nowhere	1
could	1
he	1
see	1
the	1
battlefield	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
find,	1
but	1
only	1
fields,	1
meadows,	1
troops,	1
woods,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
campfires,	1
villages,	1
mounds,	1
and	1
streams;	1
and	1
try	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
could	1
descry	1
no	1
military	1
"position"	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
which	1
teemed	1
with	1
life,	1
nor	1
could	1
he	1
even	1
distinguish	1
our	1
troops	1
from	1
the	1
enemy's.	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
ask	1
someone	1
who	1
knows,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
addressed	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
was	1
looking	1
with	1
curiosity	1
at	1
his	1
huge	1
unmilitary	1
figure.	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
ask	1
you,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
"what	1
village	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
front?"	1
	1
"Burdino,	1
isn't	1
it?"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
companion.	1
	1
"Borodino,"	1
the	1
other	1
corrected	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
officer,	1
evidently	1
glad	1
of	1
an	1
opportunity	1
for	1
a	1
talk,	1
moved	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Are	1
those	1
our	1
men	1
there?"	1
Pierre	1
inquired.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
there,	1
further	1
on,	1
are	1
the	1
French,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer.	1
"There	1
they	1
are,	1
there...	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
them."	1
	1
"Where?	1
Where?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"One	1
can	1
see	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
eye...	1
Why,	1
there!"	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
pointed	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
smoke	1
visible	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
stern	1
and	1
serious	1
expression	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
noticed	1
on	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
faces	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
those	1
are	1
the	1
French!	1
And	1
over	1
there?..."	1
Pierre	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
knoll	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
near	1
which	1
some	1
troops	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
	1
"Those	1
are	1
ours."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
ours!	1
And	1
there?..."	1
Pierre	1
pointed	1
to	1
another	1
knoll	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
tree	1
on	1
it,	1
near	1
a	1
village	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
where	1
also	1
some	1
campfires	1
were	1
smoking	1
and	1
something	1
black	1
was	1
visible.	1
	1
"That's	1
his	1
again,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer.	1
(It	1
was	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt.)	1
"It	1
was	1
ours	1
yesterday,	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
his."	1
	1
"Then	1
how	1
about	1
our	1
position?"	1
	1
"Our	1
position?"	1
replied	1
the	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
satisfaction.	1
"I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
quite	1
clearly,	1
because	1
I	1
constructed	1
nearly	1
all	1
our	1
entrenchments.	1
There,	1
you	1
see?	1
There's	1
our	1
center,	1
at	1
Borodino,	1
just	1
there,"	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
church.	1
"That's	1
where	1
one	1
crosses	1
the	1
Kolocha.	1
You	1
see	1
down	1
there	1
where	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
hay	1
are	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
hollow,	1
there's	1
the	1
bridge.	1
That's	1
our	1
center.	1
Our	1
right	1
flank	1
is	1
over	1
there"--he	1
pointed	1
sharply	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
far	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
broken	1
ground--"That's	1
where	1
the	1
Moskva	1
River	1
is,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
thrown	1
up	1
three	1
redoubts	1
there,	1
very	1
strong	1
ones.	1
The	1
left	1
flank..."	1
here	1
the	1
officer	1
paused.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
that's	1
difficult	1
to	1
explain....	1
Yesterday	1
our	1
left	1
flank	1
was	1
there	1
at	1
Shevardino,	1
you	1
see,	1
where	1
the	1
oak	1
is,	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
have	1
withdrawn	1
our	1
left	1
wing--now	1
it	1
is	1
over	1
there,	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
village	1
and	1
the	1
smoke?	1
That's	1
Semenovsk,	1
yes,	1
there,"	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
Raevski's	1
knoll.	1
"But	1
the	1
battle	1
will	1
hardly	1
be	1
there.	1
His	1
having	1
moved	1
his	1
troops	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
ruse;	1
he	1
will	1
probably	1
pass	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
Moskva.	1
But	1
wherever	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
many	1
a	1
man	1
will	1
be	1
missing	1
tomorrow!"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
	1
An	1
elderly	1
sergeant	1
who	1
had	1
approached	1
the	1
officer	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
giving	1
these	1
explanations	1
had	1
waited	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
finish	1
speaking,	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
point,	1
evidently	1
not	1
liking	1
the	1
officer's	1
remark,	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Gabions	1
must	1
be	1
sent	1
for,"	1
said	1
he	1
sternly.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
appeared	1
abashed,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
one	1
might	1
think	1
of	1
how	1
many	1
men	1
would	1
be	1
missing	1
tomorrow	1
but	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"Well,	1
send	1
number	1
three	1
company	1
again,"	1
the	1
officer	1
replied	1
hurriedly.	1
	1
"And	1
you,	1
are	1
you	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doctors?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I've	1
come	1
on	1
my	1
own,"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
again,	1
passing	1
the	1
militiamen.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
those	1
damned	1
fellows!"	1
muttered	1
the	1
officer	1
who	1
followed	1
him,	1
holding	1
his	1
nose	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
past	1
the	1
men	1
at	1
work.	1
	1
"There	1
they	1
are...	1
bringing	1
her,	1
coming...	1
There	1
they	1
are...	1
They'll	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
minute..."	1
voices	1
were	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
saying;	1
and	1
officers,	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
militiamen	1
began	1
running	1
forward	1
along	1
the	1
road.	1
	1
A	1
church	1
procession	1
was	1
coming	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
from	1
Borodino.	1
First	1
along	1
the	1
dusty	1
road	1
came	1
the	1
infantry	1
in	1
ranks,	1
bareheaded	1
and	1
with	1
arms	1
reversed.	1
From	1
behind	1
them	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
church	1
singing.	1
	1
Soldiers	1
and	1
militiamen	1
ran	1
bareheaded	1
past	1
Pierre	1
toward	1
the	1
procession.	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
bringing	1
her,	1
our	1
Protectress!...	1
The	1
Iberian	1
Mother	1
of	1
God!"	1
someone	1
cried.	1
	1
"The	1
Smolensk	1
Mother	1
of	1
God,"	1
another	1
corrected	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
militiamen,	1
both	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
battery,	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
spades	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
church	1
procession.	1
Following	1
the	1
battalion	1
that	1
marched	1
along	1
the	1
dusty	1
road	1
came	1
priests	1
in	1
their	1
vestments--one	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
hood	1
with	1
attendants	1
and	1
singers.	1
Behind	1
them	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
bore	1
a	1
large,	1
dark-faced	1
icon	1
with	1
an	1
embossed	1
metal	1
cover.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
icon	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
had	1
since	1
accompanied	1
the	1
army.	1
Behind,	1
before,	1
and	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
crowds	1
of	1
militiamen	1
with	1
bared	1
heads	1
walked,	1
ran,	1
and	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
they	1
stopped	1
with	1
the	1
icon;	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
holding	1
it	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
linen	1
bands	1
attached	1
to	1
it	1
were	1
relieved	1
by	1
others,	1
the	1
chanters	1
relit	1
their	1
censers,	1
and	1
service	1
began.	1
The	1
hot	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
beat	1
down	1
vertically	1
and	1
a	1
fresh	1
soft	1
wind	1
played	1
with	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
the	1
bared	1
heads	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
ribbons	1
decorating	1
the	1
icon.	1
The	1
singing	1
did	1
not	1
sound	1
loud	1
under	1
the	1
open	1
sky.	1
An	1
immense	1
crowd	1
of	1
bareheaded	1
officers,	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
militiamen	1
surrounded	1
the	1
icon.	1
Behind	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
a	1
chanter	1
stood	1
the	1
notabilities	1
on	1
a	1
spot	1
reserved	1
for	1
them.	1
A	1
bald	1
general	1
with	1
a	1
St.	1
George's	1
Cross	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
stood	1
just	1
behind	1
the	1
priest's	1
back,	1
and	1
without	1
crossing	1
himself	1
(he	1
was	1
evidently	1
a	1
German)	1
patiently	1
awaited	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
service,	1
which	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
hear	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
probably	1
to	1
arouse	1
the	1
patriotism	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people.	1
Another	1
general	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
martial	1
pose,	1
crossing	1
himself	1
by	1
shaking	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
chest	1
while	1
looking	1
about	1
him.	1
Standing	1
among	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
peasants,	1
Pierre	1
recognized	1
several	1
acquaintances	1
among	1
these	1
notables,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
them--his	1
whole	1
attention	1
was	1
absorbed	1
in	1
watching	1
the	1
serious	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
soldiers	1
and	1
militiamen	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
gazing	1
eagerly	1
at	1
the	1
icon.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
tired	1
chanters,	1
who	1
were	1
singing	1
the	1
service	1
for	1
the	1
twentieth	1
time	1
that	1
day,	1
began	1
lazily	1
and	1
mechanically	1
to	1
sing:	1
"Save	1
from	1
calamity	1
Thy	1
servants,	1
O	1
Mother	1
of	1
God,"	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
deacon	1
chimed	1
in:	1
"For	1
to	1
Thee	1
under	1
God	1
we	1
all	1
flee	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
inviolable	1
bulwark	1
and	1
protection,"	1
there	1
again	1
kindled	1
in	1
all	1
those	1
faces	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
moment	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
at	1
Mozhaysk	1
and	1
momentarily	1
on	1
many	1
and	1
many	1
faces	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
that	1
morning;	1
and	1
heads	1
were	1
bowed	1
more	1
frequently	1
and	1
hair	1
tossed	1
back,	1
and	1
sighs	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
men	1
made	1
as	1
they	1
crossed	1
themselves	1
were	1
heard.	1
	1
The	1
crowd	1
round	1
the	1
icon	1
suddenly	1
parted	1
and	1
pressed	1
against	1
Pierre.	1
Someone,	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
personage	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
haste	1
with	1
which	1
way	1
was	1
made	1
for	1
him,	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
icon.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
riding	1
round	1
the	1
position	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
Tatarinova	1
had	1
stopped	1
where	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
being	1
held.	1
Pierre	1
recognized	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
his	1
peculiar	1
figure,	1
which	1
distinguished	1
him	1
from	1
everybody	1
else.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
long	1
overcoat	1
on	1
his	1
exceedingly	1
stout,	1
round-shouldered	1
body,	1
with	1
uncovered	1
white	1
head	1
and	1
puffy	1
face	1
showing	1
the	1
white	1
ball	1
of	1
the	1
eye	1
he	1
had	1
lost,	1
Kutuzov	1
walked	1
with	1
plunging,	1
swaying	1
gait	1
into	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
stopped	1
behind	1
the	1
priest.	1
He	1
crossed	1
himself	1
with	1
an	1
accustomed	1
movement,	1
bent	1
till	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
white	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh.	1
Behind	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
the	1
suite.	1
Despite	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
who	1
attracted	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
superior	1
officers,	1
the	1
militiamen	1
and	1
soldiers	1
continued	1
their	1
prayers	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
over,	1
Kutuzov	1
stepped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
icon,	1
sank	1
heavily	1
to	1
his	1
knees,	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
tried	1
vainly	1
to	1
rise,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
weakness	1
and	1
weight.	1
His	1
white	1
head	1
twitched	1
with	1
the	1
effort.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
rose,	1
kissed	1
the	1
icon	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
does	1
with	1
naively	1
pouting	1
lips,	1
and	1
again	1
bowed	1
till	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
other	1
generals	1
followed	1
his	1
example,	1
then	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
after	1
them	1
with	1
excited	1
faces,	1
pressing	1
on	1
one	1
another,	1
crowding,	1
panting,	1
and	1
pushing,	1
scrambled	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
militiamen.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XXII	1
	1
Staggering	1
amid	1
the	1
crush,	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
"Count	1
Peter	1
Kirilovich!	1
How	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
here?"	1
said	1
a	1
voice.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
round.	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy,	1
brushing	1
his	1
knees	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
(he	1
had	1
probably	1
soiled	1
them	1
when	1
he,	1
too,	1
had	1
knelt	1
before	1
the	1
icon),	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
smiling.	1
Boris	1
was	1
elegantly	1
dressed,	1
with	1
a	1
slightly	1
martial	1
touch	1
appropriate	1
to	1
a	1
campaign.	1
He	1
wore	1
a	1
long	1
coat	1
and	1
like	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
a	1
whip	1
slung	1
across	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
seated	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
house,	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
which	1
one	1
Cossack	1
had	1
run	1
to	1
fetch	1
and	1
another	1
had	1
hastily	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
rug.	1
An	1
immense	1
and	1
brilliant	1
suite	1
surrounded	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
icon	1
was	1
carried	1
further,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
throng.	1
Pierre	1
stopped	1
some	1
thirty	1
paces	1
from	1
Kutuzov,	1
talking	1
to	1
Boris.	1
	1
He	1
explained	1
his	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
position.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
must	1
do,"	1
said	1
Boris.	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
honors	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
you.	1
You	1
will	1
see	1
everything	1
best	1
from	1
where	1
Count	1
Bennigsen	1
will	1
be.	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
him,	1
you	1
know;	1
I'll	1
mention	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
ride	1
round	1
the	1
position,	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
us.	1
We	1
are	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
flank.	1
Then	1
when	1
we	1
get	1
back,	1
do	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
we'll	1
arrange	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
cards.	1
Of	1
course	1
you	1
know	1
Dmitri	1
Sergeevich?	1
Those	1
are	1
his	1
quarters,"	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Gorki.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
right	1
flank.	1
They	1
say	1
it's	1
very	1
strong,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
start	1
from	1
the	1
Moskva	1
River	1
and	1
ride	1
round	1
the	1
whole	1
position."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
that	1
later,	1
but	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
left	1
flank."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes.	1
But	1
where	1
is	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski's	1
regiment?	1
Can	1
you	1
point	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
me?"	1
	1
"Prince	1
Andrew's?	1
We	1
shall	1
pass	1
it	1
and	1
I'll	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
him."	1
	1
"What	1
about	1
the	1
left	1
flank?"	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
	1
"To	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
between	1
ourselves,	1
God	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
state	1
our	1
left	1
flank	1
is	1
in,"	1
said	1
Boris	1
confidentially	1
lowering	1
his	1
voice.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
Count	1
Bennigsen	1
intended.	1
He	1
meant	1
to	1
fortify	1
that	1
knoll	1
quite	1
differently,	1
but..."	1
Boris	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
"his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
it,	1
or	1
someone	1
persuaded	1
him.	1
You	1
see..."	1
but	1
Boris	1
did	1
not	1
finish,	1
for	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Kaysarov,	1
Kutuzov's	1
adjutant,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"Ah,	1
Kaysarov!"	1
said	1
Boris,	1
addressing	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
unembarrassed	1
smile,	1
"I	1
was	1
just	1
trying	1
to	1
explain	1
our	1
position	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
It	1
is	1
amazing	1
how	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
could	1
so	1
foresee	1
the	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
French!"	1
	1
"You	1
mean	1
the	1
left	1
flank?"	1
asked	1
Kaysarov.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
exactly;	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
is	1
now	1
extremely	1
strong."	1
	1
Though	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
dismissed	1
all	1
unnecessary	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
staff,	1
Boris	1
had	1
contrived	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
headquarters	1
after	1
the	1
changes.	1
He	1
had	1
established	1
himself	1
with	1
Count	1
Bennigsen,	1
who,	1
like	1
all	1
on	1
whom	1
Boris	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
attendance,	1
considered	1
young	1
Prince	1
Drubetskoy	1
an	1
invaluable	1
man.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
higher	1
command	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
sharply	1
defined	1
parties:	1
Kutuzov's	1
party	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
Bennigsen,	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
staff.	1
Boris	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else,	1
while	1
showing	1
servile	1
respect	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
could	1
so	1
create	1
an	1
impression	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
fellow	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
good	1
and	1
that	1
Bennigsen	1
managed	1
everything.	1
Now	1
the	1
decisive	1
moment	1
of	1
battle	1
had	1
come	1
when	1
Kutuzov	1
would	1
be	1
destroyed	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
pass	1
to	1
Bennigsen,	1
or	1
even	1
if	1
Kutuzov	1
won	1
the	1
battle	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
Bennigsen.	1
In	1
any	1
case	1
many	1
great	1
rewards	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
for	1
tomorrow's	1
action,	1
and	1
new	1
men	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
front.	1
So	1
Boris	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
nervous	1
vivacity	1
all	1
day.	1
	1
After	1
Kaysarov,	1
others	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
questions	1
about	1
Moscow	1
that	1
were	1
showered	1
upon	1
him,	1
or	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
told	1
him.	1
The	1
faces	1
all	1
expressed	1
animation	1
and	1
apprehension,	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
excitement	1
shown	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
faces	1
lay	1
chiefly	1
in	1
questions	1
of	1
personal	1
success;	1
his	1
mind,	1
however,	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
different	1
expression	1
he	1
saw	1
on	1
other	1
faces--an	1
expression	1
that	1
spoke	1
not	1
of	1
personal	1
matters	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
universal	1
questions	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death.	1
Kutuzov	1
noticed	1
Pierre's	1
figure	1
and	1
the	1
group	1
gathered	1
round	1
him.	1
	1
"Call	1
him	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
An	1
adjutant	1
told	1
Pierre	1
of	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness'	1
wish,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
went	1
toward	1
Kutuzov's	1
bench.	1
But	1
a	1
militiaman	1
got	1
there	1
before	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
that	1
fellow	1
get	1
here?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
creature	1
that	1
wriggles	1
in	1
anywhere!"	1
was	1
the	1
answer.	1
"He	1
has	1
been	1
degraded,	1
you	1
know.	1
Now	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
bob	1
up	1
again.	1
He's	1
been	1
proposing	1
some	1
scheme	1
or	1
other	1
and	1
has	1
crawled	1
into	1
the	1
enemy's	1
picket	1
line	1
at	1
night....	1
He's	1
a	1
brave	1
fellow."	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
bowed	1
respectfully	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"I	1
concluded	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
reported	1
to	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
you	1
might	1
send	1
me	1
away	1
or	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
reporting,	1
but	1
then	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
lose	1
anything..."	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes."	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
right,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
rendering	1
a	1
service	1
to	1
my	1
Fatherland	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
die."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes."	1
	1
"And	1
should	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
require	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
spare	1
his	1
skin,	1
please	1
think	1
of	1
me....	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
may	1
prove	1
useful	1
to	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness."	1
	1
"Yes...	1
Yes..."	1
Kutuzov	1
repeated,	1
his	1
laughing	1
eye	1
narrowing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
Boris,	1
with	1
his	1
courtierlike	1
adroitness,	1
stepped	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
side	1
near	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
natural	1
manner,	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
voice,	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
as	1
though	1
continuing	1
an	1
interrupted	1
conversation:	1
	1
"The	1
militia	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
clean	1
white	1
shirts	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
die.	1
What	1
heroism,	1
Count!"	1
	1
Boris	1
evidently	1
said	1
this	1
to	1
Pierre	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
overheard	1
by	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness.	1
He	1
knew	1
Kutuzov's	1
attention	1
would	1
be	1
caught	1
by	1
those	1
words,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
saying	1
about	1
the	1
militia?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
	1
"Preparing	1
for	1
tomorrow,	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness--for	1
death--they	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
clean	1
shirts."	1
	1
"Ah...	1
a	1
wonderful,	1
a	1
matchless	1
people!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov;	1
and	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
swayed	1
his	1
head.	1
"A	1
matchless	1
people!"	1
he	1
repeated	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
smell	1
gunpowder?"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smell.	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
wife's	1
adorers.	1
Is	1
she	1
well?	1
My	1
quarters	1
are	1
at	1
your	1
service."	1
	1
And	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
with	1
old	1
people,	1
Kutuzov	1
began	1
looking	1
about	1
absent-mindedly	1
as	1
if	1
forgetting	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
do.	1
	1
Then,	1
evidently	1
remembering	1
what	1
he	1
wanted,	1
he	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Andrew	1
Kaysarov,	1
his	1
adjutant's	1
brother.	1
	1
"Those	1
verses...	1
those	1
verses	1
of	1
Marin's...	1
how	1
do	1
they	1
go,	1
eh?	1
Those	1
he	1
wrote	1
about	1
Gerakov:	1
'Lectures	1
for	1
the	1
corps	1
inditing'...	1
Recite	1
them,	1
recite	1
them!"	1
said	1
he,	1
evidently	1
preparing	1
to	1
laugh.	1
	1
Kaysarov	1
recited....	1
Kutuzov	1
smilingly	1
nodded	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
rhythm	1
of	1
the	1
verses.	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
had	1
left	1
Kutuzov,	1
Dolokhov	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
here,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
said	1
aloud,	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
strangers	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
particularly	1
resolute	1
and	1
solemn	1
tone.	1
"On	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
God	1
alone	1
knows	1
who	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
fated	1
to	1
survive,	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
this	1
opportunity	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
regret	1
the	1
misunderstandings	1
that	1
occurred	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
should	1
wish	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
ill	1
feeling	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
forgive	1
me."	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him.	1
With	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
Dolokhov	1
embraced	1
Pierre	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
Boris	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
his	1
general,	1
and	1
Count	1
Bennigsen	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
proposed	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
ride	1
with	1
him	1
along	1
the	1
line.	1
	1
"It	1
will	1
interest	1
you,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
very	1
much,"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
Kutuzov	1
left	1
for	1
Tatarinova,	1
and	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
his	1
suite,	1
with	1
Pierre	1
among	1
them,	1
set	1
out	1
on	1
their	1
ride	1
along	1
the	1
line.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIII	1
	1
From	1
Gorki,	1
Bennigsen	1
descended	1
the	1
highroad	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
hill,	1
the	1
officer	1
had	1
pointed	1
out	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
our	1
position	1
and	1
where	1
rows	1
of	1
fragrant	1
new-mown	1
hay	1
lay	1
by	1
the	1
riverside.	1
They	1
rode	1
across	1
that	1
bridge	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
thence	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
passing	1
an	1
enormous	1
number	1
of	1
troops	1
and	1
guns,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
high	1
knoll	1
where	1
militiamen	1
were	1
digging.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
redoubt,	1
as	1
yet	1
unnamed,	1
which	1
afterwards	1
became	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
Raevski	1
Redoubt,	1
or	1
the	1
Knoll	1
Battery,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
paid	1
no	1
special	1
attention	1
to	1
it.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
become	1
more	1
memorable	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
spot	1
on	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
	1
They	1
then	1
crossed	1
the	1
hollow	1
to	1
Semenovsk,	1
where	1
the	1
soldiers	1
were	1
dragging	1
away	1
the	1
last	1
logs	1
from	1
the	1
huts	1
and	1
barns.	1
Then	1
they	1
rode	1
downhill	1
and	1
uphill,	1
across	1
a	1
ryefield	1
trodden	1
and	1
beaten	1
down	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
hail,	1
following	1
a	1
track	1
freshly	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
artillery	1
over	1
the	1
furrows	1
of	1
the	1
plowed	1
land,	1
and	1
reached	1
some	1
fleches	1
*	1
which	1
were	1
still	1
being	1
dug.	1
	1
	1
*	1
A	1
kind	1
of	1
entrenchment.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
fleches	1
Bennigsen	1
stopped	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
opposite,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
ours	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
where	1
several	1
horsemen	1
could	1
be	1
descried.	1
The	1
officers	1
said	1
that	1
either	1
Napoleon	1
or	1
Murat	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
gazed	1
eagerly	1
at	1
this	1
little	1
group	1
of	1
horsemen.	1
Pierre	1
also	1
looked	1
at	1
them,	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
scarcely	1
discernible	1
figures	1
was	1
Napoleon.	1
At	1
last	1
those	1
mounted	1
men	1
rode	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
mound	1
and	1
disappeared.	1
	1
Bennigsen	1
spoke	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
approached	1
him,	1
and	1
began	1
explaining	1
the	1
whole	1
position	1
of	1
our	1
troops.	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
him,	1
straining	1
each	1
faculty	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
essential	1
points	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
battle,	1
but	1
was	1
mortified	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
his	1
mental	1
capacity	1
was	1
inadequate	1
for	1
the	1
task.	1
He	1
could	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
it.	1
Bennigsen	1
stopped	1
speaking	1
and,	1
noticing	1
that	1
Pierre	1
was	1
listening,	1
suddenly	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
this	1
interests	1
you?"	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary	1
it's	1
very	1
interesting!"	1
replied	1
Pierre	1
not	1
quite	1
truthfully.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
fleches	1
they	1
rode	1
still	1
farther	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
along	1
a	1
road	1
winding	1
through	1
a	1
thick,	1
low-growing	1
birch	1
wood.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
a	1
brown	1
hare	1
with	1
white	1
feet	1
sprang	1
out	1
and,	1
scared	1
by	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
horses,	1
grew	1
so	1
confused	1
that	1
it	1
leaped	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
arousing	1
general	1
attention	1
and	1
laughter,	1
and	1
only	1
when	1
several	1
voices	1
shouted	1
at	1
it	1
did	1
it	1
dart	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
disappear	1
in	1
the	1
thicket.	1
After	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
for	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
glade	1
where	1
troops	1
of	1
Tuchkov's	1
corps	1
were	1
stationed	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
left	1
flank.	1
	1
Here,	1
at	1
the	1
extreme	1
left	1
flank,	1
Bennigsen	1
talked	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
heat,	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
gave	1
orders	1
of	1
great	1
military	1
importance.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
Tuchkov's	1
troops	1
was	1
some	1
high	1
ground	1
not	1
occupied	1
by	1
troops.	1
Bennigsen	1
loudly	1
criticized	1
this	1
mistake,	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
madness	1
to	1
leave	1
a	1
height	1
which	1
commanded	1
the	1
country	1
around	1
unoccupied	1
and	1
to	1
place	1
troops	1
below	1
it.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
expressed	1
the	1
same	1
opinion.	1
One	1
in	1
particular	1
declared	1
with	1
martial	1
heat	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
there	1
to	1
be	1
slaughtered.	1
Bennigsen	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
authority	1
ordered	1
the	1
troops	1
to	1
occupy	1
the	1
high	1
ground.	1
This	1
disposition	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
increased	1
Pierre's	1
doubt	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
capacity	1
to	1
understand	1
military	1
matters.	1
Listening	1
to	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
the	1
generals	1
criticizing	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
behind	1
the	1
hill,	1
he	1
quite	1
understood	1
them	1
and	1
shared	1
their	1
opinion,	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
how	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
put	1
them	1
there	1
behind	1
the	1
hill	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
so	1
gross	1
and	1
palpable	1
a	1
blunder.	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
troops	1
were	1
not,	1
as	1
Bennigsen	1
supposed,	1
put	1
there	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
position,	1
but	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
concealed	1
position	1
as	1
an	1
ambush,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
and	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
strike	1
an	1
approaching	1
enemy	1
unexpectedly.	1
Bennigsen	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
this	1
and	1
moved	1
the	1
troops	1
forward	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
ideas	1
without	1
mentioning	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIV	1
	1
On	1
that	1
bright	1
evening	1
of	1
August	1
25,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lay	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
in	1
a	1
broken-down	1
shed	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Knyazkovo	1
at	1
the	1
further	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
regiment's	1
encampment.	1
Through	1
a	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
broken	1
wall	1
he	1
could	1
see,	1
beside	1
the	1
wooden	1
fence,	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
thirty	1
year-old	1
birches	1
with	1
their	1
lower	1
branches	1
lopped	1
off,	1
a	1
field	1
on	1
which	1
shocks	1
of	1
oats	1
were	1
standing,	1
and	1
some	1
bushes	1
near	1
which	1
rose	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
campfires--	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
kitchens.	1
	1
Narrow	1
and	1
burdensome	1
and	1
useless	1
to	1
anyone	1
as	1
his	1
life	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
battle	1
felt	1
agitated	1
and	1
irritable	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
seven	1
years	1
before	1
at	1
Austerlitz.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
received	1
and	1
given	1
the	1
orders	1
for	1
next	1
day's	1
battle	1
and	1
had	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do.	1
But	1
his	1
thoughts--the	1
simplest,	1
clearest,	1
and	1
therefore	1
most	1
terrible	1
thoughts--would	1
give	1
him	1
no	1
peace.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
tomorrow's	1
battle	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
death	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him--not	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
any	1
worldly	1
matter	1
or	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
its	1
effect	1
on	1
others,	1
but	1
simply	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
himself,	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
soul--vividly,	1
plainly,	1
terribly,	1
and	1
almost	1
as	1
a	1
certainty.	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
this	1
perception	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
previously	1
tormented	1
and	1
preoccupied	1
him	1
suddenly	1
became	1
illumined	1
by	1
a	1
cold	1
white	1
light	1
without	1
shadows,	1
without	1
perspective,	1
without	1
distinction	1
of	1
outline.	1
All	1
life	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
magic-lantern	1
pictures	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
gazing	1
by	1
artificial	1
light	1
through	1
a	1
glass.	1
Now	1
he	1
suddenly	1
saw	1
those	1
badly	1
daubed	1
pictures	1
in	1
clear	1
daylight	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
glass.	1
"Yes,	1
yes!	1
There	1
they	1
are,	1
those	1
false	1
images	1
that	1
agitated,	1
enraptured,	1
and	1
tormented	1
me,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
passing	1
in	1
review	1
the	1
principal	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
magic	1
lantern	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
regarding	1
them	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
white	1
daylight	1
of	1
his	1
clear	1
perception	1
of	1
death.	1
"There	1
they	1
are,	1
those	1
rudely	1
painted	1
figures	1
that	1
once	1
seemed	1
splendid	1
and	1
mysterious.	1
Glory,	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
society,	1
love	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
the	1
Fatherland	1
itself--how	1
important	1
these	1
pictures	1
appeared	1
to	1
me,	1
with	1
what	1
profound	1
meaning	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
filled!	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
so	1
simple,	1
pale,	1
and	1
crude	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
white	1
light	1
of	1
this	1
morning	1
which	1
I	1
feel	1
is	1
dawning	1
for	1
me."	1
The	1
three	1
great	1
sorrows	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
held	1
his	1
attention	1
in	1
particular:	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
woman,	1
his	1
father's	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
invasion	1
which	1
had	1
overrun	1
half	1
Russia.	1
"Love...	1
that	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
brimming	1
over	1
with	1
mystic	1
forces!	1
Yes,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
loved	1
her.	1
I	1
made	1
romantic	1
plans	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
happiness	1
with	1
her!	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
boy	1
I	1
was!"	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
bitterly.	1
"Ah	1
me!	1
I	1
believed	1
in	1
some	1
ideal	1
love	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
faithful	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
year	1
of	1
my	1
absence!	1
Like	1
the	1
gentle	1
dove	1
in	1
the	1
fable	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
pine	1
apart	1
from	1
me....	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
much	1
simpler	1
really....	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
horrible."	1
	1
"When	1
my	1
father	1
built	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
his:	1
his	1
land,	1
his	1
air,	1
his	1
peasants.	1
But	1
Napoleon	1
came	1
and	1
swept	1
him	1
aside,	1
unconscious	1
of	1
his	1
existence,	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
brush	1
a	1
chip	1
from	1
his	1
path,	1
and	1
his	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
fell	1
to	1
pieces.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
trial	1
sent	1
from	1
above.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
trial	1
for,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
and	1
will	1
never	1
return?	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
here!	1
For	1
whom	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
trial	1
intended?	1
The	1
Fatherland,	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow!	1
And	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
killed,	1
perhaps	1
not	1
even	1
by	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
but	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
men,	1
by	1
a	1
soldier	1
discharging	1
a	1
musket	1
close	1
to	1
my	1
ear	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
did	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
me	1
by	1
head	1
and	1
heels	1
and	1
fling	1
me	1
into	1
a	1
hole	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
stink	1
under	1
their	1
noses,	1
and	1
new	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
will	1
arise,	1
which	1
will	1
seem	1
quite	1
ordinary	1
to	1
others	1
and	1
about	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
nothing.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
exist..."	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
row	1
of	1
birches	1
shining	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine,	1
with	1
their	1
motionless	1
green	1
and	1
yellow	1
foliage	1
and	1
white	1
bark.	1
"To	1
die...	1
to	1
be	1
killed	1
tomorrow...	1
That	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
exist...	1
That	1
all	1
this	1
should	1
still	1
be,	1
but	1
no	1
me...."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
birches	1
with	1
their	1
light	1
and	1
shade,	1
the	1
curly	1
clouds,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
campfires,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
around	1
him	1
changed	1
and	1
seemed	1
terrible	1
and	1
menacing.	1
A	1
cold	1
shiver	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
spine.	1
He	1
rose	1
quickly,	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
about.	1
	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
returned,	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
outside	1
the	1
shed.	1
"Who's	1
that?"	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
The	1
red-nosed	1
Captain	1
Timokhin,	1
formerly	1
Dolokhov's	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
but	1
now	1
from	1
lack	1
of	1
officers	1
a	1
battalion	1
commander,	1
shyly	1
entered	1
the	1
shed	1
followed	1
by	1
an	1
adjutant	1
and	1
the	1
regimental	1
paymaster.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rose	1
hastily,	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
about,	1
gave	1
them	1
some	1
further	1
instructions,	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
dismiss	1
them	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
familiar,	1
lisping,	1
voice	1
behind	1
the	1
shed.	1
	1
"Devil	1
take	1
it!"	1
said	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
stumbling	1
over	1
something.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
and	1
saw	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
tripped	1
over	1
a	1
pole	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
had	1
nearly	1
fallen,	1
coming	1
his	1
way.	1
It	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
meet	1
people	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
set	1
in	1
general,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
especially,	1
for	1
he	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
painful	1
moments	1
of	1
his	1
last	1
visit	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"You?	1
What	1
a	1
surprise!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"What	1
brings	1
you	1
here?	1
This	1
is	1
unexpected!"	1
	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
face	1
expressed	1
more	1
than	1
coldness--they	1
expressed	1
hostility,	1
which	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
at	1
once.	1
He	1
had	1
approached	1
the	1
shed	1
full	1
of	1
animation,	1
but	1
on	1
seeing	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
he	1
felt	1
constrained	1
and	1
ill	1
at	1
ease.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
come...	1
simply...	1
you	1
know...	1
come...	1
it	1
interests	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
that	1
day	1
senselessly	1
repeated	1
that	1
word	1
"interesting."	1
"I	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
battle."	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
the	1
masonic	1
brothers	1
say	1
about	1
war?	1
How	1
would	1
they	1
stop	1
it?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sarcastically.	1
"Well,	1
and	1
how's	1
Moscow?	1
And	1
my	1
people?	1
Have	1
they	1
reached	1
Moscow	1
at	1
last?"	1
he	1
asked	1
seriously.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
have.	1
Julie	1
Drubetskaya	1
told	1
me	1
so.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
but	1
missed	1
them.	1
They	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
your	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow."	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XXV	1
	1
The	1
officers	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
take	1
leave,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
apparently	1
reluctant	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
friend,	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
stay	1
and	1
have	1
tea.	1
Seats	1
were	1
brought	1
in	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
the	1
tea.	1
The	1
officers	1
gazed	1
with	1
surprise	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
huge	1
stout	1
figure	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
talk	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
our	1
army,	1
round	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
ridden.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
remained	1
silent,	1
and	1
his	1
expression	1
was	1
so	1
forbidding	1
that	1
Pierre	1
addressed	1
his	1
remarks	1
chiefly	1
to	1
the	1
good-natured	1
battalion	1
commander.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
understand	1
the	1
whole	1
position	1
of	1
our	1
troops?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes--that	1
is,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Not	1
being	1
a	1
military	1
man	1
I	1
can't	1
say	1
I	1
have	1
understood	1
it	1
fully,	1
but	1
I	1
understand	1
the	1
general	1
position."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
know	1
more	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,	1
be	1
it	1
who	1
it	1
may,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
in	1
perplexity	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Well,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
appointment?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
his	1
appointment,	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
know,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"And	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly.	1
In	1
Moscow	1
they	1
are	1
saying	1
heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
about	1
him....	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
him?"	1
	1
"Ask	1
them,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
indicating	1
the	1
officers.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
Timokhin	1
with	1
the	1
condescendingly	1
interrogative	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
everybody	1
involuntarily	1
addressed	1
that	1
officer.	1
	1
"We	1
see	1
light	1
again,	1
since	1
his	1
Serenity	1
has	1
been	1
appointed,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
Timokhin	1
timidly,	1
and	1
continually	1
turning	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
his	1
colonel.	1
	1
"Why	1
so?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Well,	1
to	1
mention	1
only	1
firewood	1
and	1
fodder,	1
let	1
me	1
inform	1
you.	1
Why,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
retreating	1
from	1
Sventsyani	1
we	1
dare	1
not	1
touch	1
a	1
stick	1
or	1
a	1
wisp	1
of	1
hay	1
or	1
anything.	1
You	1
see,	1
we	1
were	1
going	1
away,	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
get	1
it	1
all;	1
wasn't	1
it	1
so,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
and	1
again	1
Timokhin	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
prince.	1
"But	1
we	1
daren't.	1
In	1
our	1
regiment	1
two	1
officers	1
were	1
court-martialed	1
for	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
thing.	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
Serenity	1
took	1
command	1
everything	1
became	1
straight	1
forward.	1
Now	1
we	1
see	1
light..."	1
	1
"Then	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
forbidden?"	1
	1
Timokhin	1
looked	1
about	1
in	1
confusion,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
or	1
how	1
to	1
answer	1
such	1
a	1
question.	1
Pierre	1
put	1
the	1
same	1
question	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Why,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
lay	1
waste	1
the	1
country	1
we	1
were	1
abandoning	1
to	1
the	1
enemy,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
venomous	1
irony.	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
sound:	1
one	1
can't	1
permit	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
be	1
pillaged	1
and	1
accustom	1
the	1
troops	1
to	1
marauding.	1
At	1
Smolensk	1
too	1
he	1
judged	1
correctly	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
might	1
outflank	1
us,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
larger	1
forces.	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
this,"	1
cried	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
a	1
shrill	1
voice	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
escape	1
him	1
involuntarily:	1
"he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
there,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
we	1
were	1
fighting	1
for	1
Russian	1
soil,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
men	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before,	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
held	1
the	1
French	1
for	1
two	1
days,	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
success	1
had	1
increased	1
our	1
strength	1
tenfold.	1
He	1
ordered	1
us	1
to	1
retreat,	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
efforts	1
and	1
losses	1
went	1
for	1
nothing.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
thought	1
of	1
betraying	1
us,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
best	1
he	1
could,	1
he	1
thought	1
out	1
everything,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
he	1
is	1
unsuitable.	1
He	1
is	1
unsuitable	1
now,	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
plans	1
out	1
everything	1
very	1
thoroughly	1
and	1
accurately	1
as	1
every	1
German	1
has	1
to.	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
explain?...	1
Well,	1
say	1
your	1
father	1
has	1
a	1
German	1
valet,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
splendid	1
valet	1
and	1
satisfies	1
your	1
father's	1
requirements	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
could,	1
then	1
it's	1
all	1
right	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
serve.	1
But	1
if	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
mortally	1
sick	1
you'll	1
send	1
the	1
valet	1
away	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
your	1
father	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
unpracticed,	1
awkward	1
hands,	1
and	1
will	1
soothe	1
him	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
skilled	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
stranger	1
could.	1
So	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
with	1
Barclay.	1
While	1
Russia	1
was	1
well,	1
a	1
foreigner	1
could	1
serve	1
her	1
and	1
be	1
a	1
splendid	1
minister;	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
she	1
needs	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
kin.	1
But	1
in	1
your	1
club	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
him	1
out	1
a	1
traitor!	1
They	1
slander	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
traitor,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
result	1
will	1
be	1
that	1
afterwards,	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
false	1
accusations,	1
they	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
out	1
a	1
hero	1
or	1
a	1
genius	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
traitor,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
more	1
unjust.	1
He	1
is	1
an	1
honest	1
and	1
very	1
punctilious	1
German."	1
	1
"And	1
they	1
say	1
he's	1
a	1
skillful	1
commander,"	1
rejoined	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
what	1
is	1
meant	1
by	1
'a	1
skillful	1
commander,'"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
ironically.	1
	1
"A	1
skillful	1
commander?"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
"Why,	1
one	1
who	1
foresees	1
all	1
contingencies...	1
and	1
foresees	1
the	1
adversary's	1
intentions."	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
impossible,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
matter	1
settled	1
long	1
ago.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
surprise.	1
	1
"And	1
yet	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
war	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
chess?"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"but	1
with	1
this	1
little	1
difference,	1
that	1
in	1
chess	1
you	1
may	1
think	1
over	1
each	1
move	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
limited	1
for	1
time,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
difference	1
too,	1
that	1
a	1
knight	1
is	1
always	1
stronger	1
than	1
a	1
pawn,	1
and	1
two	1
pawns	1
are	1
always	1
stronger	1
than	1
one,	1
while	1
in	1
war	1
a	1
battalion	1
is	1
sometimes	1
stronger	1
than	1
a	1
division	1
and	1
sometimes	1
weaker	1
than	1
a	1
company.	1
The	1
relative	1
strength	1
of	1
bodies	1
of	1
troops	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
anyone.	1
Believe	1
me,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
"if	1
things	1
depended	1
on	1
arrangements	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
staff,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
there	1
making	1
arrangements,	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
serve	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
with	1
these	1
gentlemen,	1
and	1
I	1
consider	1
that	1
on	1
us	1
tomorrow's	1
battle	1
will	1
depend	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
those	1
others....	1
Success	1
never	1
depends,	1
and	1
never	1
will	1
depend,	1
on	1
position,	1
or	1
equipment,	1
or	1
even	1
on	1
numbers,	1
and	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
on	1
position."	1
	1
"But	1
on	1
what	1
then?"	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
in	1
him,"	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
Timokhin,	1
"and	1
in	1
each	1
soldier."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
glanced	1
at	1
Timokhin,	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
commander	1
in	1
alarm	1
and	1
bewilderment.	1
In	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
reticent	1
taciturnity	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
now	1
seemed	1
excited.	1
He	1
could	1
apparently	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
expressing	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
suddenly	1
occurred	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"A	1
battle	1
is	1
won	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
firmly	1
resolve	1
to	1
win	1
it!	1
Why	1
did	1
we	1
lose	1
the	1
battle	1
at	1
Austerlitz?	1
The	1
French	1
losses	1
were	1
almost	1
equal	1
to	1
ours,	1
but	1
very	1
early	1
we	1
said	1
to	1
ourselves	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
losing	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
lose	1
it.	1
And	1
we	1
said	1
so	1
because	1
we	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
there,	1
we	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
battlefield	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
could.	1
'We've	1
lost,	1
so	1
let	1
us	1
run,'	1
and	1
we	1
ran.	1
If	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
said	1
that	1
till	1
the	1
evening,	1
heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
happened.	1
But	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
shan't	1
say	1
it!	1
You	1
talk	1
about	1
our	1
position,	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
weak	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
too	1
extended,"	1
he	1
went	1
on.	1
"That's	1
all	1
nonsense,	1
there's	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
But	1
what	1
awaits	1
us	1
tomorrow?	1
A	1
hundred	1
million	1
most	1
diverse	1
chances	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
decided	1
on	1
the	1
instant	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
our	1
men	1
or	1
theirs	1
run	1
or	1
do	1
not	1
run,	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
or	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
killed,	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
being	1
done	1
at	1
present	1
is	1
only	1
play.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
those	1
men	1
with	1
whom	1
you	1
have	1
ridden	1
round	1
the	1
position	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
not	1
help	1
matters,	1
but	1
hinder.	1
They	1
are	1
only	1
concerned	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
petty	1
interests."	1
	1
"At	1
such	1
a	1
moment?"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"At	1
such	1
a	1
moment!"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
repeated.	1
"To	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
moment	1
affording	1
opportunities	1
to	1
undermine	1
a	1
rival	1
and	1
obtain	1
an	1
extra	1
cross	1
or	1
ribbon.	1
For	1
me	1
tomorrow	1
means	1
this:	1
a	1
Russian	1
army	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
and	1
a	1
French	1
army	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
have	1
met	1
to	1
fight,	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
that	1
these	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
will	1
fight	1
and	1
the	1
side	1
that	1
fights	1
more	1
fiercely	1
and	1
spares	1
itself	1
least	1
will	1
win.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
whatever	1
happens	1
and	1
whatever	1
muddles	1
those	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
may	1
make,	1
we	1
shall	1
win	1
tomorrow's	1
battle.	1
Tomorrow,	1
happen	1
what	1
may,	1
we	1
shall	1
win!"	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
your	1
excellency!	1
That's	1
the	1
truth,	1
the	1
real	1
truth,"	1
said	1
Timokhin.	1
"Who	1
would	1
spare	1
himself	1
now?	1
The	1
soldiers	1
in	1
my	1
battalion,	1
believe	1
me,	1
wouldn't	1
drink	1
their	1
vodka!	1
'It's	1
not	1
the	1
day	1
for	1
that!'	1
they	1
say."	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
The	1
officers	1
rose.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
with	1
them,	1
giving	1
final	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
After	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
Pierre	1
approached	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
three	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
shed,	1
and	1
looking	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
recognized	1
Wolzogen	1
and	1
Clausewitz	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
They	1
rode	1
close	1
by	1
continuing	1
to	1
converse,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
involuntarily	1
heard	1
these	1
words:	1
	1
"Der	1
Krieg	1
muss	1
in	1
Raum	1
verlegt	1
werden.	1
Der	1
Ansicht	1
kann	1
ich	1
nicht	1
genug	1
Preis	1
geben,"	1
*	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"The	1
war	1
must	1
be	1
extended	1
widely.	1
I	1
cannot	1
sufficiently	1
commend	1
that	1
view."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
ja,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
"der	1
Zweck	1
ist	1
nur	1
den	1
Feind	1
zu	1
schwächen,	1
so	1
kann	1
man	1
gewiss	1
nicht	1
den	1
Verlust	1
der	1
Privat-Personen	1
in	1
Achtung	1
nehmen."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
the	1
only	1
aim	1
is	1
to	1
weaken	1
the	1
enemy,	1
so	1
of	1
course	1
one	1
cannot	1
take	1
into	1
account	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
private	1
individuals."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,"	1
agreed	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"Extend	1
widely!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
snort,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
ridden	1
past.	1
"In	1
that	1
'extend'	1
were	1
my	1
father,	1
son,	1
and	1
sister,	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
That's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
him!	1
That's	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
you--	1
those	1
German	1
gentlemen	1
won't	1
win	1
the	1
battle	1
tomorrow	1
but	1
will	1
only	1
make	1
all	1
the	1
mess	1
they	1
can,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
nothing	1
in	1
their	1
German	1
heads	1
but	1
theories	1
not	1
worth	1
an	1
empty	1
eggshell	1
and	1
haven't	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
needed	1
tomorrow--that	1
which	1
Timokhin	1
has.	1
They	1
have	1
yielded	1
up	1
all	1
Europe	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
teach	1
us.	1
Fine	1
teachers!"	1
and	1
again	1
his	1
voice	1
grew	1
shrill.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
shall	1
win	1
tomorrow's	1
battle?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
absently.	1
"One	1
thing	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
power,"	1
he	1
began	1
again,	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
prisoners.	1
Why	1
take	1
prisoners?	1
It's	1
chivalry!	1
The	1
French	1
have	1
destroyed	1
my	1
home	1
and	1
are	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
destroy	1
Moscow,	1
they	1
have	1
outraged	1
and	1
are	1
outraging	1
me	1
every	1
moment.	1
They	1
are	1
my	1
enemies.	1
In	1
my	1
opinion	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
criminals.	1
And	1
so	1
thinks	1
Timokhin	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army.	1
They	1
should	1
be	1
executed!	1
Since	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
foes	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
friends,	1
whatever	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
said	1
at	1
Tilsit."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
muttered	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"I	1
quite	1
agree	1
with	1
you!"	1
	1
The	1
question	1
that	1
had	1
perturbed	1
Pierre	1
on	1
the	1
Mozhaysk	1
hill	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
quite	1
clear	1
and	1
completely	1
solved.	1
He	1
now	1
understood	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
and	1
importance	1
of	1
this	1
war	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
battle.	1
All	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
that	1
day,	1
all	1
the	1
significant	1
and	1
stern	1
expressions	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
passing,	1
were	1
lit	1
up	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
light.	1
He	1
understood	1
that	1
latent	1
heat	1
(as	1
they	1
say	1
in	1
physics)	1
of	1
patriotism	1
which	1
was	1
present	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
seen,	1
and	1
this	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
why	1
they	1
all	1
prepared	1
for	1
death	1
calmly,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
lightheartedly.	1
	1
"Not	1
take	1
prisoners,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
continued:	1
"That	1
by	1
itself	1
would	1
quite	1
change	1
the	1
whole	1
war	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
less	1
cruel.	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
have	1
played	1
at	1
war--that's	1
what's	1
vile!	1
We	1
play	1
at	1
magnanimity	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
stuff.	1
Such	1
magnanimity	1
and	1
sensibility	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
magnanimity	1
and	1
sensibility	1
of	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
faints	1
when	1
she	1
sees	1
a	1
calf	1
being	1
killed:	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
kindhearted	1
that	1
she	1
can't	1
look	1
at	1
blood,	1
but	1
enjoys	1
eating	1
the	1
calf	1
served	1
up	1
with	1
sauce.	1
They	1
talk	1
to	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
war,	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
of	1
flags	1
of	1
truce,	1
of	1
mercy	1
to	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
It's	1
all	1
rubbish!	1
I	1
saw	1
chivalry	1
and	1
flags	1
of	1
truce	1
in	1
1805;	1
they	1
humbugged	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
humbugged	1
them.	1
They	1
plunder	1
other	1
people's	1
houses,	1
issue	1
false	1
paper	1
money,	1
and	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
they	1
kill	1
my	1
children	1
and	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
then	1
talk	1
of	1
rules	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
magnanimity	1
to	1
foes!	1
Take	1
no	1
prisoners,	1
but	1
kill	1
and	1
be	1
killed!	1
He	1
who	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
through	1
the	1
same	1
sufferings..."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
him	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
Moscow	1
was	1
taken	1
as	1
Smolensk	1
had	1
been,	1
was	1
suddenly	1
checked	1
in	1
his	1
speech	1
by	1
an	1
unexpected	1
cramp	1
in	1
his	1
throat.	1
He	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
a	1
few	1
times	1
in	1
silence,	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
glittered	1
feverishly	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
as	1
he	1
began	1
speaking.	1
	1
"If	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
this	1
magnanimity	1
in	1
war,	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
war	1
only	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
worth	1
while	1
going	1
to	1
certain	1
death,	1
as	1
now.	1
Then	1
there	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
war	1
because	1
Paul	1
Ivanovich	1
had	1
offended	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich.	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
war,	1
like	1
this	1
one,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
war!	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
different.	1
Then	1
all	1
these	1
Westphalians	1
and	1
Hessians	1
whom	1
Napoleon	1
is	1
leading	1
would	1
not	1
follow	1
him	1
into	1
Russia,	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
Austria	1
and	1
Prussia	1
without	1
knowing	1
why.	1
War	1
is	1
not	1
courtesy	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
thing	1
in	1
life;	1
and	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
and	1
not	1
play	1
at	1
war.	1
We	1
ought	1
to	1
accept	1
this	1
terrible	1
necessity	1
sternly	1
and	1
seriously.	1
It	1
all	1
lies	1
in	1
that:	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
falsehood	1
and	1
let	1
war	1
be	1
war	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
game.	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
now,	1
war	1
is	1
the	1
favorite	1
pastime	1
of	1
the	1
idle	1
and	1
frivolous.	1
The	1
military	1
calling	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
highly	1
honored.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
war?	1
What	1
is	1
needed	1
for	1
success	1
in	1
warfare?	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
habits	1
of	1
the	1
military?	1
The	1
aim	1
of	1
war	1
is	1
murder;	1
the	1
methods	1
of	1
war	1
are	1
spying,	1
treachery,	1
and	1
their	1
encouragement,	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
a	1
country's	1
inhabitants,	1
robbing	1
them	1
or	1
stealing	1
to	1
provision	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
fraud	1
and	1
falsehood	1
termed	1
military	1
craft.	1
The	1
habits	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
class	1
are	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
freedom,	1
that	1
is,	1
discipline,	1
idleness,	1
ignorance,	1
cruelty,	1
debauchery,	1
and	1
drunkenness.	1
And	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
highest	1
class,	1
respected	1
by	1
everyone.	1
All	1
the	1
kings,	1
except	1
the	1
Chinese,	1
wear	1
military	1
uniforms,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
kills	1
most	1
people	1
receives	1
the	1
highest	1
rewards.	1
	1
"They	1
meet,	1
as	1
we	1
shall	1
meet	1
tomorrow,	1
to	1
murder	1
one	1
another;	1
they	1
kill	1
and	1
maim	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
then	1
have	1
thanksgiving	1
services	1
for	1
having	1
killed	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
(they	1
even	1
exaggerate	1
the	1
number),	1
and	1
they	1
announce	1
a	1
victory,	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
people	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
the	1
greater	1
their	1
achievement.	1
How	1
does	1
God	1
above	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
hear	1
them?"	1
exclaimed	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
a	1
shrill,	1
piercing	1
voice.	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
friend,	1
it	1
has	1
of	1
late	1
become	1
hard	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
live.	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
understand	1
too	1
much.	1
And	1
it	1
doesn't	1
do	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil....	1
Ah,	1
well,	1
it's	1
not	1
for	1
long!"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"However,	1
you're	1
sleepy,	1
and	1
it's	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
sleep.	1
Go	1
back	1
to	1
Gorki!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
suddenly.	1
	1
"Oh	1
no!"	1
Pierre	1
replied,	1
looking	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
frightened,	1
compassionate	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Go,	1
go!	1
Before	1
a	1
battle	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
one's	1
sleep	1
out,"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
He	1
came	1
quickly	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
embraced	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
"Good-bye,	1
be	1
off!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
"Whether	1
we	1
meet	1
again	1
or	1
not..."	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
hurriedly	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
shed.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
dark,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
was	1
angry	1
or	1
tender.	1
	1
For	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
silence	1
considering	1
whether	1
he	1
should	1
follow	1
him	1
or	1
go	1
away.	1
"No,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
it!"	1
Pierre	1
concluded.	1
"And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
our	1
last	1
meeting!"	1
He	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
and	1
rode	1
back	1
to	1
Gorki.	1
	1
On	1
re-entering	1
the	1
shed	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
rug,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sleep.	1
	1
He	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
One	1
picture	1
succeeded	1
another	1
in	1
his	1
imagination.	1
On	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
dwelt	1
long	1
and	1
joyfully.	1
He	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
an	1
evening	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
Natasha	1
with	1
animated	1
and	1
excited	1
face	1
was	1
telling	1
him	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
mushrooms	1
the	1
previous	1
summer	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
big	1
forest.	1
She	1
incoherently	1
described	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
her	1
feelings,	1
and	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
a	1
beekeeper	1
she	1
met,	1
and	1
constantly	1
interrupted	1
her	1
story	1
to	1
say:	1
"No,	1
I	1
can't!	1
I'm	1
not	1
telling	1
it	1
right;	1
no,	1
you	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
though	1
he	1
encouraged	1
her	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
understand,	1
and	1
he	1
really	1
had	1
understood	1
all	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
say.	1
But	1
Natasha	1
was	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
words:	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
convey	1
the	1
passionately	1
poetic	1
feeling	1
she	1
had	1
experienced	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
convey.	1
"He	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
delightful	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
dark	1
in	1
the	1
forest...	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
kind...	1
No,	1
I	1
can't	1
describe	1
it,"	1
she	1
had	1
said,	1
flushed	1
and	1
excited.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
now	1
the	1
same	1
happy	1
smile	1
as	1
then	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
understood	1
her,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"I	1
not	1
only	1
understood	1
her,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
that	1
inner,	1
spiritual	1
force,	1
that	1
sincerity,	1
that	1
frankness	1
of	1
soul--	1
that	1
very	1
soul	1
of	1
hers	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
fettered	1
by	1
her	1
body--it	1
was	1
that	1
soul	1
I	1
loved	1
in	1
her...	1
loved	1
so	1
strongly	1
and	1
happily..."	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
his	1
love	1
had	1
ended.	1
"He	1
did	1
not	1
need	1
anything	1
of	1
that	1
kind.	1
He	1
neither	1
saw	1
nor	1
understood	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
He	1
only	1
saw	1
in	1
her	1
a	1
pretty	1
and	1
fresh	1
young	1
girl,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
deign	1
to	1
unite	1
his	1
fate.	1
And	1
I?...	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
still	1
alive	1
and	1
gay!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
jumped	1
up	1
as	1
if	1
someone	1
had	1
burned	1
him,	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
shed.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVI	1
	1
On	1
August	1
25,	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
M.	1
de	1
Beausset,	1
prefect	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Emperor's	1
palace,	1
arrived	1
at	1
Napoleon's	1
quarters	1
at	1
Valuevo	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Fabvier,	1
the	1
former	1
from	1
Paris	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
from	1
Madrid.	1
	1
Donning	1
his	1
court	1
uniform,	1
M.	1
de	1
Beausset	1
ordered	1
a	1
box	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
first	1
compartment	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
tent,	1
where	1
he	1
began	1
opening	1
the	1
box	1
while	1
conversing	1
with	1
Napoleon's	1
aides-de-camp	1
who	1
surrounded	1
him.	1
	1
Fabvier,	1
not	1
entering	1
the	1
tent,	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
talking	1
to	1
some	1
generals	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
left	1
his	1
bedroom	1
and	1
was	1
finishing	1
his	1
toilet.	1
Slightly	1
snorting	1
and	1
grunting,	1
he	1
presented	1
now	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
now	1
his	1
plump	1
hairy	1
chest	1
to	1
the	1
brush	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
valet	1
was	1
rubbing	1
him	1
down.	1
Another	1
valet,	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
over	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
bottle,	1
was	1
sprinkling	1
Eau	1
de	1
Cologne	1
on	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
pampered	1
body	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
knew	1
where	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
Eau	1
de	1
Cologne	1
should	1
be	1
sprinkled.	1
Napoleon's	1
short	1
hair	1
was	1
wet	1
and	1
matted	1
on	1
the	1
forehead,	1
but	1
his	1
face,	1
though	1
puffy	1
and	1
yellow,	1
expressed	1
physical	1
satisfaction.	1
"Go	1
on,	1
harder,	1
go	1
on!"	1
he	1
muttered	1
to	1
the	1
valet	1
who	1
was	1
rubbing	1
him,	1
slightly	1
twitching	1
and	1
grunting.	1
An	1
aide-de-camp,	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
bedroom	1
to	1
report	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
prisoners	1
taken	1
in	1
yesterday's	1
action,	1
was	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
delivering	1
his	1
message,	1
awaiting	1
permission	1
to	1
withdraw.	1
Napoleon,	1
frowning,	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows.	1
	1
"No	1
prisoners!"	1
said	1
he,	1
repeating	1
the	1
aide-de-camp's	1
words.	1
"They	1
are	1
forcing	1
us	1
to	1
exterminate	1
them.	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
the	1
Russian	1
army....	1
Go	1
on...	1
harder,	1
harder!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
hunching	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
presenting	1
his	1
fat	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"All	1
right.	1
Let	1
Monsieur	1
de	1
Beausset	1
enter,	1
and	1
Fabvier	1
too,"	1
he	1
said,	1
nodding	1
to	1
the	1
aide-de-camp.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sire,"	1
and	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
disappeared	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
Two	1
valets	1
rapidly	1
dressed	1
His	1
Majesty,	1
and	1
wearing	1
the	1
blue	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
Guards	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
firm	1
quick	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
reception	1
room.	1
	1
De	1
Beausset's	1
hands	1
meanwhile	1
were	1
busily	1
engaged	1
arranging	1
the	1
present	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
Empress,	1
on	1
two	1
chairs	1
directly	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
entrance.	1
But	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
dressed	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
such	1
unexpected	1
rapidity	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
arranging	1
the	1
surprise.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
noticed	1
at	1
once	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
and	1
guessed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
ready.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
deprive	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
surprise,	1
so	1
he	1
pretended	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
de	1
Beausset	1
and	1
called	1
Fabvier	1
to	1
him,	1
listening	1
silently	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
frown	1
to	1
what	1
Fabvier	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
heroism	1
and	1
devotion	1
of	1
his	1
troops	1
fighting	1
at	1
Salamanca,	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
Europe,	1
with	1
but	1
one	1
thought--to	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
their	1
Emperor--and	1
but	1
one	1
fear--to	1
fail	1
to	1
please	1
him.	1
The	1
result	1
of	1
that	1
battle	1
had	1
been	1
deplorable.	1
Napoleon	1
made	1
ironic	1
remarks	1
during	1
Fabvier's	1
account,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
that	1
matters	1
could	1
go	1
otherwise	1
in	1
his	1
absence.	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
that	1
in	1
Moscow,"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
"I'll	1
see	1
you	1
later,"	1
he	1
added,	1
and	1
summoned	1
de	1
Beausset,	1
who	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
had	1
prepared	1
the	1
surprise,	1
having	1
placed	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
chairs	1
and	1
covered	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
cloth.	1
	1
De	1
Beausset	1
bowed	1
low,	1
with	1
that	1
courtly	1
French	1
bow	1
which	1
only	1
the	1
old	1
retainers	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
make,	1
and	1
approached	1
him,	1
presenting	1
an	1
envelope.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
gaily	1
and	1
pulled	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
hurried	1
here.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad.	1
Well,	1
what	1
is	1
Paris	1
saying?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
suddenly	1
changing	1
his	1
former	1
stern	1
expression	1
for	1
a	1
most	1
cordial	1
tone.	1
	1
"Sire,	1
all	1
Paris	1
regrets	1
your	1
absence,"	1
replied	1
de	1
Beausset	1
as	1
was	1
proper.	1
	1
But	1
though	1
Napoleon	1
knew	1
that	1
de	1
Beausset	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
and	1
though	1
in	1
his	1
lucid	1
moments	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
untrue,	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
from	1
him.	1
Again	1
he	1
honored	1
him	1
by	1
touching	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
you	1
travel	1
so	1
far,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Sire,	1
I	1
expected	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Moscow,"	1
replied	1
de	1
Beausset.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
smiled	1
and,	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
absent-mindedly,	1
glanced	1
to	1
the	1
right.	1
An	1
aide-de-camp	1
approached	1
with	1
gliding	1
steps	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox,	1
which	1
he	1
took.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
has	1
happened	1
luckily	1
for	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
raising	1
the	1
open	1
snuffbox	1
to	1
his	1
nose.	1
"You	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
travel,	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
Moscow.	1
You	1
surely	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
Asiatic	1
capital.	1
You	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
pleasant	1
journey."	1
	1
De	1
Beausset	1
bowed	1
gratefully	1
at	1
this	1
regard	1
for	1
his	1
taste	1
for	1
travel	1
(of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
till	1
then	1
been	1
aware).	1
	1
"Ha,	1
what's	1
this?"	1
asked	1
Napoleon,	1
noticing	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
courtiers	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
something	1
concealed	1
under	1
a	1
cloth.	1
	1
With	1
courtly	1
adroitness	1
de	1
Beausset	1
half	1
turned	1
and	1
without	1
turning	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
retired	1
two	1
steps,	1
twitching	1
off	1
the	1
cloth	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"A	1
present	1
to	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
from	1
the	1
Empress."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
portrait,	1
painted	1
in	1
bright	1
colors	1
by	1
Gerard,	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
borne	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
by	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Austria,	1
the	1
boy	1
whom	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
everyone	1
called	1
"The	1
King	1
of	1
Rome."	1
	1
A	1
very	1
pretty	1
curly-headed	1
boy	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
Christ	1
in	1
the	1
Sistine	1
Madonna	1
was	1
depicted	1
playing	1
at	1
stick	1
and	1
ball.	1
The	1
ball	1
represented	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
globe	1
and	1
the	1
stick	1
in	1
his	1
other	1
hand	1
a	1
scepter.	1
	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
clear	1
what	1
the	1
artist	1
meant	1
to	1
express	1
by	1
depicting	1
the	1
so-called	1
King	1
of	1
Rome	1
spiking	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
a	1
stick,	1
the	1
allegory	1
apparently	1
seemed	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
Paris,	1
quite	1
clear	1
and	1
very	1
pleasing.	1
	1
"The	1
King	1
of	1
Rome!"	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
portrait	1
with	1
a	1
graceful	1
gesture.	1
"Admirable!"	1
	1
With	1
the	1
natural	1
capacity	1
of	1
an	1
Italian	1
for	1
changing	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
at	1
will,	1
he	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
portrait	1
and	1
assumed	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
pensive	1
tenderness.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
now	1
said	1
and	1
did	1
would	1
be	1
historical,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
best	1
for	1
him--	1
whose	1
grandeur	1
enabled	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
play	1
stick	1
and	1
ball	1
with	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
globe--to	1
show,	1
in	1
contrast	1
to	1
that	1
grandeur,	1
the	1
simplest	1
paternal	1
tenderness.	1
His	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim,	1
he	1
moved	1
forward,	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
a	1
chair	1
(which	1
seemed	1
to	1
place	1
itself	1
under	1
him),	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
portrait.	1
At	1
a	1
single	1
gesture	1
from	1
him	1
everyone	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
tiptoe,	1
leaving	1
the	1
great	1
man	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
emotion.	1
	1
Having	1
sat	1
still	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
touched--himself	1
not	1
knowing	1
why--the	1
thick	1
spot	1
of	1
paint	1
representing	1
the	1
highest	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
portrait,	1
rose,	1
and	1
recalled	1
de	1
Beausset	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
on	1
duty.	1
He	1
ordered	1
the	1
portrait	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
outside	1
his	1
tent,	1
that	1
the	1
Old	1
Guard,	1
stationed	1
round	1
it,	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Rome,	1
the	1
son	1
and	1
heir	1
of	1
their	1
adored	1
monarch.	1
	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
M.	1
de	1
Beausset	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
breakfasting	1
with	1
him,	1
they	1
heard,	1
as	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
anticipated,	1
the	1
rapturous	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
Old	1
Guard	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
portrait.	1
	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!	1
Vive	1
le	1
roi	1
de	1
Rome!	1
Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
came	1
those	1
ecstatic	1
cries.	1
	1
After	1
breakfast	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
de	1
Beausset's	1
presence	1
dictated	1
his	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
army.	1
	1
"Short	1
and	1
energetic!"	1
he	1
remarked	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
over	1
the	1
proclamation	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
dictated	1
straight	1
off	1
without	1
corrections.	1
It	1
ran:	1
	1
Soldiers!	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
battle	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
longed	1
for.	1
Victory	1
depends	1
on	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
essential	1
for	1
us;	1
it	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
all	1
we	1
need:	1
comfortable	1
quarters	1
and	1
a	1
speedy	1
return	1
to	1
our	1
country.	1
Behave	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
at	1
Austerlitz,	1
Friedland,	1
Vitebsk,	1
and	1
Smolensk.	1
Let	1
our	1
remotest	1
posterity	1
recall	1
your	1
achievements	1
this	1
day	1
with	1
pride.	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
each	1
of	1
you:	1
"He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
battle	1
before	1
Moscow!"	1
	1
"Before	1
Moscow!"	1
repeated	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
inviting	1
M.	1
de	1
Beausset,	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
travel,	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
ride,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
horses	1
stood	1
saddled.	1
	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
is	1
too	1
kind!"	1
replied	1
de	1
Beausset	1
to	1
the	1
invitation	1
to	1
accompany	1
the	1
Emperor;	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
sleep,	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
ride	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
doing	1
so.	1
	1
But	1
Napoleon	1
nodded	1
to	1
the	1
traveler,	1
and	1
de	1
Beausset	1
had	1
to	1
mount.	1
When	1
Napoleon	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
the	1
shouting	1
of	1
the	1
Guards	1
before	1
his	1
son's	1
portrait	1
grew	1
still	1
louder.	1
Napoleon	1
frowned.	1
	1
"Take	1
him	1
away!"	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
with	1
a	1
gracefully	1
majestic	1
gesture	1
to	1
the	1
portrait.	1
"It	1
is	1
too	1
soon	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
battle."	1
	1
De	1
Beausset	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
bowed	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
sighed	1
deeply,	1
to	1
indicate	1
how	1
profoundly	1
he	1
valued	1
and	1
comprehended	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
words.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVII	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-fifth	1
of	1
August,	1
so	1
his	1
historians	1
tell	1
us,	1
Napoleon	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
on	1
horseback	1
inspecting	1
the	1
locality,	1
considering	1
plans	1
submitted	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
marshals,	1
and	1
personally	1
giving	1
commands	1
to	1
his	1
generals.	1
	1
The	1
original	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
forces	1
along	1
the	1
river	1
Kolocha	1
had	1
been	1
dislocated	1
by	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-	1
fourth,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
line--the	1
left	1
flank--had	1
been	1
drawn	1
back.	1
That	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
was	1
not	1
entrenched	1
and	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
more	1
open	1
and	1
level	1
than	1
elsewhere.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
to	1
anyone,	1
military	1
or	1
not,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
here	1
the	1
French	1
should	1
attack.	1
It	1
would	1
seem	1
that	1
not	1
much	1
consideration	1
was	1
needed	1
to	1
reach	1
this	1
conclusion,	1
nor	1
any	1
particular	1
care	1
or	1
trouble	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
his	1
marshals,	1
nor	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
need	1
of	1
that	1
special	1
and	1
supreme	1
quality	1
called	1
genius	1
that	1
people	1
are	1
so	1
apt	1
to	1
ascribe	1
to	1
Napoleon;	1
yet	1
the	1
historians	1
who	1
described	1
the	1
event	1
later	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
then	1
surrounded	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
he	1
himself,	1
thought	1
otherwise.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
over	1
the	1
plain	1
and	1
surveyed	1
the	1
locality	1
with	1
a	1
profound	1
air	1
and	1
in	1
silence,	1
nodded	1
with	1
approval	1
or	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
dubiously,	1
and	1
without	1
communicating	1
to	1
the	1
generals	1
around	1
him	1
the	1
profound	1
course	1
of	1
ideas	1
which	1
guided	1
his	1
decisions	1
merely	1
gave	1
them	1
his	1
final	1
conclusions	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
commands.	1
Having	1
listened	1
to	1
a	1
suggestion	1
from	1
Davout,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
called	1
Prince	1
d'Eckmuhl,	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
Russian	1
left	1
wing,	1
Napoleon	1
said	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
done,	1
without	1
explaining	1
why	1
not.	1
To	1
a	1
proposal	1
made	1
by	1
General	1
Campan	1
(who	1
was	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
fleches)	1
to	1
lead	1
his	1
division	1
through	1
the	1
woods,	1
Napoleon	1
agreed,	1
though	1
the	1
so-called	1
Duke	1
of	1
Elchingen	1
(Ney)	1
ventured	1
to	1
remark	1
that	1
a	1
movement	1
through	1
the	1
woods	1
was	1
dangerous	1
and	1
might	1
disorder	1
the	1
division.	1
	1
Having	1
inspected	1
the	1
country	1
opposite	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt,	1
Napoleon	1
pondered	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
then	1
indicated	1
the	1
spots	1
where	1
two	1
batteries	1
should	1
be	1
set	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
morrow	1
to	1
act	1
against	1
the	1
Russian	1
entrenchments,	1
and	1
the	1
places	1
where,	1
in	1
line	1
with	1
them,	1
the	1
field	1
artillery	1
should	1
be	1
placed.	1
	1
After	1
giving	1
these	1
and	1
other	1
commands	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
tent,	1
and	1
the	1
dispositions	1
for	1
the	1
battle	1
were	1
written	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
dictation.	1
	1
These	1
dispositions,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
historians	1
write	1
with	1
enthusiasm	1
and	1
other	1
historians	1
with	1
profound	1
respect,	1
were	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
At	1
dawn	1
the	1
two	1
new	1
batteries	1
established	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
the	1
plain	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
Prince	1
d'Eckmuhl	1
will	1
open	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
opposing	1
batteries	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
artillery	1
of	1
the	1
1st	1
Corps,	1
General	1
Pernetti,	1
with	1
thirty	1
cannon	1
of	1
Campan's	1
division	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
howitzers	1
of	1
Dessaix's	1
and	1
Friant's	1
divisions,	1
will	1
move	1
forward,	1
open	1
fire,	1
and	1
overwhelm	1
with	1
shellfire	1
the	1
enemy's	1
battery,	1
against	1
which	1
will	1
operate:	1
	1
	1
24	1
guns	1
of	1
the	1
artillery	1
of	1
the	1
Guards	1
30	1
guns	1
of	1
Campan's	1
division	1
	1
and	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
8	1
guns	1
of	1
Friant's	1
and	1
Dessaix's	1
divisions	1
--	1
	1
in	1
all	1
62	1
guns.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
artillery	1
of	1
the	1
3rd	1
Corps,	1
General	1
Fouche,	1
will	1
place	1
the	1
howitzers	1
of	1
the	1
3rd	1
and	1
8th	1
Corps,	1
sixteen	1
in	1
all,	1
on	1
the	1
flanks	1
of	1
the	1
battery	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
bombard	1
the	1
entrenchment	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
which	1
will	1
have	1
forty	1
guns	1
in	1
all	1
directed	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
General	1
Sorbier	1
must	1
be	1
ready	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
order	1
to	1
advance	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
howitzers	1
of	1
the	1
Guard's	1
artillery	1
against	1
either	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
entrenchments.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
cannonade	1
Prince	1
Poniatowski	1
is	1
to	1
advance	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
on	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
turn	1
the	1
enemy's	1
position.	1
	1
General	1
Campan	1
will	1
move	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
first	1
fortification.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
advance	1
has	1
begun	1
in	1
this	1
manner,	1
orders	1
will	1
be	1
given	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
enemy's	1
movements.	1
	1
The	1
cannonade	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
will	1
begin	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
guns	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
wing	1
are	1
heard.	1
The	1
sharpshooters	1
of	1
Morand's	1
division	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
vice-King's	1
division	1
will	1
open	1
a	1
heavy	1
fire	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
attack	1
commence	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
wing.	1
	1
The	1
vice-King	1
will	1
occupy	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
cross	1
by	1
its	1
three	1
bridges,	1
advancing	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
heights	1
as	1
Morand's	1
and	1
Gibrard's	1
divisions,	1
which	1
under	1
his	1
leadership	1
will	1
be	1
directed	1
against	1
the	1
redoubt	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
line	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
forces.	1
	1
All	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
good	1
order	1
(le	1
tout	1
se	1
fera	1
avec	1
ordre	1
et	1
methode)	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
retaining	1
troops	1
in	1
reserve.	1
	1
The	1
Imperial	1
Camp	1
near	1
Mozhaysk,	1
	1
September,	1
6,	1
1812.	1
	1
These	1
dispositions,	1
which	1
are	1
very	1
obscure	1
and	1
confused	1
if	1
one	1
allows	1
oneself	1
to	1
regard	1
the	1
arrangements	1
without	1
religious	1
awe	1
of	1
his	1
genius,	1
related	1
to	1
Napoleon's	1
orders	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
four	1
points--four	1
different	1
orders.	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was,	1
or	1
could	1
be,	1
carried	1
out.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
disposition	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
first	1
that	1
the	1
batteries	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
chosen	1
by	1
Napoleon,	1
with	1
the	1
guns	1
of	1
Pernetti	1
and	1
Fouche;	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
line	1
with	1
them,	1
102	1
guns	1
in	1
all,	1
were	1
to	1
open	1
fire	1
and	1
shower	1
shells	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
fleches	1
and	1
redoubts.	1
This	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done,	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
spots	1
selected	1
by	1
Napoleon	1
the	1
projectiles	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
works,	1
and	1
those	1
102	1
guns	1
shot	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
until	1
the	1
nearest	1
commander,	1
contrary	1
to	1
Napoleon's	1
instructions,	1
moved	1
them	1
forward.	1
	1
The	1
second	1
order	1
was	1
that	1
Poniatowski,	1
moving	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
through	1
the	1
wood,	1
should	1
turn	1
the	1
Russian	1
left	1
flank.	1
This	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
done,	1
because	1
Poniatowski,	1
advancing	1
on	1
the	1
village	1
through	1
the	1
wood,	1
met	1
Tuchkov	1
there	1
barring	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
the	1
Russian	1
position.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
order	1
was:	1
General	1
Campan	1
will	1
move	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
first	1
fortification.	1
General	1
Campan's	1
division	1
did	1
not	1
seize	1
the	1
first	1
fortification	1
but	1
was	1
driven	1
back,	1
for	1
on	1
emerging	1
from	1
the	1
wood	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
reform	1
under	1
grapeshot,	1
of	1
which	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
unaware.	1
	1
The	1
fourth	1
order	1
was:	1
The	1
vice-King	1
will	1
occupy	1
the	1
village	1
(Borodino)	1
and	1
cross	1
by	1
its	1
three	1
bridges,	1
advancing	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
heights	1
as	1
Morand's	1
and	1
Gibrard's	1
divisions	1
(for	1
whose	1
movements	1
no	1
directions	1
are	1
given),	1
which	1
under	1
his	1
leadership	1
will	1
be	1
directed	1
against	1
the	1
redoubt	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
line	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
forces.	1
	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
one	1
can	1
make	1
out,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
this	1
unintelligible	1
sentence	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
attempts	1
the	1
vice-King	1
made	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
orders	1
given	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
advance	1
from	1
the	1
left	1
through	1
Borodino	1
to	1
the	1
redoubt	1
while	1
the	1
divisions	1
of	1
Morand	1
and	1
Gerard	1
were	1
to	1
advance	1
simultaneously	1
from	1
the	1
front.	1
	1
All	1
this,	1
like	1
the	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
disposition,	1
was	1
not	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
executed.	1
After	1
passing	1
through	1
Borodino	1
the	1
vice-King	1
was	1
driven	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Kolocha	1
and	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
farther;	1
while	1
the	1
divisions	1
of	1
Morand	1
and	1
Gerard	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
redoubt	1
but	1
were	1
driven	1
back,	1
and	1
the	1
redoubt	1
was	1
only	1
taken	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
by	1
the	1
cavalry	1
(a	1
thing	1
probably	1
unforeseen	1
and	1
not	1
heard	1
of	1
by	1
Napoleon).	1
So	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
orders	1
in	1
the	1
disposition	1
was,	1
or	1
could	1
be,	1
executed.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
disposition	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that,	1
after	1
the	1
fight	1
has	1
commenced	1
in	1
this	1
manner,	1
orders	1
will	1
be	1
given	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
enemy's	1
movements,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
all	1
necessary	1
arrangements	1
would	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
Napoleon	1
during	1
the	1
battle.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done,	1
for	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
battle	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
away	1
that,	1
as	1
appeared	1
later,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
orders	1
during	1
the	1
fight	1
could	1
be	1
executed.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVIII	1
	1
Many	1
historians	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
did	1
not	1
win	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
because	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
a	1
cold,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
a	1
cold	1
the	1
orders	1
he	1
gave	1
before	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
battle	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
still	1
more	1
full	1
of	1
genius	1
and	1
Russia	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
lost	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
have	1
been	1
changed.	1
To	1
historians	1
who	1
believe	1
that	1
Russia	1
was	1
shaped	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
man--Peter	1
the	1
Great--and	1
that	1
France	1
from	1
a	1
republic	1
became	1
an	1
empire	1
and	1
French	1
armies	1
went	1
to	1
Russia	1
at	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
man--Napoleon--to	1
say	1
that	1
Russia	1
remained	1
a	1
power	1
because	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
a	1
bad	1
cold	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fourth	1
of	1
August	1
may	1
seem	1
logical	1
and	1
convincing.	1
	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
depended	1
on	1
Napoleon's	1
will	1
to	1
fight	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
and	1
if	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
other	1
arrangement	1
depended	1
on	1
his	1
will,	1
then	1
evidently	1
a	1
cold	1
affecting	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
his	1
will	1
might	1
have	1
saved	1
Russia,	1
and	1
consequently	1
the	1
valet	1
who	1
omitted	1
to	1
bring	1
Napoleon	1
his	1
waterproof	1
boots	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fourth	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
savior	1
of	1
Russia.	1
Along	1
that	1
line	1
of	1
thought	1
such	1
a	1
deduction	1
is	1
indubitable,	1
as	1
indubitable	1
as	1
the	1
deduction	1
Voltaire	1
made	1
in	1
jest	1
(without	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
jesting	1
at)	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Massacre	1
of	1
St.	1
Bartholomew	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
Charles	1
IX's	1
stomach	1
being	1
deranged.	1
But	1
to	1
men	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
admit	1
that	1
Russia	1
was	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
Peter	1
I,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
Empire	1
was	1
formed	1
and	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Russia	1
begun	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
Napoleon,	1
that	1
argument	1
seems	1
not	1
merely	1
untrue	1
and	1
irrational,	1
but	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
human	1
reality.	1
To	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
what	1
causes	1
historic	1
events	1
another	1
answer	1
presents	1
itself,	1
namely,	1
that	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
human	1
events	1
is	1
predetermined	1
from	1
on	1
high--	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
coincidence	1
of	1
the	1
wills	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
events,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
Napoleon's	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
events	1
is	1
purely	1
external	1
and	1
fictitious.	1
	1
Strange	1
as	1
at	1
first	1
glance	1
it	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
Massacre	1
of	1
St.	1
Bartholomew	1
was	1
not	1
due	1
to	1
Charles	1
IX's	1
will,	1
though	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
order	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
that	1
order;	1
and	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
men	1
at	1
Borodino	1
was	1
not	1
due	1
to	1
Napoleon's	1
will,	1
though	1
he	1
ordered	1
the	1
commencement	1
and	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
because	1
he	1
ordered	1
it;	1
strange	1
as	1
these	1
suppositions	1
appear,	1
yet	1
human	1
dignity--	1
which	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
is,	1
if	1
not	1
more	1
at	1
least	1
not	1
less	1
a	1
man	1
than	1
the	1
great	1
Napoleon--demands	1
the	1
acceptance	1
of	1
that	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
and	1
historic	1
investigation	1
abundantly	1
confirms	1
it.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
Napoleon	1
shot	1
at	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
killed	1
no	1
one.	1
That	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
Therefore	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
he	1
who	1
killed	1
people.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
soldiers	1
went	1
to	1
kill	1
and	1
be	1
killed	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
orders	1
but	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
volition.	1
The	1
whole	1
army--French,	1
Italian,	1
German,	1
Polish,	1
and	1
Dutch--hungry,	1
ragged,	1
and	1
weary	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
blocking	1
their	1
road	1
to	1
Moscow	1
that	1
the	1
wine	1
was	1
drawn	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
drunk.	1
Had	1
Napoleon	1
then	1
forbidden	1
them	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
Russians,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
him	1
and	1
have	1
proceeded	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
Russians	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
inevitable.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
Napoleon's	1
proclamation	1
offering	1
them,	1
as	1
compensation	1
for	1
mutilation	1
and	1
death,	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
posterity	1
about	1
their	1
having	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
before	1
Moscow,	1
they	1
cried	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
cried	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
boy	1
piercing	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
globe	1
with	1
a	1
toy	1
stick,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
cried	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
at	1
any	1
nonsense	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
told	1
them.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
left	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
cry	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
fight,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
get	1
food	1
and	1
rest	1
as	1
conquerors	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
commands	1
that	1
they	1
killed	1
their	1
fellow	1
men.	1
	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Napoleon	1
who	1
directed	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
battle,	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
orders	1
were	1
executed	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
battle	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
before	1
him.	1
So	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
these	1
people	1
killed	1
one	1
another	1
was	1
not	1
decided	1
by	1
Napoleon's	1
will	1
but	1
occurred	1
independently	1
of	1
him,	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
action.	1
It	1
only	1
seemed	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
that	1
it	1
all	1
took	1
place	1
by	1
his	1
will.	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
or	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
cold	1
has	1
no	1
more	1
historic	1
interest	1
than	1
the	1
cold	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
transport	1
soldiers.	1
	1
Moreover,	1
the	1
assertion	1
made	1
by	1
various	1
writers	1
that	1
his	1
cold	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
dispositions	1
not	1
being	1
as	1
well-planned	1
as	1
on	1
former	1
occasions,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
orders	1
during	1
the	1
battle	1
not	1
being	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
previously,	1
is	1
quite	1
baseless,	1
which	1
again	1
shows	1
that	1
Napoleon's	1
cold	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
of	1
August	1
was	1
unimportant.	1
	1
The	1
dispositions	1
cited	1
above	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
worse,	1
but	1
are	1
even	1
better,	1
than	1
previous	1
dispositions	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
won	1
victories.	1
His	1
pseudo-	1
orders	1
during	1
the	1
battle	1
were	1
also	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
formerly,	1
but	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
usual.	1
These	1
dispositions	1
and	1
orders	1
only	1
seem	1
worse	1
than	1
previous	1
ones	1
because	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
win.	1
The	1
profoundest	1
and	1
most	1
excellent	1
dispositions	1
and	1
orders	1
seem	1
very	1
bad,	1
and	1
every	1
learned	1
militarist	1
criticizes	1
them	1
with	1
looks	1
of	1
importance,	1
when	1
they	1
relate	1
to	1
a	1
battle	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
lost,	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
worst	1
dispositions	1
and	1
orders	1
seem	1
very	1
good,	1
and	1
serious	1
people	1
fill	1
whole	1
volumes	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
their	1
merits,	1
when	1
they	1
relate	1
to	1
a	1
battle	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
won.	1
	1
The	1
dispositions	1
drawn	1
up	1
by	1
Weyrother	1
for	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
were	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
perfection	1
for	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
composition,	1
but	1
still	1
they	1
were	1
criticized--criticized	1
for	1
their	1
very	1
perfection,	1
for	1
their	1
excessive	1
minuteness.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
office	1
as	1
representative	1
of	1
authority	1
as	1
well	1
as,	1
and	1
even	1
better	1
than,	1
at	1
other	1
battles.	1
He	1
did	1
nothing	1
harmful	1
to	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
battle;	1
he	1
inclined	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
reasonable	1
opinions,	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
confusion,	1
did	1
not	1
contradict	1
himself,	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
frightened	1
or	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
but	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
tact	1
and	1
military	1
experience	1
carried	1
out	1
his	1
role	1
of	1
appearing	1
to	1
command,	1
calmly	1
and	1
with	1
dignity.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIX	1
	1
On	1
returning	1
from	1
a	1
second	1
inspection	1
of	1
the	1
lines,	1
Napoleon	1
remarked:	1
	1
"The	1
chessmen	1
are	1
set	1
up,	1
the	1
game	1
will	1
begin	1
tomorrow!"	1
	1
Having	1
ordered	1
punch	1
and	1
summoned	1
de	1
Beausset,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
Paris	1
and	1
about	1
some	1
changes	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
Empress'	1
household,	1
surprising	1
the	1
prefect	1
by	1
his	1
memory	1
of	1
minute	1
details	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
court.	1
	1
He	1
showed	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
trifles,	1
joked	1
about	1
de	1
Beausset's	1
love	1
of	1
travel,	1
and	1
chatted	1
carelessly,	1
as	1
a	1
famous,	1
self-confident	1
surgeon	1
who	1
knows	1
his	1
job	1
does	1
when	1
turning	1
up	1
his	1
sleeves	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
apron	1
while	1
a	1
patient	1
is	1
being	1
strapped	1
to	1
the	1
operating	1
table.	1
"The	1
matter	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
is	1
clear	1
and	1
definite	1
in	1
my	1
head.	1
When	1
the	1
time	1
comes	1
to	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
it	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
could,	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
can	1
jest,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
I	1
jest	1
and	1
the	1
calmer	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
more	1
tranquil	1
and	1
confident	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
amazed	1
at	1
my	1
genius."	1
	1
Having	1
finished	1
his	1
second	1
glass	1
of	1
punch,	1
Napoleon	1
went	1
to	1
rest	1
before	1
the	1
serious	1
business	1
which,	1
he	1
considered,	1
awaited	1
him	1
next	1
day.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
that	1
task	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
cold	1
which	1
had	1
grown	1
worse	1
from	1
the	1
dampness	1
of	1
the	1
evening,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
large	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
at	1
three	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
loudly	1
blowing	1
his	1
nose.	1
He	1
asked	1
whether	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
not	1
withdrawn,	1
and	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fires	1
were	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
places.	1
He	1
nodded	1
approval.	1
	1
The	1
adjutant	1
in	1
attendance	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Rapp,	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
shall	1
do	1
good	1
business	1
today?"	1
Napoleon	1
asked	1
him.	1
	1
"Without	1
doubt,	1
sire,"	1
replied	1
Rapp.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember,	1
sire,	1
what	1
you	1
did	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
say	1
at	1
Smolensk?"	1
continued	1
Rapp.	1
"The	1
wine	1
is	1
drawn	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
drunk."	1
	1
Napoleon	1
frowned	1
and	1
sat	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"This	1
poor	1
army!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
remarked.	1
"It	1
has	1
diminished	1
greatly	1
since	1
Smolensk.	1
Fortune	1
is	1
frankly	1
a	1
courtesan,	1
Rapp.	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
said	1
so	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
beginning	1
to	1
experience	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
Guards,	1
Rapp,	1
the	1
Guards	1
are	1
intact?"	1
he	1
remarked	1
interrogatively.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sire,"	1
replied	1
Rapp.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
took	1
a	1
lozenge,	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
sleepy	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
not	1
nearly	1
morning.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
give	1
further	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
killing	1
time,	1
for	1
the	1
orders	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
given	1
and	1
were	1
now	1
being	1
executed.	1
	1
"Have	1
the	1
biscuits	1
and	1
rice	1
been	1
served	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
regiments	1
of	1
the	1
Guards?"	1
asked	1
Napoleon	1
sternly.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sire."	1
	1
"The	1
rice	1
too?"	1
	1
Rapp	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
order	1
about	1
the	1
rice,	1
but	1
Napoleon	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
dissatisfaction	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
believing	1
that	1
his	1
order	1
had	1
been	1
executed.	1
An	1
attendant	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
punch.	1
Napoleon	1
ordered	1
another	1
glass	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
for	1
Rapp,	1
and	1
silently	1
sipped	1
his	1
own.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
neither	1
taste	1
nor	1
smell,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
sniffing	1
at	1
his	1
glass.	1
"This	1
cold	1
is	1
tiresome.	1
They	1
talk	1
about	1
medicine--what	1
is	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
medicine	1
when	1
it	1
can't	1
cure	1
a	1
cold!	1
Corvisart	1
gave	1
me	1
these	1
lozenges	1
but	1
they	1
don't	1
help	1
at	1
all.	1
What	1
can	1
doctors	1
cure?	1
One	1
can't	1
cure	1
anything.	1
Our	1
body	1
is	1
a	1
machine	1
for	1
living.	1
It	1
is	1
organized	1
for	1
that,	1
it	1
is	1
its	1
nature.	1
Let	1
life	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
it	1
unhindered	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
defend	1
itself,	1
it	1
will	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
if	1
you	1
paralyze	1
it	1
by	1
encumbering	1
it	1
with	1
remedies.	1
Our	1
body	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
perfect	1
watch	1
that	1
should	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
time;	1
the	1
watchmaker	1
cannot	1
open	1
it,	1
he	1
can	1
only	1
adjust	1
it	1
by	1
fumbling,	1
and	1
that	1
blindfold....	1
Yes,	1
our	1
body	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
machine	1
for	1
living,	1
that	1
is	1
all."	1
	1
And	1
having	1
entered	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
definition,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
fond,	1
Napoleon	1
suddenly	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
gave	1
a	1
new	1
one.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Rapp,	1
what	1
military	1
art	1
is?"	1
asked	1
he.	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
being	1
stronger	1
than	1
the	1
enemy	1
at	1
a	1
given	1
moment.	1
That's	1
all."	1
	1
Rapp	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"Tomorrow	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
Kutuzov!"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
"We	1
shall	1
see!	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
at	1
Braunau	1
he	1
commanded	1
an	1
army	1
for	1
three	1
weeks	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
mount	1
a	1
horse	1
to	1
inspect	1
his	1
entrenchments....	1
We	1
shall	1
see!"	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
It	1
was	1
still	1
only	1
four	1
o'clock.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
sleepy.	1
The	1
punch	1
was	1
finished	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
nothing	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
rose,	1
walked	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
warm	1
overcoat	1
and	1
a	1
hat,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tent.	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
damp,	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
moisture	1
was	1
descending	1
from	1
above.	1
Near	1
by,	1
the	1
campfires	1
were	1
dimly	1
burning	1
among	1
the	1
French	1
Guards,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
line	1
shone	1
through	1
the	1
smoke.	1
The	1
weather	1
was	1
calm,	1
and	1
the	1
rustle	1
and	1
tramp	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
troops	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
move	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
their	1
positions	1
were	1
clearly	1
audible.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
walked	1
about	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
tent,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fires	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
these	1
sounds,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
passing	1
a	1
tall	1
guardsman	1
in	1
a	1
shaggy	1
cap,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
sentinel	1
before	1
his	1
tent	1
and	1
had	1
drawn	1
himself	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
black	1
pillar	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
Napoleon	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
year	1
did	1
you	1
enter	1
the	1
service?"	1
he	1
asked	1
with	1
that	1
affectation	1
of	1
military	1
bluntness	1
and	1
geniality	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
always	1
addressed	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
answered	1
the	1
question.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
ones!	1
Has	1
your	1
regiment	1
had	1
its	1
rice?"	1
	1
"It	1
has,	1
Your	1
Majesty."	1
	1
Napoleon	1
nodded	1
and	1
walked	1
away.	1
	1
At	1
half-past	1
five	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Shevardino.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
growing	1
light,	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
clearing,	1
only	1
a	1
single	1
cloud	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
east.	1
The	1
abandoned	1
campfires	1
were	1
burning	1
themselves	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
faint	1
morning	1
light.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
right	1
a	1
single	1
deep	1
report	1
of	1
a	1
cannon	1
resounded	1
and	1
died	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
prevailing	1
silence.	1
Some	1
minutes	1
passed.	1
A	1
second	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
report	1
shook	1
the	1
air,	1
then	1
a	1
fourth	1
and	1
a	1
fifth	1
boomed	1
solemnly	1
near	1
by	1
on	1
the	1
right.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
shots	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
ceased	1
to	1
reverberate	1
before	1
others	1
rang	1
out	1
and	1
yet	1
more	1
were	1
heard	1
mingling	1
with	1
and	1
overtaking	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
his	1
suite	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
where	1
he	1
dismounted.	1
The	1
game	1
had	1
begun.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXX	1
	1
On	1
returning	1
to	1
Gorki	1
after	1
having	1
seen	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
Pierre	1
ordered	1
his	1
groom	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
horses	1
ready	1
and	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
then	1
immediately	1
fell	1
asleep	1
behind	1
a	1
partition	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
Boris	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Before	1
he	1
was	1
thoroughly	1
awake	1
next	1
morning	1
everybody	1
had	1
already	1
left	1
the	1
hut.	1
The	1
panes	1
were	1
rattling	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
windows	1
and	1
his	1
groom	1
was	1
shaking	1
him.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency!	1
Your	1
excellency!	1
Your	1
excellency!"	1
he	1
kept	1
repeating	1
pertinaciously	1
while	1
he	1
shook	1
Pierre	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
having	1
apparently	1
lost	1
hope	1
of	1
getting	1
him	1
to	1
wake	1
up.	1
	1
"What?	1
Has	1
it	1
begun?	1
Is	1
it	1
time?"	1
Pierre	1
asked,	1
waking	1
up.	1
	1
"Hear	1
the	1
firing,"	1
said	1
the	1
groom,	1
a	1
discharged	1
soldier.	1
"All	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
have	1
gone	1
out,	1
and	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
himself	1
rode	1
past	1
long	1
ago."	1
	1
Pierre	1
dressed	1
hastily	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
Outside	1
all	1
was	1
bright,	1
fresh,	1
dewy,	1
and	1
cheerful.	1
The	1
sun,	1
just	1
bursting	1
forth	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
cloud	1
that	1
had	1
concealed	1
it,	1
was	1
shining,	1
with	1
rays	1
still	1
half	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
clouds,	1
over	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
opposite,	1
on	1
the	1
dew-	1
besprinkled	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
on	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
on	1
the	1
windows,	1
the	1
fence,	1
and	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
horses	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
hut.	1
The	1
roar	1
of	1
guns	1
sounded	1
more	1
distinct	1
outside.	1
An	1
adjutant	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
Cossack	1
passed	1
by	1
at	1
a	1
sharp	1
trot.	1
	1
"It's	1
time,	1
Count;	1
it's	1
time!"	1
cried	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
Telling	1
the	1
groom	1
to	1
follow	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
horses,	1
Pierre	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
to	1
the	1
knoll	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
A	1
crowd	1
of	1
military	1
men	1
was	1
assembled	1
there,	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
conversing	1
in	1
French,	1
and	1
Kutuzov's	1
gray	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
band	1
was	1
visible,	1
his	1
gray	1
nape	1
sunk	1
between	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
through	1
a	1
field	1
glass	1
down	1
the	1
highroad	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
Mounting	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
knoll	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
scene	1
before	1
him,	1
spellbound	1
by	1
beauty.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
panorama	1
he	1
had	1
admired	1
from	1
that	1
spot	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
troops	1
and	1
covered	1
by	1
smoke	1
clouds	1
from	1
the	1
guns,	1
and	1
the	1
slanting	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
bright	1
sun,	1
rising	1
slightly	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
behind	1
Pierre,	1
cast	1
upon	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
clear	1
morning	1
air	1
penetrating	1
streaks	1
of	1
rosy,	1
golden-tinted	1
light	1
and	1
long	1
dark	1
shadows.	1
The	1
forest	1
at	1
the	1
farthest	1
extremity	1
of	1
the	1
panorama	1
seemed	1
carved	1
in	1
some	1
precious	1
stone	1
of	1
a	1
yellowish-green	1
color;	1
its	1
undulating	1
outline	1
was	1
silhouetted	1
against	1
the	1
horizon	1
and	1
was	1
pierced	1
beyond	1
Valuevo	1
by	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
highroad	1
crowded	1
with	1
troops.	1
Nearer	1
at	1
hand	1
glittered	1
golden	1
cornfields	1
interspersed	1
with	1
copses.	1
There	1
were	1
troops	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
everywhere,	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left.	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
vivid,	1
majestic,	1
and	1
unexpected;	1
but	1
what	1
impressed	1
Pierre	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield	1
itself,	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
hollows	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
Kolocha.	1
	1
Above	1
the	1
Kolocha,	1
in	1
Borodino	1
and	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
it,	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
where	1
the	1
Voyna	1
flowing	1
between	1
its	1
marshy	1
banks	1
falls	1
into	1
the	1
Kolocha,	1
a	1
mist	1
had	1
spread	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
melt,	1
to	1
dissolve,	1
and	1
to	1
become	1
translucent	1
when	1
the	1
brilliant	1
sun	1
appeared	1
and	1
magically	1
colored	1
and	1
outlined	1
everything.	1
The	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
guns	1
mingled	1
with	1
this	1
mist,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
expanse	1
and	1
through	1
that	1
mist	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
sun	1
were	1
reflected,	1
flashing	1
back	1
like	1
lightning	1
from	1
the	1
water,	1
from	1
the	1
dew,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
bayonets	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
crowded	1
together	1
by	1
the	1
riverbanks	1
and	1
in	1
Borodino.	1
A	1
white	1
church	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
the	1
mist,	1
and	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
huts	1
in	1
Borodino	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
dense	1
masses	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
or	1
green	1
ammunition	1
chests	1
and	1
ordnance.	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
moved,	1
or	1
seemed	1
to	1
move,	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
and	1
mist	1
spread	1
out	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
space.	1
Just	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
mist-enveloped	1
hollow	1
near	1
Borodino,	1
so	1
along	1
the	1
entire	1
line	1
outside	1
and	1
above	1
it	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
fields	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
in	1
the	1
valleys	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
summits	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
ground,	1
clouds	1
of	1
powder	1
smoke	1
seemed	1
continually	1
to	1
spring	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
nothing,	1
now	1
singly,	1
now	1
several	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
some	1
translucent,	1
others	1
dense,	1
which,	1
swelling,	1
growing,	1
rolling,	1
and	1
blending,	1
extended	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
expanse.	1
	1
These	1
puffs	1
of	1
smoke	1
and	1
(strange	1
to	1
say)	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
firing	1
produced	1
the	1
chief	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
spectacle.	1
	1
"Puff!"--suddenly	1
a	1
round	1
compact	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke	1
was	1
seen	1
merging	1
from	1
violet	1
into	1
gray	1
and	1
milky	1
white,	1
and	1
"boom!"	1
came	1
the	1
report	1
a	1
second	1
later.	1
	1
"Puff!	1
puff!"--and	1
two	1
clouds	1
arose	1
pushing	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
blending	1
together;	1
and	1
"boom,	1
boom!"	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
confirming	1
what	1
the	1
eye	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
cloud,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
as	1
a	1
round	1
compact	1
ball,	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
place	1
already	1
were	1
balloons	1
of	1
smoke	1
floating	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
and--"puff"	1
(with	1
a	1
pause)--"puff,	1
puff!"	1
three	1
and	1
then	1
four	1
more	1
appeared	1
and	1
then	1
from	1
each,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
interval--"boom--	1
boom,	1
boom!"	1
came	1
the	1
fine,	1
firm,	1
precise	1
sounds	1
in	1
reply.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
those	1
smoke	1
clouds	1
sometimes	1
ran	1
and	1
sometimes	1
stood	1
still	1
while	1
woods,	1
fields,	1
and	1
glittering	1
bayonets	1
ran	1
past	1
them.	1
From	1
the	1
left,	1
over	1
fields	1
and	1
bushes,	1
those	1
large	1
balls	1
of	1
smoke	1
were	1
continually	1
appearing	1
followed	1
by	1
their	1
solemn	1
reports,	1
while	1
nearer	1
still,	1
in	1
the	1
hollows	1
and	1
woods,	1
there	1
burst	1
from	1
the	1
muskets	1
small	1
cloudlets	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
become	1
balls,	1
but	1
had	1
their	1
little	1
echoes	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
"Trakh-ta-ta-takh!"	1
came	1
the	1
frequent	1
crackle	1
of	1
musketry,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
irregular	1
and	1
feeble	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
cannon.	1
	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
with	1
that	1
smoke,	1
those	1
shining	1
bayonets,	1
that	1
movement,	1
and	1
those	1
sounds.	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
his	1
suite,	1
to	1
compare	1
his	1
impressions	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
others.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feelings.	1
All	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
now	1
shining	1
with	1
that	1
latent	1
warmth	1
of	1
feeling	1
Pierre	1
had	1
noticed	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
fully	1
understood	1
after	1
his	1
talk	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Go,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
go...	1
and	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you!"	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
stood	1
beside	1
him,	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
eye	1
from	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
	1
Having	1
received	1
this	1
order	1
the	1
general	1
passed	1
by	1
Pierre	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
down	1
the	1
knoll.	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
crossing!"	1
said	1
the	1
general	1
coldly	1
and	1
sternly	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
who	1
asked	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going.	1
	1
"I'll	1
go	1
there	1
too,	1
I	1
too!"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
followed	1
the	1
general.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
mounted	1
a	1
horse	1
a	1
Cossack	1
had	1
brought	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
groom	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
his	1
horses	1
and,	1
asking	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
quietest,	1
clambered	1
onto	1
it,	1
seized	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
mane,	1
and	1
turning	1
out	1
his	1
toes	1
pressed	1
his	1
heels	1
against	1
its	1
sides	1
and,	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
spectacles	1
were	1
slipping	1
off	1
but	1
unable	1
to	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
the	1
mane	1
and	1
reins,	1
he	1
galloped	1
after	1
the	1
general,	1
causing	1
the	1
staff	1
officers	1
to	1
smile	1
as	1
they	1
watched	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
knoll.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXI	1
	1
Having	1
descended	1
the	1
hill	1
the	1
general	1
after	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
was	1
galloping	1
turned	1
sharply	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
losing	1
sight	1
of	1
him,	1
galloped	1
in	1
among	1
some	1
ranks	1
of	1
infantry	1
marching	1
ahead	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
pass	1
either	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
or	1
left,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
soldiers	1
everywhere,	1
all	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
preoccupied	1
expression	1
and	1
busy	1
with	1
some	1
unseen	1
but	1
evidently	1
important	1
task.	1
They	1
all	1
gazed	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
dissatisfied	1
and	1
inquiring	1
expression	1
at	1
this	1
stout	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
hat,	1
who	1
for	1
some	1
unknown	1
reason	1
threatened	1
to	1
trample	1
them	1
under	1
his	1
horse's	1
hoofs.	1
	1
"Why	1
ride	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
battalion?"	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
shouted	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
Another	1
prodded	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
butt	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
musket,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
bending	1
over	1
his	1
saddlebow	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
control	1
his	1
shying	1
horse,	1
galloped	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
free	1
space.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
bridge	1
ahead	1
of	1
him,	1
where	1
other	1
soldiers	1
stood	1
firing.	1
Pierre	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
Without	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
across	1
the	1
Kolocha	1
between	1
Gorki	1
and	1
Borodino,	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
(having	1
occupied	1
Borodino)	1
were	1
attacking	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
phase	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
bridge	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
soldiers	1
were	1
doing	1
something	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meadow,	1
among	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
new-mown	1
hay	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
campfires	1
the	1
day	1
before;	1
but	1
despite	1
the	1
incessant	1
firing	1
going	1
on	1
there	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
bullets	1
whistling	1
from	1
every	1
side,	1
or	1
the	1
projectiles	1
that	1
flew	1
over	1
him,	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
enemy	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded,	1
though	1
many	1
fell	1
near	1
him.	1
He	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Why's	1
that	1
fellow	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
line?"	1
shouted	1
somebody	1
at	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
left!...	1
Keep	1
to	1
the	1
right!"	1
the	1
men	1
shouted	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
encountered	1
one	1
of	1
Raevski's	1
adjutants	1
whom	1
he	1
knew.	1
The	1
adjutant	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
him,	1
evidently	1
also	1
intending	1
to	1
shout	1
at	1
him,	1
but	1
on	1
recognizing	1
him	1
he	1
nodded.	1
	1
"How	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
here?"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
galloped	1
on.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
feeling	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
there,	1
having	1
nothing	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
afraid	1
of	1
getting	1
in	1
someone's	1
way	1
again,	1
galloped	1
after	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"What's	1
happening	1
here?	1
May	1
I	1
come	1
with	1
you?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"One	1
moment,	1
one	1
moment!"	1
replied	1
the	1
adjutant,	1
and	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
stout	1
colonel	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
meadow,	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
some	1
message	1
and	1
then	1
addressed	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Why	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
here,	1
Count?"	1
he	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Still	1
inquisitive?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
assented	1
Pierre.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
adjutant	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
about	1
and	1
rode	1
on.	1
	1
"Here	1
it's	1
tolerable,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
with	1
Bagration	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
they're	1
getting	1
it	1
frightfully	1
hot."	1
	1
"Really?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Where	1
is	1
that?"	1
	1
"Come	1
along	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
our	1
knoll.	1
We	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
view	1
from	1
there	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
battery	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
bearable,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"Will	1
you	1
come?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I'll	1
come	1
with	1
you,"	1
replied	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
round	1
for	1
his	1
groom.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
noticed	1
wounded	1
men	1
staggering	1
along	1
or	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
stretchers.	1
On	1
that	1
very	1
meadow	1
he	1
had	1
ridden	1
over	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
a	1
soldier	1
was	1
lying	1
athwart	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
scented	1
hay,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
thrown	1
awkwardly	1
back	1
and	1
his	1
shako	1
off.	1
	1
"Why	1
haven't	1
they	1
carried	1
him	1
away?"	1
Pierre	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask,	1
but	1
seeing	1
the	1
stern	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
adjutant	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
looking	1
that	1
way,	1
he	1
checked	1
himself.	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
his	1
groom	1
and	1
rode	1
along	1
the	1
hollow	1
with	1
the	1
adjutant	1
to	1
Raevski's	1
Redoubt.	1
His	1
horse	1
lagged	1
behind	1
the	1
adjutant's	1
and	1
jolted	1
him	1
at	1
every	1
step.	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
to	1
riding,	1
Count?"	1
remarked	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"No	1
it's	1
not	1
that,	1
but	1
her	1
action	1
seems	1
so	1
jerky,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
in	1
a	1
puzzled	1
tone.	1
	1
"Why...	1
she's	1
wounded!"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"In	1
the	1
off	1
foreleg	1
above	1
the	1
knee.	1
A	1
bullet,	1
no	1
doubt.	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you,	1
Count,	1
on	1
your	1
baptism	1
of	1
fire!"	1
	1
Having	1
ridden	1
in	1
the	1
smoke	1
past	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Corps,	1
behind	1
the	1
artillery	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
moved	1
forward	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
action,	1
deafening	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
firing,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
wood.	1
There	1
it	1
was	1
cool	1
and	1
quiet,	1
with	1
a	1
scent	1
of	1
autumn.	1
Pierre	1
and	1
the	1
adjutant	1
dismounted	1
and	1
walked	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
on	1
foot.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
general	1
here?"	1
asked	1
the	1
adjutant	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
knoll.	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
here	1
a	1
minute	1
ago	1
but	1
has	1
just	1
gone	1
that	1
way,"	1
someone	1
told	1
him,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
right.	1
	1
The	1
adjutant	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
as	1
if	1
puzzled	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
now.	1
	1
"Don't	1
trouble	1
about	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"I'll	1
go	1
up	1
onto	1
the	1
knoll	1
if	1
I	1
may?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
do.	1
You'll	1
see	1
everything	1
from	1
there	1
and	1
it's	1
less	1
dangerous,	1
and	1
I'll	1
come	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
battery	1
and	1
the	1
adjutant	1
rode	1
on.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
meet	1
again,	1
and	1
only	1
much	1
later	1
did	1
Pierre	1
learn	1
that	1
he	1
lost	1
an	1
arm	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
The	1
knoll	1
to	1
which	1
Pierre	1
ascended	1
was	1
that	1
famous	1
one	1
afterwards	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
Russians	1
as	1
the	1
Knoll	1
Battery	1
or	1
Raevski's	1
Redoubt,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
as	1
la	1
grande	1
redoute,	1
la	1
fatale	1
redoute,	1
la	1
redoute	1
du	1
centre,	1
around	1
which	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
fell,	1
and	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
key	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
position.	1
	1
This	1
redoubt	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
knoll,	1
on	1
three	1
sides	1
of	1
which	1
trenches	1
had	1
been	1
dug.	1
Within	1
the	1
entrenchment	1
stood	1
ten	1
guns	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
fired	1
through	1
openings	1
in	1
the	1
earthwork.	1
	1
In	1
line	1
with	1
the	1
knoll	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
stood	1
other	1
guns	1
which	1
also	1
fired	1
incessantly.	1
A	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
guns	1
stood	1
infantry.	1
When	1
ascending	1
that	1
knoll	1
Pierre	1
had	1
no	1
notion	1
that	1
this	1
spot,	1
on	1
which	1
small	1
trenches	1
had	1
been	1
dug	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
few	1
guns	1
were	1
firing,	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
significant	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
Having	1
reached	1
the	1
knoll,	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
trench	1
surrounding	1
the	1
battery	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
unconsciously	1
happy	1
smile.	1
Occasionally	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
battery	1
still	1
with	1
that	1
same	1
smile,	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
obstruct	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
loading,	1
hauling	1
the	1
guns,	1
and	1
continually	1
running	1
past	1
him	1
with	1
bags	1
and	1
charges.	1
The	1
guns	1
of	1
that	1
battery	1
were	1
being	1
fired	1
continually	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
deafening	1
roar,	1
enveloping	1
the	1
whole	1
neighborhood	1
in	1
powder	1
smoke.	1
	1
In	1
contrast	1
with	1
the	1
dread	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
infantrymen	1
placed	1
in	1
support,	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
battery	1
where	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
busy	1
at	1
their	1
work	1
were	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
by	1
a	1
trench,	1
everyone	1
experienced	1
a	1
common	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
family	1
feeling	1
of	1
animation.	1
	1
The	1
intrusion	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
nonmilitary	1
figure	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
hat	1
made	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
at	1
first.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
looked	1
askance	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
surprise	1
and	1
even	1
alarm	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
past	1
him.	1
The	1
senior	1
artillery	1
officer,	1
a	1
tall,	1
long-legged,	1
pockmarked	1
man,	1
moved	1
over	1
to	1
Pierre	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
farthest	1
gun	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
curiosity.	1
	1
A	1
young	1
round-faced	1
officer,	1
quite	1
a	1
boy	1
still	1
and	1
evidently	1
only	1
just	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Cadet	1
College,	1
who	1
was	1
zealously	1
commanding	1
the	1
two	1
guns	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
addressed	1
Pierre	1
sternly.	1
	1
"Sir,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"permit	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
stand	1
aside.	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
here."	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
shook	1
their	1
heads	1
disapprovingly	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
convinced	1
themselves	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
hat	1
was	1
doing	1
no	1
harm,	1
but	1
either	1
sat	1
quietly	1
on	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
the	1
trench	1
with	1
a	1
shy	1
smile	1
or,	1
politely	1
making	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
battery	1
under	1
fire	1
as	1
calmly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
on	1
a	1
boulevard,	1
their	1
feeling	1
of	1
hostile	1
distrust	1
gradually	1
began	1
to	1
change	1
into	1
a	1
kindly	1
and	1
bantering	1
sympathy,	1
such	1
as	1
soldiers	1
feel	1
for	1
their	1
dogs,	1
cocks,	1
goats,	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
for	1
the	1
animals	1
that	1
live	1
with	1
the	1
regiment.	1
The	1
men	1
soon	1
accepted	1
Pierre	1
into	1
their	1
family,	1
adopted	1
him,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
nickname	1
("our	1
gentleman"),	1
and	1
made	1
kindly	1
fun	1
of	1
him	1
among	1
themselves.	1
	1
A	1
shell	1
tore	1
up	1
the	1
earth	1
two	1
paces	1
from	1
Pierre	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
around	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
as	1
he	1
brushed	1
from	1
his	1
clothes	1
some	1
earth	1
it	1
had	1
thrown	1
up.	1
	1
"And	1
how's	1
it	1
you're	1
not	1
afraid,	1
sir,	1
really	1
now?"	1
a	1
red-faced,	1
broad-	1
shouldered	1
soldier	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
grin	1
that	1
disclosed	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
sound,	1
white	1
teeth.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
afraid,	1
then?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"What	1
else	1
do	1
you	1
expect?"	1
answered	1
the	1
soldier.	1
"She	1
has	1
no	1
mercy,	1
you	1
know!	1
When	1
she	1
comes	1
spluttering	1
down,	1
out	1
go	1
your	1
innards.	1
One	1
can't	1
help	1
being	1
afraid,"	1
he	1
said	1
laughing.	1
	1
Several	1
of	1
the	1
men,	1
with	1
bright	1
kindly	1
faces,	1
stopped	1
beside	1
Pierre.	1
They	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
expected	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
like	1
anybody	1
else,	1
and	1
the	1
discovery	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
delighted	1
them.	1
	1
"It's	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
us	1
soldiers.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
gentleman	1
it's	1
wonderful!	1
There's	1
a	1
gentleman	1
for	1
you!"	1
	1
"To	1
your	1
places!"	1
cried	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
gathered	1
round	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
officer	1
was	1
evidently	1
exercising	1
his	1
duties	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
or	1
second	1
time	1
and	1
therefore	1
treated	1
both	1
his	1
superiors	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
with	1
great	1
precision	1
and	1
formality.	1
	1
The	1
booming	1
cannonade	1
and	1
the	1
fusillade	1
of	1
musketry	1
were	1
growing	1
more	1
intense	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
field,	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
where	1
Bagration's	1
fleches	1
were,	1
but	1
where	1
Pierre	1
was	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
firing	1
made	1
it	1
almost	1
impossible	1
to	1
distinguish	1
anything.	1
Moreover,	1
his	1
whole	1
attention	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
watching	1
the	1
family	1
circle--separated	1
from	1
all	1
else--	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
battery.	1
His	1
first	1
unconscious	1
feeling	1
of	1
joyful	1
animation	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
sights	1
and	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield	1
was	1
now	1
replaced	1
by	1
another,	1
especially	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
that	1
soldier	1
lying	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
hayfield.	1
Now,	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
the	1
trench,	1
he	1
observed	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
By	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
some	1
twenty	1
men	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
battery;	1
two	1
guns	1
were	1
smashed	1
and	1
cannon	1
balls	1
fell	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
on	1
the	1
battery	1
and	1
spent	1
bullets	1
buzzed	1
and	1
whistled	1
around.	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
battery	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
this,	1
and	1
merry	1
voices	1
and	1
jokes	1
were	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
	1
"A	1
live	1
one!"	1
shouted	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
whistling	1
shell	1
approached.	1
	1
"Not	1
this	1
way!	1
To	1
the	1
infantry!"	1
added	1
another	1
with	1
loud	1
laughter,	1
seeing	1
the	1
shell	1
fly	1
past	1
and	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
supports.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
bowing	1
to	1
a	1
friend,	1
eh?"	1
remarked	1
another,	1
chaffing	1
a	1
peasant	1
who	1
ducked	1
low	1
as	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
flew	1
over.	1
	1
Several	1
soldiers	1
gathered	1
by	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
trench,	1
looking	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
front.	1
	1
"They've	1
withdrawn	1
the	1
front	1
line,	1
it	1
has	1
retired,"	1
said	1
they,	1
pointing	1
over	1
the	1
earthwork.	1
	1
"Mind	1
your	1
own	1
business,"	1
an	1
old	1
sergeant	1
shouted	1
at	1
them.	1
"If	1
they've	1
retired	1
it's	1
because	1
there's	1
work	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
farther	1
back."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
sergeant,	1
taking	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
shove	1
with	1
his	1
knee.	1
This	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
laughter.	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
fifth	1
gun,	1
wheel	1
it	1
up!"	1
came	1
shouts	1
from	1
one	1
side.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
all	1
together,	1
like	1
bargees!"	1
rose	1
the	1
merry	1
voices	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
moving	1
the	1
gun.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
she	1
nearly	1
knocked	1
our	1
gentleman's	1
hat	1
off!"	1
cried	1
the	1
red-faced	1
humorist,	1
showing	1
his	1
teeth	1
chaffing	1
Pierre.	1
"Awkward	1
baggage!"	1
he	1
added	1
reproachfully	1
to	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
that	1
struck	1
a	1
cannon	1
wheel	1
and	1
a	1
man's	1
leg.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
you	1
foxes!"	1
said	1
another,	1
laughing	1
at	1
some	1
militiamen	1
who,	1
stooping	1
low,	1
entered	1
the	1
battery	1
to	1
carry	1
away	1
the	1
wounded	1
man.	1
	1
"So	1
this	1
gruel	1
isn't	1
to	1
your	1
taste?	1
Oh,	1
you	1
crows!	1
You're	1
scared!"	1
they	1
shouted	1
at	1
the	1
militiamen	1
who	1
stood	1
hesitating	1
before	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
leg	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
off.	1
	1
"There,	1
lads...	1
oh,	1
oh!"	1
they	1
mimicked	1
the	1
peasants,	1
"they	1
don't	1
like	1
it	1
at	1
all!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
after	1
every	1
ball	1
that	1
hit	1
the	1
redoubt,	1
and	1
after	1
every	1
loss,	1
the	1
liveliness	1
increased	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
As	1
the	1
flames	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
hidden	1
within	1
come	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
vividly	1
and	1
rapidly	1
from	1
an	1
approaching	1
thundercloud,	1
so,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place,	1
the	1
lightning	1
of	1
hidden	1
fire	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
intense	1
glowed	1
in	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
these	1
men.	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
battlefield	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
concerned	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
there;	1
he	1
was	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
watching	1
this	1
fire	1
which	1
burned	1
ever	1
more	1
brightly	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
was	1
flaming	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
At	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
the	1
infantry	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
among	1
the	1
bushes	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
battery	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
Kamenka	1
streamlet	1
retreated.	1
From	1
the	1
battery	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
running	1
back	1
past	1
it	1
carrying	1
their	1
wounded	1
on	1
their	1
muskets.	1
A	1
general	1
with	1
his	1
suite	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
battery,	1
and	1
after	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
gave	1
Pierre	1
an	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
having	1
ordered	1
the	1
infantry	1
supports	1
behind	1
the	1
battery	1
to	1
lie	1
down,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
exposed	1
to	1
fire.	1
After	1
this	1
from	1
amid	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
infantry	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
battery	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
drum	1
and	1
shouts	1
of	1
command,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
battery	1
one	1
saw	1
how	1
those	1
ranks	1
of	1
infantry	1
moved	1
forward.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
over	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
trench	1
and	1
was	1
particularly	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
pale	1
young	1
officer	1
who,	1
letting	1
his	1
sword	1
hang	1
down,	1
was	1
walking	1
backwards	1
and	1
kept	1
glancing	1
uneasily	1
around.	1
	1
The	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
infantry	1
disappeared	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
but	1
their	1
long-	1
drawn	1
shout	1
and	1
rapid	1
musketry	1
firing	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
heard.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
crowds	1
of	1
wounded	1
men	1
and	1
stretcher-bearers	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
that	1
direction.	1
Projectiles	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
still	1
more	1
frequently	1
in	1
the	1
battery.	1
Several	1
men	1
were	1
lying	1
about	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
removed.	1
Around	1
the	1
cannon	1
the	1
men	1
moved	1
still	1
more	1
briskly	1
and	1
busily.	1
No	1
one	1
any	1
longer	1
took	1
notice	1
of	1
Pierre.	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
he	1
was	1
shouted	1
at	1
for	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
The	1
senior	1
officer	1
moved	1
with	1
big,	1
rapid	1
strides	1
from	1
one	1
gun	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
frowning	1
face.	1
The	1
young	1
officer,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
still	1
more	1
flushed,	1
commanded	1
the	1
men	1
more	1
scrupulously	1
than	1
ever.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
handed	1
up	1
the	1
charges,	1
turned,	1
loaded,	1
and	1
did	1
their	1
business	1
with	1
strained	1
smartness.	1
They	1
gave	1
little	1
jumps	1
as	1
they	1
walked,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
springs.	1
	1
The	1
stormcloud	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
face	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
watched	1
kindle	1
burned	1
up	1
brightly.	1
Pierre	1
standing	1
beside	1
the	1
commanding	1
officer.	1
The	1
young	1
officer,	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
shako,	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
superior.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
report,	1
sir,	1
that	1
only	1
eight	1
rounds	1
are	1
left.	1
Are	1
we	1
to	1
continue	1
firing?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Grapeshot!"	1
the	1
senior	1
shouted,	1
without	1
answering	1
the	1
question,	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
trench.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
something	1
happened:	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
gave	1
a	1
gasp	1
and	1
bending	1
double	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
shot	1
on	1
the	1
wing.	1
Everything	1
became	1
strange,	1
confused,	1
and	1
misty	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
	1
One	1
cannon	1
ball	1
after	1
another	1
whistled	1
by	1
and	1
struck	1
the	1
earthwork,	1
a	1
soldier,	1
or	1
a	1
gun.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
these	1
sounds	1
before,	1
now	1
heard	1
nothing	1
else.	1
On	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
battery	1
soldiers	1
shouting	1
"Hurrah!"	1
were	1
running	1
not	1
forwards	1
but	1
backwards,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
A	1
cannon	1
ball	1
struck	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
work	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
standing,	1
crumbling	1
down	1
the	1
earth;	1
a	1
black	1
ball	1
flashed	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
plumped	1
into	1
something.	1
Some	1
militiamen	1
who	1
were	1
entering	1
the	1
battery	1
ran	1
back.	1
	1
"All	1
with	1
grapeshot!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
The	1
sergeant	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
whisper	1
informed	1
him	1
(as	1
a	1
butler	1
at	1
dinner	1
informs	1
his	1
master	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
some	1
wine	1
asked	1
for)	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
charges.	1
	1
"The	1
scoundrels!	1
What	1
are	1
they	1
doing?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
officer,	1
turning	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
officer's	1
face	1
was	1
red	1
and	1
perspiring	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
glittered	1
under	1
his	1
frowning	1
brow.	1
	1
"Run	1
to	1
the	1
reserves	1
and	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
ammunition	1
boxes!"	1
he	1
yelled,	1
angrily	1
avoiding	1
Pierre	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
speaking	1
to	1
his	1
men.	1
	1
"I'll	1
go,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
officer,	1
without	1
answering	1
him,	1
strode	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
side.	1
	1
"Don't	1
fire....	1
Wait!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
ammunition	1
stumbled	1
against	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
sir,	1
this	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
slope.	1
	1
Pierre	1
ran	1
after	1
him,	1
avoiding	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
was	1
sitting.	1
	1
One	1
cannon	1
ball,	1
another,	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
flew	1
over	1
him,	1
falling	1
in	1
front,	1
beside,	1
and	1
behind	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
slope.	1
"Where	1
am	1
I	1
going?"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
asked	1
himself	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
near	1
the	1
green	1
ammunition	1
wagons.	1
He	1
halted	1
irresolutely,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whether	1
to	1
return	1
or	1
go	1
on.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
terrible	1
concussion	1
threw	1
him	1
backwards	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
he	1
was	1
dazzled	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
flash	1
of	1
flame,	1
and	1
immediately	1
a	1
deafening	1
roar,	1
crackling,	1
and	1
whistling	1
made	1
his	1
ears	1
tingle.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
hands;	1
the	1
ammunition	1
wagons	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
approaching	1
no	1
longer	1
existed,	1
only	1
charred	1
green	1
boards	1
and	1
rags	1
littered	1
the	1
scorched	1
grass,	1
and	1
a	1
horse,	1
dangling	1
fragments	1
of	1
its	1
shaft	1
behind	1
it,	1
galloped	1
past,	1
while	1
another	1
horse	1
lay,	1
like	1
Pierre,	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
uttering	1
prolonged	1
and	1
piercing	1
cries.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXII	1
	1
Beside	1
himself	1
with	1
terror	1
Pierre	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
battery,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
only	1
refuge	1
from	1
the	1
horrors	1
that	1
surrounded	1
him.	1
	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
earthwork	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
men	1
doing	1
something	1
there	1
but	1
that	1
no	1
shots	1
were	1
being	1
fired	1
from	1
the	1
battery.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
realize	1
who	1
these	1
men	1
were.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
senior	1
officer	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
wall	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
turned	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
examining	1
something	1
down	1
below	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
before	1
was	1
struggling	1
forward	1
shouting	1
"Brothers!"	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
free	1
himself	1
from	1
some	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
holding	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm.	1
He	1
also	1
saw	1
something	1
else	1
that	1
was	1
strange.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
realize	1
that	1
the	1
colonel	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
that	1
the	1
soldier	1
shouting	1
"Brothers!"	1
was	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
and	1
that	1
another	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
bayoneted	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
for	1
hardly	1
had	1
he	1
run	1
into	1
the	1
redoubt	1
before	1
a	1
thin,	1
sallow-faced,	1
perspiring	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
uniform	1
rushed	1
on	1
him	1
sword	1
in	1
hand,	1
shouting	1
something.	1
Instinctively	1
guarding	1
against	1
the	1
shock--for	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
running	1
together	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
before	1
they	1
saw	1
one	1
another--Pierre	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
seized	1
the	1
man	1
(a	1
French	1
officer)	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
throat	1
with	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
officer,	1
dropping	1
his	1
sword,	1
seized	1
Pierre	1
by	1
his	1
collar.	1
	1
For	1
some	1
seconds	1
they	1
gazed	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
at	1
one	1
another's	1
unfamiliar	1
faces	1
and	1
both	1
were	1
perplexed	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
next.	1
"Am	1
I	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
or	1
have	1
I	1
taken	1
him	1
prisoner?"	1
each	1
was	1
thinking.	1
But	1
the	1
French	1
officer	1
was	1
evidently	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
because	1
Pierre's	1
strong	1
hand,	1
impelled	1
by	1
instinctive	1
fear,	1
squeezed	1
his	1
throat	1
ever	1
tighter	1
and	1
tighter.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
when	1
just	1
above	1
their	1
heads,	1
terrible	1
and	1
low,	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
whistled,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
officer's	1
head	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
off,	1
so	1
swiftly	1
had	1
he	1
ducked	1
it.	1
	1
Pierre	1
too	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
hands	1
fall.	1
Without	1
further	1
thought	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
whom	1
prisoner,	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
battery	1
and	1
Pierre	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
slope	1
stumbling	1
over	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded	1
who,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
caught	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
knoll	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
dense	1
crowd	1
of	1
Russian	1
soldiers	1
who,	1
stumbling,	1
tripping	1
up,	1
and	1
shouting,	1
ran	1
merrily	1
and	1
wildly	1
toward	1
the	1
battery.	1
(This	1
was	1
the	1
attack	1
for	1
which	1
Ermolov	1
claimed	1
the	1
credit,	1
declaring	1
that	1
only	1
his	1
courage	1
and	1
good	1
luck	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
feat	1
possible:	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
attack	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
thrown	1
some	1
St.	1
George's	1
Crosses	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
into	1
the	1
battery	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
soldiers	1
to	1
take	1
who	1
got	1
there.)	1
	1
The	1
French	1
who	1
had	1
occupied	1
the	1
battery	1
fled,	1
and	1
our	1
troops	1
shouting	1
"Hurrah!"	1
pursued	1
them	1
so	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
battery	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
back.	1
	1
The	1
prisoners	1
were	1
brought	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
battery	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
wounded	1
French	1
general,	1
whom	1
the	1
officers	1
surrounded.	1
Crowds	1
of	1
wounded-	1
-some	1
known	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
some	1
unknown--Russians	1
and	1
French,	1
with	1
faces	1
distorted	1
by	1
suffering,	1
walked,	1
crawled,	1
and	1
were	1
carried	1
on	1
stretchers	1
from	1
the	1
battery.	1
Pierre	1
again	1
went	1
up	1
onto	1
the	1
knoll	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
over	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
family	1
circle	1
which	1
had	1
received	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
member	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
single	1
one.	1
There	1
were	1
many	1
dead	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
some	1
he	1
recognized.	1
The	1
young	1
officer	1
still	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
bent	1
double,	1
in	1
a	1
pool	1
of	1
blood	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
wall.	1
The	1
red-faced	1
man	1
was	1
still	1
twitching,	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
Pierre	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
slope	1
once	1
more.	1
	1
"Now	1
they	1
will	1
stop	1
it,	1
now	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
horrified	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
done!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
aimlessly	1
going	1
toward	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
stretcher	1
bearers	1
moving	1
from	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
	1
But	1
behind	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
smoke	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
still	1
high,	1
and	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
near	1
Semenovsk,	1
something	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
seething	1
in	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
cannon	1
and	1
musketry	1
did	1
not	1
diminish,	1
but	1
even	1
increased	1
to	1
desperation	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
straining	1
himself,	1
shrieks	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
remaining	1
strength.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXIII	1
	1
The	1
chief	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
fought	1
within	1
the	1
seven	1
thousand	1
feet	1
between	1
Borodino	1
and	1
Bagration's	1
fleches.	1
Beyond	1
that	1
space	1
there	1
was,	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
a	1
demonstration	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
Russians	1
with	1
Uvarov's	1
cavalry	1
at	1
midday,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
beyond	1
Utitsa,	1
Poniatowski's	1
collision	1
with	1
Tuchkov;	1
but	1
these	1
two	1
were	1
detached	1
and	1
feeble	1
actions	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
what	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
On	1
the	1
field	1
between	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
fleches,	1
beside	1
the	1
wood,	1
the	1
chief	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
took	1
place	1
on	1
an	1
open	1
space	1
visible	1
from	1
both	1
sides	1
and	1
was	1
fought	1
in	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
artless	1
way.	1
	1
The	1
battle	1
began	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
with	1
a	1
cannonade	1
from	1
several	1
hundred	1
guns.	1
	1
Then	1
when	1
the	1
whole	1
field	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
smoke,	1
two	1
divisions,	1
Campan's	1
and	1
Dessaix's,	1
advanced	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
right,	1
while	1
Murat's	1
troops	1
advanced	1
on	1
Borodino	1
from	1
their	1
left.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt	1
where	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
standing	1
the	1
fleches	1
were	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
away,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
as	1
the	1
crow	1
flies	1
to	1
Borodino,	1
so	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
there,	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
mist	1
hid	1
the	1
whole	1
locality.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
of	1
Dessaix's	1
division	1
advancing	1
against	1
the	1
fleches	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
seen	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
hollow	1
that	1
lay	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
fleches.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
descended	1
into	1
that	1
hollow,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
musketry	1
on	1
the	1
fleches	1
grew	1
so	1
dense	1
that	1
it	1
covered	1
the	1
whole	1
approach	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
it.	1
Through	1
the	1
smoke	1
glimpses	1
could	1
be	1
caught	1
of	1
something	1
black--probably	1
men--and	1
at	1
times	1
the	1
glint	1
of	1
bayonets.	1
But	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
moving	1
or	1
stationary,	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
French	1
or	1
Russian,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
discovered	1
from	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
Redoubt.	1
	1
The	1
sun	1
had	1
risen	1
brightly	1
and	1
its	1
slanting	1
rays	1
struck	1
straight	1
into	1
Napoleon's	1
face	1
as,	1
shading	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fleches.	1
The	1
smoke	1
spread	1
out	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
it	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
smoke	1
were	1
moving,	1
at	1
times	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
troops	1
moved.	1
Sometimes	1
shouts	1
were	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
firing,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
there.	1
	1
Napoleon,	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
knoll,	1
looked	1
through	1
a	1
field	1
glass,	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
small	1
circlet	1
saw	1
smoke	1
and	1
men,	1
sometimes	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
sometimes	1
Russians,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
eye,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
where	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
was.	1
	1
He	1
descended	1
the	1
knoll	1
and	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
before	1
it.	1
	1
Occasionally	1
he	1
stopped,	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
firing,	1
and	1
gazed	1
intently	1
at	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
	1
But	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
from	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
down	1
below,	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
knoll	1
above	1
on	1
which	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
generals	1
had	1
taken	1
their	1
stand,	1
but	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
fleches	1
themselves--in	1
which	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
Russian	1
and	1
now	1
French	1
soldiers,	1
alternately	1
or	1
together,	1
dead,	1
wounded,	1
alive,	1
frightened,	1
or	1
maddened--	1
even	1
at	1
those	1
fleches	1
themselves	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place.	1
There	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
amid	1
incessant	1
cannon	1
and	1
musketry	1
fire,	1
now	1
Russians	1
were	1
seen	1
alone,	1
now	1
Frenchmen	1
alone,	1
now	1
infantry,	1
and	1
now	1
cavalry:	1
they	1
appeared,	1
fired,	1
fell,	1
collided,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
one	1
another,	1
screamed,	1
and	1
ran	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
battlefield	1
adjutants	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
out,	1
and	1
orderlies	1
from	1
his	1
marshals,	1
kept	1
galloping	1
up	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
action,	1
but	1
all	1
these	1
reports	1
were	1
false,	1
both	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
battle	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
at	1
any	1
given	1
moment	1
and	1
because	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
adjutants	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
actual	1
place	1
of	1
conflict	1
but	1
reported	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
others;	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
while	1
an	1
adjutant	1
was	1
riding	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
circumstances	1
changed	1
and	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
brought	1
was	1
already	1
becoming	1
false.	1
Thus	1
an	1
adjutant	1
galloped	1
up	1
from	1
Murat	1
with	1
tidings	1
that	1
Borodino	1
had	1
been	1
occupied	1
and	1
the	1
bridge	1
over	1
the	1
Kolocha	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
The	1
adjutant	1
asked	1
whether	1
Napoleon	1
wished	1
the	1
troops	1
to	1
cross	1
it?	1
Napoleon	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
the	1
troops	1
should	1
form	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
and	1
wait.	1
But	1
before	1
that	1
order	1
was	1
given--almost	1
as	1
soon	1
in	1
fact	1
as	1
the	1
adjutant	1
had	1
left	1
Borodino--the	1
bridge	1
had	1
been	1
retaken	1
by	1
the	1
Russians	1
and	1
burned,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
skirmish	1
at	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
An	1
adjutant	1
galloped	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
fleches	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
and	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
reported	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
that	1
their	1
attack	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed,	1
Campan	1
wounded,	1
and	1
Davout	1
killed;	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
the	1
adjutant	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed,	1
the	1
fleches	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
been	1
recaptured	1
by	1
other	1
French	1
troops,	1
and	1
Davout	1
was	1
alive	1
and	1
only	1
slightly	1
bruised.	1
On	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
these	1
necessarily	1
untrustworthy	1
reports	1
Napoleon	1
gave	1
his	1
orders,	1
which	1
had	1
either	1
been	1
executed	1
before	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
or	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
executed.	1
	1
The	1
marshals	1
and	1
generals,	1
who	1
were	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
but,	1
like	1
Napoleon,	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
actual	1
fighting	1
and	1
only	1
occasionally	1
went	1
within	1
musket	1
range,	1
made	1
their	1
own	1
arrangements	1
without	1
asking	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
issued	1
orders	1
where	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
direction	1
to	1
fire	1
and	1
where	1
cavalry	1
should	1
gallop	1
and	1
infantry	1
should	1
run.	1
But	1
even	1
their	1
orders,	1
like	1
Napoleon's,	1
were	1
seldom	1
carried	1
out,	1
and	1
then	1
but	1
partially.	1
For	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
things	1
happened	1
contrary	1
to	1
their	1
orders.	1
Soldiers	1
ordered	1
to	1
advance	1
ran	1
back	1
on	1
meeting	1
grapeshot;	1
soldiers	1
ordered	1
to	1
remain	1
where	1
they	1
were,	1
suddenly,	1
seeing	1
Russians	1
unexpectedly	1
before	1
them,	1
sometimes	1
rushed	1
back	1
and	1
sometimes	1
forward,	1
and	1
the	1
cavalry	1
dashed	1
without	1
orders	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
Russians.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
two	1
cavalry	1
regiments	1
galloped	1
through	1
the	1
Semenovsk	1
hollow	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
incline	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
galloped	1
full	1
speed	1
back	1
again.	1
The	1
infantry	1
moved	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
sometimes	1
running	1
to	1
quite	1
other	1
places	1
than	1
those	1
they	1
were	1
ordered	1
to	1
go	1
to.	1
All	1
orders	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
and	1
when	1
to	1
move	1
the	1
guns,	1
when	1
to	1
send	1
infantry	1
to	1
shoot	1
or	1
horsemen	1
to	1
ride	1
down	1
the	1
Russian	1
infantry--all	1
such	1
orders	1
were	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
officers	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
nearest	1
to	1
the	1
units	1
concerned,	1
without	1
asking	1
either	1
Ney,	1
Davout,	1
or	1
Murat,	1
much	1
less	1
Napoleon.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
fear	1
getting	1
into	1
trouble	1
for	1
not	1
fulfilling	1
orders	1
or	1
for	1
acting	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
initiative,	1
for	1
in	1
battle	1
what	1
is	1
at	1
stake	1
is	1
what	1
is	1
dearest	1
to	1
man--his	1
own	1
life--and	1
it	1
sometimes	1
seems	1
that	1
safety	1
lies	1
in	1
running	1
back,	1
sometimes	1
in	1
running	1
forward;	1
and	1
these	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
acted	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
mood	1
of	1
the	1
moment.	1
In	1
reality,	1
however,	1
all	1
these	1
movements	1
forward	1
and	1
backward	1
did	1
not	1
improve	1
or	1
alter	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
troops.	1
All	1
their	1
rushing	1
and	1
galloping	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
did	1
little	1
harm,	1
the	1
harm	1
of	1
disablement	1
and	1
death	1
was	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
balls	1
and	1
bullets	1
that	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
fields	1
on	1
which	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
floundering	1
about.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
balls	1
and	1
bullets	1
were	1
flying	1
about,	1
their	1
superiors,	1
located	1
in	1
the	1
background,	1
re-formed	1
them	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
under	1
discipline	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
that	1
discipline	1
led	1
them	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
zone	1
of	1
fire,	1
where	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
they	1
lost	1
their	1
discipline	1
and	1
rushed	1
about	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
chance	1
promptings	1
of	1
the	1
throng.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXIV	1
	1
Napoleon's	1
generals--Davout,	1
Ney,	1
and	1
Murat,	1
who	1
were	1
near	1
that	1
region	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
sometimes	1
even	1
entered	1
it--repeatedly	1
led	1
into	1
it	1
huge	1
masses	1
of	1
well-ordered	1
troops.	1
But	1
contrary	1
to	1
what	1
had	1
always	1
happened	1
in	1
their	1
former	1
battles,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
news	1
they	1
expected	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
flight,	1
these	1
orderly	1
masses	1
returned	1
thence	1
as	1
disorganized	1
and	1
terrified	1
mobs.	1
The	1
generals	1
re-formed	1
them,	1
but	1
their	1
numbers	1
constantly	1
decreased.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
Murat	1
sent	1
his	1
adjutant	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
demand	1
reinforcements.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
knoll,	1
drinking	1
punch,	1
when	1
Murat's	1
adjutant	1
galloped	1
up	1
with	1
an	1
assurance	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
would	1
be	1
routed	1
if	1
His	1
Majesty	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
another	1
division.	1
	1
"Reinforcements?"	1
said	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
stern	1
surprise,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
adjutant--a	1
handsome	1
lad	1
with	1
long	1
black	1
curls	1
arranged	1
like	1
Murat's	1
own--as	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
"Reinforcements!"	1
thought	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
himself.	1
"How	1
can	1
they	1
need	1
reinforcements	1
when	1
they	1
already	1
have	1
half	1
the	1
army	1
directed	1
against	1
a	1
weak,	1
unentrenched	1
Russian	1
wing?"	1
	1
"Tell	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Naples,"	1
said	1
he	1
sternly,	1
"that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
noon	1
yet,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
yet	1
see	1
my	1
chessboard	1
clearly.	1
Go!..."	1
	1
The	1
handsome	1
boy	1
adjutant	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
hair	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
without	1
removing	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
galloped	1
back	1
to	1
where	1
men	1
were	1
being	1
slaughtered.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
rose	1
and	1
having	1
summoned	1
Caulaincourt	1
and	1
Berthier	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
them	1
about	1
matters	1
unconnected	1
with	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
conversation,	1
which	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
interest	1
Napoleon,	1
Berthier's	1
eyes	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
general	1
with	1
a	1
suite,	1
who	1
was	1
galloping	1
toward	1
the	1
knoll	1
on	1
a	1
lathering	1
horse.	1
It	1
was	1
Belliard.	1
Having	1
dismounted	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
with	1
rapid	1
strides	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
began	1
boldly	1
demonstrating	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
sending	1
reinforcements.	1
He	1
swore	1
on	1
his	1
honor	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
lost	1
if	1
the	1
Emperor	1
would	1
give	1
another	1
division.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
pace	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
without	1
replying.	1
Belliard	1
began	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
eagerly	1
to	1
the	1
generals	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
fiery,	1
Belliard,"	1
said	1
Napoleon,	1
when	1
he	1
again	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
general.	1
"In	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
mistake.	1
Go	1
and	1
have	1
another	1
look	1
and	1
then	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
Before	1
Belliard	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
a	1
messenger	1
from	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield	1
galloped	1
up.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
asked	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
irritated	1
at	1
being	1
continually	1
disturbed.	1
	1
"Sire,	1
the	1
prince..."	1
began	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"Asks	1
for	1
reinforcements?"	1
said	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
gesture.	1
	1
The	1
adjutant	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
affirmatively	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
report,	1
but	1
the	1
Emperor	1
turned	1
from	1
him,	1
took	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
steps,	1
stopped,	1
came	1
back,	1
and	1
called	1
Berthier.	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
give	1
reserves,"	1
he	1
said,	1
moving	1
his	1
arms	1
slightly	1
apart.	1
"Who	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
there?"	1
he	1
asked	1
of	1
Berthier	1
(whom	1
he	1
subsequently	1
termed	1
"that	1
gosling	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
an	1
eagle").	1
	1
"Send	1
Claparede's	1
division,	1
sire,"	1
replied	1
Berthier,	1
who	1
knew	1
all	1
the	1
division's	1
regiments,	1
and	1
battalions	1
by	1
heart.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
nodded	1
assent.	1
	1
The	1
adjutant	1
galloped	1
to	1
Claparede's	1
division	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
Young	1
Guards	1
stationed	1
behind	1
the	1
knoll	1
moved	1
forward.	1
Napoleon	1
gazed	1
silently	1
in	1
that	1
direction.	1
	1
"No!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
said	1
to	1
Berthier.	1
"I	1
can't	1
send	1
Claparede.	1
Send	1
Friant's	1
division."	1
	1
Though	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
advantage	1
in	1
sending	1
Friant's	1
division	1
instead	1
of	1
Claparede's,	1
and	1
even	1
an	1
obvious	1
inconvenience	1
and	1
delay	1
in	1
stopping	1
Claparede	1
and	1
sending	1
Friant	1
now,	1
the	1
order	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
exactly.	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
that	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
he	1
was	1
playing	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
doctor	1
who	1
hinders	1
by	1
his	1
medicines--a	1
role	1
he	1
so	1
justly	1
understood	1
and	1
condemned.	1
	1
Friant's	1
division	1
disappeared	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
done	1
into	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
From	1
all	1
sides	1
adjutants	1
continued	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
agreement	1
all	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
They	1
all	1
asked	1
for	1
reinforcements	1
and	1
all	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
holding	1
their	1
positions	1
and	1
maintaining	1
a	1
hellish	1
fire	1
under	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
was	1
melting	1
away.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
sat	1
on	1
a	1
campstool,	1
wrapped	1
in	1
thought.	1
	1
M.	1
de	1
Beausset,	1
the	1
man	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
travel,	1
having	1
fasted	1
since	1
morning,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
ventured	1
respectfully	1
to	1
suggest	1
lunch	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty.	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
I	1
may	1
now	1
congratulate	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
on	1
a	1
victory?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
silently	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
negation.	1
Assuming	1
the	1
negation	1
to	1
refer	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
victory	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
lunch,	1
M.	1
de	1
Beausset	1
ventured	1
with	1
respectful	1
jocularity	1
to	1
remark	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
lunch	1
when	1
one	1
can	1
get	1
it.	1
	1
"Go	1
away..."	1
exclaimed	1
Napoleon	1
suddenly	1
and	1
morosely,	1
and	1
turned	1
aside.	1
	1
A	1
beatific	1
smile	1
of	1
regret,	1
repentance,	1
and	1
ecstasy	1
beamed	1
on	1
M.	1
de	1
Beausset's	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
glided	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
generals.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
experiencing	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
depression	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
an	1
ever-	1
lucky	1
gambler	1
who,	1
after	1
recklessly	1
flinging	1
money	1
about	1
and	1
always	1
winning,	1
suddenly	1
just	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
calculated	1
all	1
the	1
chances	1
of	1
the	1
game,	1
finds	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
considers	1
his	1
play	1
the	1
more	1
surely	1
he	1
loses.	1
	1
His	1
troops	1
were	1
the	1
same,	1
his	1
generals	1
the	1
same,	1
the	1
same	1
preparations	1
had	1
been	1
made,	1
the	1
same	1
dispositions,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
proclamation	1
courte	1
et	1
energique,	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same:	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
even	1
more	1
experienced	1
and	1
skillful	1
than	1
before.	1
Even	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
at	1
Austerlitz	1
and	1
Friedland--yet	1
the	1
terrible	1
stroke	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
had	1
supernaturally	1
become	1
impotent.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
old	1
methods	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
unfailingly	1
crowned	1
with	1
success:	1
the	1
concentration	1
of	1
batteries	1
on	1
one	1
point,	1
an	1
attack	1
by	1
reserves	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
enemy's	1
line,	1
and	1
a	1
cavalry	1
attack	1
by	1
"the	1
men	1
of	1
iron,"	1
all	1
these	1
methods	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
employed,	1
yet	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
victory,	1
but	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
came	1
the	1
same	1
news	1
of	1
generals	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded,	1
of	1
reinforcements	1
needed,	1
of	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
driving	1
back	1
the	1
Russians,	1
and	1
of	1
disorganization	1
among	1
his	1
own	1
troops.	1
	1
Formerly,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
orders	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
few	1
phrases,	1
marshals	1
and	1
adjutants	1
had	1
come	1
galloping	1
up	1
with	1
congratulations	1
and	1
happy	1
faces,	1
announcing	1
the	1
trophies	1
taken,	1
the	1
corps	1
of	1
prisoners,	1
bundles	1
of	1
enemy	1
eagles	1
and	1
standards,	1
cannon	1
and	1
stores,	1
and	1
Murat	1
had	1
only	1
begged	1
leave	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
cavalry	1
to	1
gather	1
in	1
the	1
baggage	1
wagons.	1
So	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Lodi,	1
Marengo,	1
Arcola,	1
Jena,	1
Austerlitz,	1
Wagram,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
But	1
now	1
something	1
strange	1
was	1
happening	1
to	1
his	1
troops.	1
	1
Despite	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
the	1
fleches,	1
Napoleon	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
same,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
as	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
his	1
former	1
battles.	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
feeling	1
was	1
felt	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
about	1
him	1
experienced	1
in	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
war.	1
All	1
their	1
faces	1
looked	1
dejected,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
shunned	1
one	1
another's	1
eyes--only	1
a	1
de	1
Beausset	1
could	1
fail	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening.	1
	1
But	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
experience	1
of	1
war	1
well	1
knew	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
not	1
gained	1
by	1
the	1
attacking	1
side	1
in	1
eight	1
hours,	1
after	1
all	1
efforts	1
had	1
been	1
expended.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
lost	1
battle	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
least	1
accident	1
might	1
now--with	1
the	1
fight	1
balanced	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
strained	1
center--destroy	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
ran	1
his	1
mind	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
strange	1
Russian	1
campaign	1
in	1
which	1
not	1
one	1
battle	1
had	1
been	1
won,	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
not	1
a	1
flag,	1
or	1
cannon,	1
or	1
army	1
corps	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
in	1
two	1
months,	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
concealed	1
depression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
heard	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
still	1
holding	1
their	1
ground--a	1
terrible	1
feeling	1
like	1
a	1
nightmare	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
unlucky	1
accidents	1
that	1
might	1
destroy	1
him	1
occurred	1
to	1
his	1
mind.	1
The	1
Russians	1
might	1
fall	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
wing,	1
might	1
break	1
through	1
his	1
center,	1
he	1
himself	1
might	1
be	1
killed	1
by	1
a	1
stray	1
cannon	1
ball.	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
possible.	1
In	1
former	1
battles	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
considered	1
the	1
possibilities	1
of	1
success,	1
but	1
now	1
innumerable	1
unlucky	1
chances	1
presented	1
themselves,	1
and	1
he	1
expected	1
them	1
all.	1
Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
fancies	1
that	1
a	1
ruffian	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
attack	1
him,	1
and	1
raises	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
strike	1
that	1
ruffian	1
a	1
terrible	1
blow	1
which	1
he	1
knows	1
should	1
annihilate	1
him,	1
but	1
then	1
feels	1
that	1
his	1
arm	1
drops	1
powerless	1
and	1
limp	1
like	1
a	1
rag,	1
and	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
unavoidable	1
destruction	1
seizes	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
helplessness.	1
	1
The	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
attacking	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
aroused	1
that	1
horror	1
in	1
Napoleon.	1
He	1
sat	1
silently	1
on	1
a	1
campstool	1
below	1
the	1
knoll,	1
with	1
head	1
bowed	1
and	1
elbows	1
on	1
his	1
knees.	1
Berthier	1
approached	1
and	1
suggested	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
ride	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
to	1
ascertain	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
affairs.	1
	1
"What?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
say?"	1
asked	1
Napoleon.	1
"Yes,	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
me	1
my	1
horse."	1
	1
He	1
mounted	1
and	1
rode	1
toward	1
Semenovsk.	1
	1
Amid	1
the	1
powder	1
smoke,	1
slowly	1
dispersing	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
space	1
through	1
which	1
Napoleon	1
rode,	1
horses	1
and	1
men	1
were	1
lying	1
in	1
pools	1
of	1
blood,	1
singly	1
or	1
in	1
heaps.	1
Neither	1
Napoleon	1
nor	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
generals	1
had	1
ever	1
before	1
seen	1
such	1
horrors	1
or	1
so	1
many	1
slain	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
small	1
area.	1
The	1
roar	1
of	1
guns,	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
ceased	1
for	1
ten	1
hours,	1
wearied	1
the	1
ear	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
peculiar	1
significance	1
to	1
the	1
spectacle,	1
as	1
music	1
does	1
to	1
tableaux	1
vivants.	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
up	1
the	1
high	1
ground	1
at	1
Semenovsk,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
smoke	1
saw	1
ranks	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
uniforms	1
of	1
a	1
color	1
unfamiliar	1
to	1
him.	1
They	1
were	1
Russians.	1
	1
The	1
Russians	1
stood	1
in	1
serried	1
ranks	1
behind	1
Semenovsk	1
village	1
and	1
its	1
knoll,	1
and	1
their	1
guns	1
boomed	1
incessantly	1
along	1
their	1
line	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
clouds	1
of	1
smoke.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
battle:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
continuous	1
slaughter	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
avail	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
or	1
the	1
Russians.	1
Napoleon	1
stopped	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
again	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
reverie	1
from	1
which	1
Berthier	1
had	1
aroused	1
him.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
stop	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
directed	1
by	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
from	1
its	1
lack	1
of	1
success	1
this	1
affair,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
horrible.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
ventured	1
to	1
offer	1
to	1
lead	1
the	1
Old	1
Guard	1
into	1
action.	1
Ney	1
and	1
Berthier,	1
standing	1
near	1
Napoleon,	1
exchanged	1
looks	1
and	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
at	1
this	1
general's	1
senseless	1
offer.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
remained	1
silent	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
"At	1
eight	1
hundred	1
leagues	1
from	1
France,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
my	1
Guard	1
destroyed!"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
horse	1
rode	1
back	1
to	1
Shevardino.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXV	1
	1
On	1
the	1
rug-covered	1
bench	1
where	1
Pierre	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
sat	1
Kutuzov,	1
his	1
gray	1
head	1
hanging,	1
his	1
heavy	1
body	1
relaxed.	1
He	1
gave	1
no	1
orders,	1
but	1
only	1
assented	1
to	1
or	1
dissented	1
from	1
what	1
others	1
suggested.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
do	1
that,"	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
various	1
proposals.	1
"Yes,	1
yes:	1
go,	1
dear	1
boy,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
look,"	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
one	1
or	1
another	1
of	1
those	1
about	1
him;	1
or,	1
"No,	1
don't,	1
we'd	1
better	1
wait!"	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
reports	1
that	1
were	1
brought	1
him	1
and	1
gave	1
directions	1
when	1
his	1
subordinates	1
demanded	1
that	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
when	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
reports	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
import	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
spoken,	1
but	1
rather	1
in	1
something	1
else--in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
face	1
and	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
reporting.	1
By	1
long	1
years	1
of	1
military	1
experience	1
he	1
knew,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
age	1
understood,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
one	1
man	1
to	1
direct	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
others	1
struggling	1
with	1
death,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
is	1
decided	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
orders	1
of	1
a	1
commander-in-chief,	1
nor	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
troops	1
are	1
stationed,	1
nor	1
by	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
cannon	1
or	1
of	1
slaughtered	1
men,	1
but	1
by	1
that	1
intangible	1
force	1
called	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
he	1
watched	1
this	1
force	1
and	1
guided	1
it	1
in	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
general	1
expression	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
concentrated	1
quiet	1
attention,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
strained	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
master	1
the	1
fatigue	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
and	1
feeble	1
body.	1
	1
At	1
eleven	1
o'clock	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
fleches	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
been	1
retaken,	1
but	1
that	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
was	1
wounded.	1
Kutuzov	1
groaned	1
and	1
swayed	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Ride	1
over	1
to	1
Prince	1
Peter	1
Ivanovich	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
about	1
it	1
exactly,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
adjutants,	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Wurttemberg	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
"Will	1
Your	1
Highness	1
please	1
take	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
army?"	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
the	1
duke's	1
departure--before	1
he	1
could	1
possibly	1
have	1
reached	1
Semenovsk--his	1
adjutant	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
told	1
Kutuzov	1
that	1
the	1
duke	1
asked	1
for	1
more	1
troops.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
made	1
a	1
grimace	1
and	1
sent	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
Dokhturov	1
to	1
take	1
over	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
army,	1
and	1
a	1
request	1
to	1
the	1
duke--whom	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
spare	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
important	1
moment--to	1
return	1
to	1
him.	1
When	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
news	1
that	1
Murat	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner,	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
officers	1
congratulated	1
him,	1
Kutuzov	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
little,	1
gentlemen,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"The	1
battle	1
is	1
won,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
Murat.	1
Still,	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
wait	1
before	1
we	1
rejoice."	1
	1
But	1
he	1
sent	1
an	1
adjutant	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
news	1
round	1
the	1
army.	1
	1
When	1
Scherbinin	1
came	1
galloping	1
from	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
with	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
captured	1
the	1
fleches	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Semenovsk,	1
Kutuzov,	1
guessing	1
by	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
by	1
Scherbinin's	1
looks	1
that	1
the	1
news	1
was	1
bad,	1
rose	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
stretch	1
his	1
legs	1
and,	1
taking	1
Scherbinin's	1
arm,	1
led	1
him	1
aside.	1
	1
"Go,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Ermolov,	1
"and	1
see	1
whether	1
something	1
can't	1
be	1
done."	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
in	1
Gorki,	1
near	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
position.	1
The	1
attack	1
directed	1
by	1
Napoleon	1
against	1
our	1
left	1
flank	1
had	1
been	1
several	1
times	1
repulsed.	1
In	1
the	1
center	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
beyond	1
Borodino,	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
left	1
flank	1
Uvarov's	1
cavalry	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
flight.	1
	1
Toward	1
three	1
o'clock	1
the	1
French	1
attacks	1
ceased.	1
On	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
around	1
him,	1
Kutuzov	1
noticed	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
extreme	1
tension.	1
He	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
day's	1
success--a	1
success	1
exceeding	1
his	1
expectations,	1
but	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
strength	1
was	1
failing	1
him.	1
Several	1
times	1
his	1
head	1
dropped	1
low	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
falling	1
and	1
he	1
dozed	1
off.	1
Dinner	1
was	1
brought	1
him.	1
	1
Adjutant	1
General	1
Wolzogen,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
when	1
riding	1
past	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
said,	1
"the	1
war	1
should	1
be	1
extended	1
widely,"	1
and	1
whom	1
Bagration	1
so	1
detested,	1
rode	1
up	1
while	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
at	1
dinner.	1
Wolzogen	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly	1
to	1
report	1
on	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
affairs	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank.	1
The	1
sagacious	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly,	1
seeing	1
crowds	1
of	1
wounded	1
men	1
running	1
back	1
and	1
the	1
disordered	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
weighed	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
favorite	1
officer	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
with	1
that	1
news.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
chewing	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
roast	1
chicken	1
with	1
difficulty	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
Wolzogen	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
brightened	1
under	1
their	1
puckering	1
lids.	1
	1
Wolzogen,	1
nonchalantly	1
stretching	1
his	1
legs,	1
approached	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
a	1
half-contemptuous	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips,	1
scarcely	1
touching	1
the	1
peak	1
of	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
He	1
treated	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
with	1
a	1
somewhat	1
affected	1
nonchalance	1
intended	1
to	1
show	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
highly	1
trained	1
military	1
man,	1
he	1
left	1
it	1
to	1
Russians	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
idol	1
of	1
this	1
useless	1
old	1
man,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
dealing	1
with.	1
"Der	1
alte	1
Herr"	1
(as	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
set	1
the	1
Germans	1
called	1
Kutuzov)	1
"is	1
making	1
himself	1
very	1
comfortable,"	1
thought	1
Wolzogen,	1
and	1
looking	1
severely	1
at	1
the	1
dishes	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Kutuzov	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
report	1
to	1
"the	1
old	1
gentleman"	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
affairs	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
as	1
Barclay	1
had	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
understood	1
it.	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
our	1
position	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
enemy's	1
hands	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
dislodge	1
them	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
troops,	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
running	1
away	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
stop	1
them,"	1
he	1
reported.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
ceased	1
chewing	1
and	1
fixed	1
an	1
astonished	1
gaze	1
on	1
Wolzogen,	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
understanding	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him.	1
Wolzogen,	1
noticing	1
"the	1
old	1
gentleman's"	1
agitation,	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile:	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
considered	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
conceal	1
from	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
seen.	1
The	1
troops	1
are	1
in	1
complete	1
disorder..."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
seen?	1
You	1
have	1
seen?..."	1
Kutuzov	1
shouted.	1
Frowning	1
and	1
rising	1
quickly,	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Wolzogen.	1
	1
"How...	1
how	1
dare	1
you!..."	1
he	1
shouted,	1
choking	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
threatening	1
gesture	1
with	1
his	1
trembling	1
arms:	1
"How	1
dare	1
you,	1
sir,	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
me?	1
You	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it.	1
Tell	1
General	1
Barclay	1
from	1
me	1
that	1
his	1
information	1
is	1
incorrect	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
real	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
is	1
better	1
known	1
to	1
me,	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
than	1
to	1
him."	1
	1
Wolzogen	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
rejoinder,	1
but	1
Kutuzov	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
enemy	1
has	1
been	1
repulsed	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
and	1
defeated	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
flank.	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
amiss,	1
sir,	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
yourself	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
don't	1
know!	1
Be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
ride	1
to	1
General	1
Barclay	1
and	1
inform	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
firm	1
intention	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
enemy	1
tomorrow,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
sternly.	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
sound	1
audible	1
was	1
the	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
of	1
the	1
panting	1
old	1
general.	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
repulsed	1
everywhere,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
brave	1
army!	1
The	1
enemy	1
is	1
beaten,	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
shall	1
drive	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
sacred	1
soil	1
of	1
Russia,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
crossing	1
himself,	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
sobbed	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
Wolzogen,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
curling	1
his	1
lips,	1
stepped	1
silently	1
aside,	1
marveling	1
at	1
"the	1
old	1
gentleman's"	1
conceited	1
stupidity.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
here	1
he	1
is,	1
my	1
hero!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
a	1
portly,	1
handsome,	1
dark-	1
haired	1
general	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
ascending	1
the	1
knoll.	1
	1
This	1
was	1
Raevski,	1
who	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
	1
Raevski	1
reported	1
that	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
firmly	1
holding	1
their	1
ground	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
no	1
longer	1
ventured	1
to	1
attack.	1
	1
After	1
hearing	1
him,	1
Kutuzov	1
said	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
think,	1
like	1
some	1
others,	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
retreat?"	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
your	1
Highness,	1
in	1
indecisive	1
actions	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
most	1
stubborn	1
who	1
remain	1
victors,"	1
replied	1
Raevski,	1
"and	1
in	1
my	1
opinion..."	1
	1
"Kaysarov!"	1
Kutuzov	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
adjutant.	1
"Sit	1
down	1
and	1
write	1
out	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
for	1
tomorrow.	1
And	1
you,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
addressing	1
another,	1
"ride	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
announce	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
attack."	1
	1
While	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Raevski	1
and	1
dictating	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
Wolzogen	1
returned	1
from	1
Barclay	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
General	1
Barclay	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
written	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
had	1
given.	1
	1
Kutuzov,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Wolzogen,	1
gave	1
directions	1
for	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
out	1
which	1
the	1
former	1
commander-in-chief,	1
to	1
avoid	1
personal	1
responsibility,	1
very	1
judiciously	1
wished	1
to	1
receive.	1
	1
And	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
that	1
mysterious	1
indefinable	1
bond	1
which	1
maintains	1
throughout	1
an	1
army	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
temper,	1
known	1
as	1
"the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
army,"	1
and	1
which	1
constitutes	1
the	1
sinew	1
of	1
war,	1
Kutuzov's	1
words,	1
his	1
order	1
for	1
a	1
battle	1
next	1
day,	1
immediately	1
became	1
known	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
or	1
the	1
same	1
order	1
that	1
reached	1
the	1
farthest	1
links	1
of	1
that	1
chain.	1
The	1
tales	1
passing	1
from	1
mouth	1
to	1
mouth	1
at	1
different	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
resemble	1
what	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
said,	1
but	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
spread	1
everywhere	1
because	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
cunning	1
calculations,	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
soul	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
every	1
Russian.	1
	1
And	1
on	1
learning	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
hearing	1
from	1
the	1
highest	1
quarters	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
believe,	1
the	1
exhausted,	1
wavering	1
men	1
felt	1
comforted	1
and	1
inspirited.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXVI	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
regiment	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
reserves	1
which	1
till	1
after	1
one	1
o'clock	1
were	1
stationed	1
inactive	1
behind	1
Semenovsk,	1
under	1
heavy	1
artillery	1
fire.	1
Toward	1
two	1
o'clock	1
the	1
regiment,	1
having	1
already	1
lost	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
men,	1
was	1
moved	1
forward	1
into	1
a	1
trampled	1
oatfield	1
in	1
the	1
gap	1
between	1
Semenovsk	1
and	1
the	1
Knoll	1
Battery,	1
where	1
thousands	1
of	1
men	1
perished	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
an	1
intense,	1
concentrated	1
fire	1
from	1
several	1
hundred	1
enemy	1
guns	1
was	1
directed	1
between	1
one	1
and	1
two	1
o'clock.	1
	1
Without	1
moving	1
from	1
that	1
spot	1
or	1
firing	1
a	1
single	1
shot	1
the	1
regiment	1
here	1
lost	1
another	1
third	1
of	1
its	1
men.	1
From	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
especially	1
from	1
the	1
right,	1
in	1
the	1
unlifting	1
smoke	1
the	1
guns	1
boomed,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mysterious	1
domain	1
of	1
smoke	1
that	1
overlay	1
the	1
whole	1
space	1
in	1
front,	1
quick	1
hissing	1
cannon	1
balls	1
and	1
slow	1
whistling	1
shells	1
flew	1
unceasingly.	1
At	1
times,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
allow	1
them	1
a	1
respite,	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
passed	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
cannon	1
balls	1
and	1
shells	1
all	1
flew	1
overhead,	1
but	1
sometimes	1
several	1
men	1
were	1
torn	1
from	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
and	1
the	1
slain	1
were	1
continually	1
being	1
dragged	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
wounded	1
carried	1
off.	1
	1
With	1
each	1
fresh	1
blow	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
chance	1
of	1
life	1
remained	1
for	1
those	1
not	1
yet	1
killed.	1
The	1
regiment	1
stood	1
in	1
columns	1
of	1
battalion,	1
three	1
hundred	1
paces	1
apart,	1
but	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
always	1
in	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
mood.	1
All	1
alike	1
were	1
taciturn	1
and	1
morose.	1
Talk	1
was	1
rarely	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
ranks,	1
and	1
it	1
ceased	1
altogether	1
every	1
time	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
a	1
successful	1
shot	1
and	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
"stretchers!"	1
was	1
heard.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
time,	1
by	1
their	1
officers'	1
order,	1
the	1
men	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
One,	1
having	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
shako,	1
carefully	1
loosened	1
the	1
gathers	1
of	1
its	1
lining	1
and	1
drew	1
them	1
tight	1
again;	1
another,	1
rubbing	1
some	1
dry	1
clay	1
between	1
his	1
palms,	1
polished	1
his	1
bayonet;	1
another	1
fingered	1
the	1
strap	1
and	1
pulled	1
the	1
buckle	1
of	1
his	1
bandolier,	1
while	1
another	1
smoothed	1
and	1
refolded	1
his	1
leg	1
bands	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
boots	1
on	1
again.	1
Some	1
built	1
little	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
tufts	1
in	1
the	1
plowed	1
ground,	1
or	1
plaited	1
baskets	1
from	1
the	1
straw	1
in	1
the	1
cornfield.	1
All	1
seemed	1
fully	1
absorbed	1
in	1
these	1
pursuits.	1
When	1
men	1
were	1
killed	1
or	1
wounded,	1
when	1
rows	1
of	1
stretchers	1
went	1
past,	1
when	1
some	1
troops	1
retreated,	1
and	1
when	1
great	1
masses	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
came	1
into	1
view	1
through	1
the	1
smoke,	1
no	1
one	1
paid	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
these	1
things.	1
But	1
when	1
our	1
artillery	1
or	1
cavalry	1
advanced	1
or	1
some	1
of	1
our	1
infantry	1
were	1
seen	1
to	1
move	1
forward,	1
words	1
of	1
approval	1
were	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
But	1
the	1
liveliest	1
attention	1
was	1
attracted	1
by	1
occurrences	1
quite	1
apart	1
from,	1
and	1
unconnected	1
with,	1
the	1
battle.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
these	1
morally	1
exhausted	1
men	1
found	1
relief	1
in	1
everyday,	1
commonplace	1
occurrences.	1
A	1
battery	1
of	1
artillery	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
regiment.	1
The	1
horse	1
of	1
an	1
ammunition	1
cart	1
put	1
its	1
leg	1
over	1
a	1
trace.	1
"Hey,	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
trace	1
horse!...	1
Get	1
her	1
leg	1
out!	1
She'll	1
fall....	1
Ah,	1
they	1
don't	1
see	1
it!"	1
came	1
identical	1
shouts	1
from	1
the	1
ranks	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
regiment.	1
Another	1
time,	1
general	1
attention	1
was	1
attracted	1
by	1
a	1
small	1
brown	1
dog,	1
coming	1
heaven	1
knows	1
whence,	1
which	1
trotted	1
in	1
a	1
preoccupied	1
manner	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
ranks	1
with	1
tail	1
stiffly	1
erect	1
till	1
suddenly	1
a	1
shell	1
fell	1
close	1
by,	1
when	1
it	1
yelped,	1
tucked	1
its	1
tail	1
between	1
its	1
legs,	1
and	1
darted	1
aside.	1
Yells	1
and	1
shrieks	1
of	1
laughter	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment.	1
But	1
such	1
distractions	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
for	1
eight	1
hours	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
been	1
inactive,	1
without	1
food,	1
in	1
constant	1
fear	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
their	1
pale	1
and	1
gloomy	1
faces	1
grew	1
ever	1
paler	1
and	1
gloomier.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
pale	1
and	1
gloomy	1
like	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
one	1
patch	1
to	1
another,	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
beside	1
an	1
oatfield,	1
with	1
head	1
bowed	1
and	1
arms	1
behind	1
his	1
back.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
no	1
orders	1
to	1
be	1
given.	1
Everything	1
went	1
on	1
of	1
itself.	1
The	1
killed	1
were	1
dragged	1
from	1
the	1
front,	1
the	1
wounded	1
carried	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
ranks	1
closed	1
up.	1
If	1
any	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
rear	1
they	1
returned	1
immediately	1
and	1
hastily.	1
At	1
first	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
considering	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
rouse	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
an	1
example,	1
walked	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
ranks,	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
became	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
he	1
could	1
teach	1
them.	1
All	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
as	1
of	1
every	1
soldier	1
there,	1
were	1
unconsciously	1
bent	1
on	1
avoiding	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
their	1
situation.	1
He	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
meadow,	1
dragging	1
his	1
feet,	1
rustling	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
dust	1
that	1
covered	1
his	1
boots;	1
now	1
he	1
took	1
big	1
strides	1
trying	1
to	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
footprints	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
meadow	1
by	1
the	1
mowers,	1
then	1
he	1
counted	1
his	1
steps,	1
calculating	1
how	1
often	1
he	1
must	1
walk	1
from	1
one	1
strip	1
to	1
another	1
to	1
walk	1
a	1
mile,	1
then	1
he	1
stripped	1
the	1
flowers	1
from	1
the	1
wormwood	1
that	1
grew	1
along	1
a	1
boundary	1
rut,	1
rubbed	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
palms,	1
and	1
smelled	1
their	1
pungent,	1
sweetly	1
bitter	1
scent.	1
Nothing	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
day's	1
thoughts.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing.	1
He	1
listened	1
with	1
weary	1
ears	1
to	1
the	1
ever-recurring	1
sounds,	1
distinguishing	1
the	1
whistle	1
of	1
flying	1
projectiles	1
from	1
the	1
booming	1
of	1
the	1
reports,	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
tiresomely	1
familiar	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
battalion,	1
and	1
waited.	1
"Here	1
it	1
comes...	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
coming	1
our	1
way	1
again!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
listening	1
to	1
an	1
approaching	1
whistle	1
in	1
the	1
hidden	1
region	1
of	1
smoke.	1
"One,	1
another!	1
Again!	1
It	1
has	1
hit...."	1
He	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
ranks.	1
"No,	1
it	1
has	1
gone	1
over.	1
But	1
this	1
one	1
has	1
hit!"	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
started	1
trying	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
boundary	1
strip	1
in	1
sixteen	1
paces.	1
A	1
whizz	1
and	1
a	1
thud!	1
Five	1
paces	1
from	1
him,	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
tore	1
up	1
the	1
dry	1
earth	1
and	1
disappeared.	1
A	1
chill	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
back.	1
Again	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
ranks.	1
Probably	1
many	1
had	1
been	1
hit--a	1
large	1
crowd	1
had	1
gathered	1
near	1
the	1
second	1
battalion.	1
	1
"Adjutant!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
"Order	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
crowd	1
together."	1
	1
The	1
adjutant,	1
having	1
obeyed	1
this	1
instruction,	1
approached	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
From	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
a	1
battalion	1
commander	1
rode	1
up.	1
	1
"Look	1
out!"	1
came	1
a	1
frightened	1
cry	1
from	1
a	1
soldier	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
whirring	1
in	1
rapid	1
flight	1
and	1
alighting	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
a	1
shell	1
dropped	1
with	1
little	1
noise	1
within	1
two	1
steps	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
battalion	1
commander's	1
horse.	1
The	1
horse	1
first,	1
regardless	1
of	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
to	1
show	1
fear,	1
snorted,	1
reared	1
almost	1
throwing	1
the	1
major,	1
and	1
galloped	1
aside.	1
The	1
horse's	1
terror	1
infected	1
the	1
men.	1
	1
"Lie	1
down!"	1
cried	1
the	1
adjutant,	1
throwing	1
himself	1
flat	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
hesitated.	1
The	1
smoking	1
shell	1
spun	1
like	1
a	1
top	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
prostrate	1
adjutant,	1
near	1
a	1
wormwood	1
plant	1
between	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
the	1
meadow.	1
	1
"Can	1
this	1
be	1
death?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
looking	1
with	1
a	1
quite	1
new,	1
envious	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
grass,	1
the	1
wormwood,	1
and	1
the	1
streamlet	1
of	1
smoke	1
that	1
curled	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
rotating	1
black	1
ball.	1
"I	1
cannot,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
die.	1
I	1
love	1
life--I	1
love	1
this	1
grass,	1
this	1
earth,	1
this	1
air...."	1
He	1
thought	1
this,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
remembered	1
that	1
people	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"It's	1
shameful,	1
sir!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"What..."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
speaking.	1
At	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
an	1
explosion,	1
a	1
whistle	1
of	1
splinters	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
breaking	1
window	1
frame,	1
a	1
suffocating	1
smell	1
of	1
powder,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
started	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
raising	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
chest.	1
Several	1
officers	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
From	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
abdomen,	1
blood	1
was	1
welling	1
out	1
making	1
a	1
large	1
stain	1
on	1
the	1
grass.	1
	1
The	1
militiamen	1
with	1
stretchers	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
up	1
stood	1
behind	1
the	1
officers.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
grass,	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
and	1
noisily.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
waiting	1
for?	1
Come	1
along!"	1
	1
The	1
peasants	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
legs,	1
but	1
he	1
moaned	1
piteously	1
and,	1
exchanging	1
looks,	1
they	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
again.	1
	1
"Pick	1
him	1
up,	1
lift	1
him,	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same!"	1
cried	1
someone.	1
	1
They	1
again	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
stretcher.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
God!	1
My	1
God!	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
The	1
stomach?	1
That	1
means	1
death!	1
My	1
God!"--	1
voices	1
among	1
the	1
officers	1
were	1
heard	1
saying.	1
	1
"It	1
flew	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth	1
past	1
my	1
ear,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
The	1
peasants,	1
adjusting	1
the	1
stretcher	1
to	1
their	1
shoulders,	1
started	1
hurriedly	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
they	1
had	1
trodden	1
down,	1
to	1
the	1
dressing	1
station.	1
	1
"Keep	1
in	1
step!	1
Ah...	1
those	1
peasants!"	1
shouted	1
an	1
officer,	1
seizing	1
by	1
their	1
shoulders	1
and	1
checking	1
the	1
peasants,	1
who	1
were	1
walking	1
unevenly	1
and	1
jolting	1
the	1
stretcher.	1
	1
"Get	1
into	1
step,	1
Fedor...	1
I	1
say,	1
Fedor!"	1
said	1
the	1
foremost	1
peasant.	1
	1
"Now	1
that's	1
right!"	1
said	1
the	1
one	1
behind	1
joyfully,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
step.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency!	1
Eh,	1
Prince!"	1
said	1
the	1
trembling	1
voice	1
of	1
Timokhin,	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
up	1
and	1
was	1
looking	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
stretcher.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
speaker	1
from	1
the	1
stretcher	1
into	1
which	1
his	1
head	1
had	1
sunk	1
deep	1
and	1
again	1
his	1
eyelids	1
drooped.	1
	1
The	1
militiamen	1
carried	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
the	1
dressing	1
station	1
by	1
the	1
wood,	1
where	1
wagons	1
were	1
stationed.	1
The	1
dressing	1
station	1
consisted	1
of	1
three	1
tents	1
with	1
flaps	1
turned	1
back,	1
pitched	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
birch	1
wood.	1
In	1
the	1
wood,	1
wagons	1
and	1
horses	1
were	1
standing.	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
eating	1
oats	1
from	1
their	1
movable	1
troughs	1
and	1
sparrows	1
flew	1
down	1
and	1
pecked	1
the	1
grains	1
that	1
fell.	1
Some	1
crows,	1
scenting	1
blood,	1
flew	1
among	1
the	1
birch	1
trees	1
cawing	1
impatiently.	1
Around	1
the	1
tents,	1
over	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
acres,	1
bloodstained	1
men	1
in	1
various	1
garbs	1
stood,	1
sat,	1
or	1
lay.	1
Around	1
the	1
wounded	1
stood	1
crowds	1
of	1
soldier	1
stretcher-bearers	1
with	1
dismal	1
and	1
attentive	1
faces,	1
whom	1
the	1
officers	1
keeping	1
order	1
tried	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
drive	1
from	1
the	1
spot.	1
Disregarding	1
the	1
officers'	1
orders,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
stood	1
leaning	1
against	1
their	1
stretchers	1
and	1
gazing	1
intently,	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
comprehend	1
the	1
difficult	1
problem	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
before	1
them.	1
From	1
the	1
tents	1
came	1
now	1
loud	1
angry	1
cries	1
and	1
now	1
plaintive	1
groans.	1
Occasionally	1
dressers	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
fetch	1
water,	1
or	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
in	1
next.	1
The	1
wounded	1
men	1
awaiting	1
their	1
turn	1
outside	1
the	1
tents	1
groaned,	1
sighed,	1
wept,	1
screamed,	1
swore,	1
or	1
asked	1
for	1
vodka.	1
Some	1
were	1
delirious.	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
bearers,	1
stepping	1
over	1
the	1
wounded	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
bandaged,	1
took	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tents	1
and	1
there	1
stopped,	1
awaiting	1
instructions.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
him.	1
He	1
remembered	1
the	1
meadow,	1
the	1
wormwood,	1
the	1
field,	1
the	1
whirling	1
black	1
ball,	1
and	1
his	1
sudden	1
rush	1
of	1
passionate	1
love	1
of	1
life.	1
Two	1
steps	1
from	1
him,	1
leaning	1
against	1
a	1
branch	1
and	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
attracting	1
general	1
attention,	1
stood	1
a	1
tall,	1
handsome,	1
black-haired	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bandaged	1
head.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
leg	1
by	1
bullets.	1
Around	1
him,	1
eagerly	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
talk,	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
wounded	1
and	1
stretcher-bearers	1
was	1
gathered.	1
	1
"We	1
kicked	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
there	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
chucked	1
everything,	1
we	1
grabbed	1
the	1
King	1
himself!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
looking	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
glittered	1
with	1
fever.	1
"If	1
only	1
reserves	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
just	1
then,	1
lads,	1
there	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
been	1
nothing	1
left	1
of	1
him!	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
surely..."	1
	1
Like	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
near	1
the	1
speaker,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes	1
and	1
experienced	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
comfort.	1
"But	1
isn't	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
now?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"And	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
there,	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
there	1
been	1
here?	1
Why	1
was	1
I	1
so	1
reluctant	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
life?	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
understand."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXXVII	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
doctors	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
in	1
a	1
bloodstained	1
apron,	1
holding	1
a	1
cigar	1
between	1
the	1
thumb	1
and	1
little	1
finger	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
small	1
bloodstained	1
hands,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
smear	1
it.	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
him,	1
but	1
above	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
men.	1
He	1
evidently	1
wanted	1
a	1
little	1
respite.	1
After	1
turning	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
he	1
sighed	1
and	1
looked	1
down.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
immediately,"	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
a	1
dresser	1
who	1
pointed	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
Murmurs	1
arose	1
among	1
the	1
wounded	1
who	1
were	1
waiting.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
world	1
only	1
the	1
gentry	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
chance!"	1
remarked	1
one.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
carried	1
in	1
and	1
laid	1
on	1
a	1
table	1
that	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
been	1
cleared	1
and	1
which	1
a	1
dresser	1
was	1
washing	1
down.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
distinctly	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
tent.	1
The	1
pitiful	1
groans	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
the	1
torturing	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
thigh,	1
stomach,	1
and	1
back	1
distracted	1
him.	1
All	1
he	1
saw	1
about	1
him	1
merged	1
into	1
a	1
general	1
impression	1
of	1
naked,	1
bleeding	1
human	1
bodies	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
low	1
tent,	1
as	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
previously,	1
on	1
that	1
hot	1
August	1
day,	1
such	1
bodies	1
had	1
filled	1
the	1
dirty	1
pond	1
beside	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road.	1
Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
flesh,	1
the	1
same	1
chair	1
a	1
canon,	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
even	1
then	1
filled	1
him	1
with	1
horror,	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
presentiment.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
three	1
operating	1
tables	1
in	1
the	1
tent.	1
Two	1
were	1
occupied,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
they	1
placed	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
For	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
witnessed	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
tables.	1
On	1
the	1
nearest	1
one	1
sat	1
a	1
Tartar,	1
probably	1
a	1
Cossack,	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
uniform	1
thrown	1
down	1
beside	1
him.	1
Four	1
soldiers	1
were	1
holding	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
spectacled	1
doctor	1
was	1
cutting	1
into	1
his	1
muscular	1
brown	1
back.	1
	1
"Ooh,	1
ooh,	1
ooh!"	1
grunted	1
the	1
Tartar,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
lifting	1
up	1
his	1
swarthy	1
snub-nosed	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
high	1
cheekbones,	1
and	1
baring	1
his	1
white	1
teeth,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
wriggle	1
and	1
twitch	1
his	1
body	1
and	1
utter	1
piercing,	1
ringing,	1
and	1
prolonged	1
yells.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
table,	1
round	1
which	1
many	1
people	1
were	1
crowding,	1
a	1
tall	1
well-fed	1
man	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
thrown	1
back.	1
His	1
curly	1
hair,	1
its	1
color,	1
and	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
seemed	1
strangely	1
familiar	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
Several	1
dressers	1
were	1
pressing	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
down.	1
One	1
large,	1
white,	1
plump	1
leg	1
twitched	1
rapidly	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
feverish	1
tremor.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
sobbing	1
and	1
choking	1
convulsively.	1
Two	1
doctors--one	1
of	1
whom	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
trembling--were	1
silently	1
doing	1
something	1
to	1
this	1
man's	1
other,	1
gory	1
leg.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
with	1
the	1
Tartar,	1
whom	1
they	1
covered	1
with	1
an	1
overcoat,	1
the	1
spectacled	1
doctor	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
wiping	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
and	1
quickly	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
"Undress	1
him!	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
waiting	1
for?"	1
he	1
cried	1
angrily	1
to	1
the	1
dressers.	1
	1
His	1
very	1
first,	1
remotest	1
recollections	1
of	1
childhood	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
mind	1
when	1
the	1
dresser	1
with	1
sleeves	1
rolled	1
up	1
began	1
hastily	1
to	1
undo	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
his	1
clothes	1
and	1
undressed	1
him.	1
The	1
doctor	1
bent	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
wound,	1
felt	1
it,	1
and	1
sighed	1
deeply.	1
Then	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
someone,	1
and	1
the	1
torturing	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
abdomen	1
caused	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
lose	1
consciousness.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
splintered	1
portions	1
of	1
his	1
thighbone	1
had	1
been	1
extracted,	1
the	1
torn	1
flesh	1
cut	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
wound	1
bandaged.	1
Water	1
was	1
being	1
sprinkled	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
the	1
doctor	1
bent	1
over,	1
kissed	1
him	1
silently	1
on	1
the	1
lips,	1
and	1
hurried	1
away.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
sufferings	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
enduring,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
enjoyed	1
a	1
blissful	1
feeling	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
experienced	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
All	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
happiest	1
moments	1
of	1
his	1
life--especially	1
his	1
earliest	1
childhood,	1
when	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
undressed	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
when	1
leaning	1
over	1
him	1
his	1
nurse	1
sang	1
him	1
to	1
sleep	1
and	1
he,	1
burying	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
pillow,	1
felt	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
mere	1
consciousness	1
of	1
life--returned	1
to	1
his	1
memory,	1
not	1
merely	1
as	1
something	1
past	1
but	1
as	1
something	1
present.	1
	1
The	1
doctors	1
were	1
busily	1
engaged	1
with	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
whose	1
head	1
seemed	1
familiar	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew:	1
they	1
were	1
lifting	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
quiet	1
him.	1
	1
"Show	1
it	1
to	1
me....	1
Oh,	1
ooh...	1
Oh!	1
Oh,	1
ooh!"	1
his	1
frightened	1
moans	1
could	1
be	1
heard,	1
subdued	1
by	1
suffering	1
and	1
broken	1
by	1
sobs.	1
	1
Hearing	1
those	1
moans	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
wanted	1
to	1
weep.	1
Whether	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
dying	1
without	1
glory,	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
life,	1
or	1
because	1
of	1
those	1
memories	1
of	1
a	1
childhood	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
return,	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
suffering	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
suffering	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
near	1
him	1
was	1
groaning	1
so	1
piteously--he	1
felt	1
like	1
weeping	1
childlike,	1
kindly,	1
and	1
almost	1
happy	1
tears.	1
	1
The	1
wounded	1
man	1
was	1
shown	1
his	1
amputated	1
leg	1
stained	1
with	1
clotted	1
blood	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
boot	1
still	1
on.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh,	1
ooh!"	1
he	1
sobbed,	1
like	1
a	1
woman.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
beside	1
him,	1
preventing	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
from	1
seeing	1
his	1
face,	1
moved	1
away.	1
	1
"My	1
God!	1
What	1
is	1
this?	1
Why	1
is	1
he	1
here?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
miserable,	1
sobbing,	1
enfeebled	1
man	1
whose	1
leg	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
amputated,	1
he	1
recognized	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin.	1
Men	1
were	1
supporting	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
offering	1
him	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
water,	1
but	1
his	1
trembling,	1
swollen	1
lips	1
could	1
not	1
grasp	1
its	1
rim.	1
Anatole	1
was	1
sobbing	1
painfully.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
he!	1
Yes,	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
somehow	1
closely	1
and	1
painfully	1
connected	1
with	1
me,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
not	1
yet	1
clearly	1
grasping	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
before	1
him.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
connection	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
with	1
my	1
childhood	1
and	1
life?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
without	1
finding	1
an	1
answer.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
a	1
new	1
unexpected	1
memory	1
from	1
that	1
realm	1
of	1
pure	1
and	1
loving	1
childhood	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
remembered	1
Natasha	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
1810,	1
with	1
her	1
slender	1
neck	1
and	1
arms	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
happy	1
face	1
ready	1
for	1
rapture,	1
and	1
love	1
and	1
tenderness	1
for	1
her,	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
vivid	1
than	1
ever,	1
awoke	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
now	1
remembered	1
the	1
connection	1
that	1
existed	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
dimly	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
through	1
tears	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
swollen	1
eyes.	1
He	1
remembered	1
everything,	1
and	1
ecstatic	1
pity	1
and	1
love	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
overflowed	1
his	1
happy	1
heart.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
restrain	1
himself	1
and	1
wept	1
tender	1
loving	1
tears	1
for	1
his	1
fellow	1
men,	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
their	1
errors.	1
	1
"Compassion,	1
love	1
of	1
our	1
brothers,	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
love	1
us	1
and	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
hate	1
us,	1
love	1
of	1
our	1
enemies;	1
yes,	1
that	1
love	1
which	1
God	1
preached	1
on	1
earth	1
and	1
which	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
taught	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
understand--that	1
is	1
what	1
made	1
me	1
sorry	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
life,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
remained	1
for	1
me	1
had	1
I	1
lived.	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late.	1
I	1
know	1
it!"	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXVIII	1
	1
The	1
terrible	1
spectacle	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield	1
covered	1
with	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
heaviness	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
some	1
twenty	1
generals	1
he	1
knew	1
personally	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
or	1
wounded,	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
impotence	1
of	1
his	1
once	1
mighty	1
arm,	1
produced	1
an	1
unexpected	1
impression	1
on	1
Napoleon	1
who	1
usually	1
liked	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded,	1
thereby,	1
he	1
considered,	1
testing	1
his	1
strength	1
of	1
mind.	1
This	1
day	1
the	1
horrible	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield	1
overcame	1
that	1
strength	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
constituted	1
his	1
merit	1
and	1
his	1
greatness.	1
He	1
rode	1
hurriedly	1
from	1
the	1
battlefield	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
knoll,	1
where	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
campstool,	1
his	1
sallow	1
face	1
swollen	1
and	1
heavy,	1
his	1
eyes	1
dim,	1
his	1
nose	1
red,	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
hoarse,	1
involuntarily	1
listening,	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes,	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing.	1
With	1
painful	1
dejection	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
action,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
regarded	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
participant	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
arrest.	1
A	1
personal,	1
human	1
feeling	1
for	1
a	1
brief	1
moment	1
got	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
the	1
artificial	1
phantasm	1
of	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
served	1
so	1
long.	1
He	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
person	1
the	1
sufferings	1
and	1
death	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
The	1
heaviness	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
chest	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
suffering	1
and	1
death	1
for	1
himself.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
desire	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
victory,	1
or	1
glory	1
(what	1
need	1
had	1
he	1
for	1
any	1
more	1
glory?).	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
wished	1
for	1
was	1
rest,	1
tranquillity,	1
and	1
freedom.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
Semenovsk	1
heights	1
the	1
artillery	1
commander	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
several	1
batteries	1
of	1
artillery	1
up	1
to	1
those	1
heights	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
crowded	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Knyazkovo.	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
assented	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
orders	1
that	1
news	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
those	1
batteries	1
produced.	1
	1
An	1
adjutant	1
came	1
now	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
guns	1
had	1
been	1
concentrated	1
on	1
the	1
Russians,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
ordered,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
still	1
held	1
their	1
ground.	1
	1
"Our	1
fire	1
is	1
mowing	1
them	1
down	1
by	1
rows,	1
but	1
still	1
they	1
hold	1
on,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"They	1
want	1
more!..."	1
said	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice.	1
	1
"Sire?"	1
asked	1
the	1
adjutant	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
the	1
remark.	1
	1
"They	1
want	1
more!"	1
croaked	1
Napoleon	1
frowning.	1
"Let	1
them	1
have	1
it!"	1
	1
Even	1
before	1
he	1
gave	1
that	1
order	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
desire,	1
and	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
order	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him,	1
was	1
being	1
done.	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
back	1
into	1
that	1
artificial	1
realm	1
of	1
imaginary	1
greatness,	1
and	1
again--as	1
a	1
horse	1
walking	1
a	1
treadmill	1
thinks	1
it	1
is	1
doing	1
something	1
for	1
itself--he	1
submissively	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
cruel,	1
sad,	1
gloomy,	1
and	1
inhuman	1
role	1
predestined	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
alone	1
were	1
the	1
mind	1
and	1
conscience	1
darkened	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
responsibility	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
lay	1
more	1
than	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
who	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
it.	1
Never	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
could	1
he	1
understand	1
goodness,	1
beauty,	1
or	1
truth,	1
or	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
actions	1
which	1
were	1
too	1
contrary	1
to	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth,	1
too	1
remote	1
from	1
everything	1
human,	1
for	1
him	1
ever	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
grasp	1
their	1
meaning.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
disavow	1
his	1
actions,	1
belauded	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
half	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
repudiate	1
truth,	1
goodness,	1
and	1
all	1
humanity.	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
over	1
the	1
battlefield	1
strewn	1
with	1
men	1
killed	1
and	1
maimed	1
(by	1
his	1
will	1
as	1
he	1
believed),	1
did	1
he	1
reckon	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
how	1
many	1
Russians	1
there	1
were	1
for	1
each	1
Frenchman	1
and,	1
deceiving	1
himself,	1
find	1
reason	1
for	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
calculation	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
five	1
Russians	1
for	1
every	1
Frenchman.	1
Not	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
alone	1
did	1
he	1
write	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Paris	1
that	1
"the	1
battle	1
field	1
was	1
superb,"	1
because	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
corpses	1
lay	1
there,	1
but	1
even	1
on	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
St.	1
Helena	1
in	1
the	1
peaceful	1
solitude	1
where	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
devote	1
his	1
leisure	1
to	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
deeds	1
he	1
had	1
done,	1
he	1
wrote:	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
war	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
popular	1
war	1
of	1
modern	1
times:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
war	1
of	1
good	1
sense,	1
for	1
real	1
interests,	1
for	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
security	1
of	1
all;	1
it	1
was	1
purely	1
pacific	1
and	1
conservative.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
war	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
cause,	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
uncertainties	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
security.	1
A	1
new	1
horizon	1
and	1
new	1
labors	1
were	1
opening	1
out,	1
full	1
of	1
well-being	1
and	1
prosperity	1
for	1
all.	1
The	1
European	1
system	1
was	1
already	1
founded;	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
was	1
to	1
organize	1
it.	1
	1
Satisfied	1
on	1
these	1
great	1
points	1
and	1
with	1
tranquility	1
everywhere,	1
I	1
too	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
my	1
Congress	1
and	1
my	1
Holy	1
Alliance.	1
Those	1
ideas	1
were	1
stolen	1
from	1
me.	1
In	1
that	1
reunion	1
of	1
great	1
sovereigns	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
discussed	1
our	1
interests	1
like	1
one	1
family,	1
and	1
have	1
rendered	1
account	1
to	1
the	1
peoples	1
as	1
clerk	1
to	1
master.	1
	1
Europe	1
would	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
soon	1
have	1
been,	1
in	1
fact,	1
but	1
one	1
people,	1
and	1
anyone	1
who	1
traveled	1
anywhere	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
himself	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
fatherland.	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
demanded	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
all	1
navigable	1
rivers	1
for	1
everybody,	1
that	1
the	1
seas	1
should	1
be	1
common	1
to	1
all,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
standing	1
armies	1
should	1
be	1
reduced	1
henceforth	1
to	1
mere	1
guards	1
for	1
the	1
sovereigns.	1
	1
On	1
returning	1
to	1
France,	1
to	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
great,	1
strong,	1
magnificent,	1
peaceful,	1
and	1
glorious	1
fatherland,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
proclaimed	1
her	1
frontiers	1
immutable;	1
all	1
future	1
wars	1
purely	1
defensive,	1
all	1
aggrandizement	1
antinational.	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
associated	1
my	1
son	1
in	1
the	1
Empire;	1
my	1
dictatorship	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
finished,	1
and	1
his	1
constitutional	1
reign	1
would	1
have	1
begun.	1
	1
Paris	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
capital	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
the	1
envy	1
of	1
the	1
nations!	1
	1
My	1
leisure	1
then,	1
and	1
my	1
old	1
age,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
devoted,	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
Empress	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
royal	1
apprenticeship	1
of	1
my	1
son,	1
to	1
leisurely	1
visiting,	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
horses	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
true	1
country	1
couple,	1
every	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
Empire,	1
receiving	1
complaints,	1
redressing	1
wrongs,	1
and	1
scattering	1
public	1
buildings	1
and	1
benefactions	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
everywhere.	1
	1
Napoleon,	1
predestined	1
by	1
Providence	1
for	1
the	1
gloomy	1
role	1
of	1
executioner	1
of	1
the	1
peoples,	1
assured	1
himself	1
that	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
his	1
actions	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
peoples'	1
welfare	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
control	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
millions	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
power	1
confer	1
benefactions.	1
	1
"Of	1
four	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
who	1
crossed	1
the	1
Vistula,"	1
he	1
wrote	1
further	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
war,	1
"half	1
were	1
Austrians,	1
Prussians,	1
Saxons,	1
Poles,	1
Bavarians,	1
Wurttembergers,	1
Mecklenburgers,	1
Spaniards,	1
Italians,	1
and	1
Neapolitans.	1
The	1
Imperial	1
army,	1
strictly	1
speaking,	1
was	1
one	1
third	1
composed	1
of	1
Dutch,	1
Belgians,	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine,	1
Piedmontese,	1
Swiss,	1
Genevese,	1
Tuscans,	1
Romans,	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
Thirty-second	1
Military	1
Division,	1
of	1
Bremen,	1
of	1
Hamburg,	1
and	1
so	1
on:	1
it	1
included	1
scarcely	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
thousand	1
who	1
spoke	1
French.	1
The	1
Russian	1
expedition	1
actually	1
cost	1
France	1
less	1
than	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
men;	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
in	1
its	1
retreat	1
from	1
Vilna	1
to	1
Moscow	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
various	1
battles	1
four	1
times	1
more	1
men	1
than	1
the	1
French	1
army;	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
cost	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
Russians	1
who	1
died	1
of	1
cold	1
and	1
want	1
in	1
the	1
woods;	1
finally,	1
in	1
its	1
march	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
Oder	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
also	1
suffered	1
from	1
the	1
severity	1
of	1
the	1
season;	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
reached	1
Vilna	1
it	1
numbered	1
only	1
fifty	1
thousand,	1
and	1
at	1
Kalisch	1
less	1
than	1
eighteen	1
thousand."	1
	1
He	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Russia	1
came	1
about	1
by	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
the	1
horrors	1
that	1
occurred	1
did	1
not	1
stagger	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
boldly	1
took	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
for	1
what	1
happened,	1
and	1
his	1
darkened	1
mind	1
found	1
justification	1
in	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
among	1
the	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
who	1
perished	1
there	1
were	1
fewer	1
Frenchmen	1
than	1
Hessians	1
and	1
Bavarians.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXIX	1
	1
Several	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
the	1
slain	1
lay	1
in	1
diverse	1
postures	1
and	1
various	1
uniforms	1
on	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
meadows	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
Davydov	1
family	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
crown	1
serfs--those	1
fields	1
and	1
meadows	1
where	1
for	1
hundreds	1
of	1
years	1
the	1
peasants	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
Gorki,	1
Shevardino,	1
and	1
Semenovsk	1
had	1
reaped	1
their	1
harvests	1
and	1
pastured	1
their	1
cattle.	1
At	1
the	1
dressing	1
stations	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
earth	1
were	1
soaked	1
with	1
blood	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
of	1
some	1
three	1
acres	1
around.	1
Crowds	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
various	1
arms,	1
wounded	1
and	1
unwounded,	1
with	1
frightened	1
faces,	1
dragged	1
themselves	1
back	1
to	1
Mozhaysk	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
army	1
and	1
back	1
to	1
Valuevo	1
from	1
the	1
other.	1
Other	1
crowds,	1
exhausted	1
and	1
hungry,	1
went	1
forward	1
led	1
by	1
their	1
officers.	1
Others	1
held	1
their	1
ground	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
fire.	1
	1
Over	1
the	1
whole	1
field,	1
previously	1
so	1
gaily	1
beautiful	1
with	1
the	1
glitter	1
of	1
bayonets	1
and	1
cloudlets	1
of	1
smoke	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
sun,	1
there	1
now	1
spread	1
a	1
mist	1
of	1
damp	1
and	1
smoke	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
acid	1
smell	1
of	1
saltpeter	1
and	1
blood.	1
Clouds	1
gathered	1
and	1
drops	1
of	1
rain	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded,	1
on	1
the	1
frightened,	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
hesitating	1
men,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say:	1
"Enough,	1
men!	1
Enough!	1
Cease...	1
bethink	1
yourselves!	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
doing?"	1
	1
To	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
both	1
sides	1
alike,	1
worn	1
out	1
by	1
want	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
rest,	1
it	1
began	1
equally	1
to	1
appear	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
they	1
should	1
continue	1
to	1
slaughter	1
one	1
another;	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
expressed	1
hesitation,	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
arose	1
in	1
every	1
soul:	1
"For	1
what,	1
for	1
whom,	1
must	1
I	1
kill	1
and	1
be	1
killed?...	1
You	1
may	1
go	1
and	1
kill	1
whom	1
you	1
please,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
anymore!"	1
By	1
evening	1
this	1
thought	1
had	1
ripened	1
in	1
every	1
soul.	1
At	1
any	1
moment	1
these	1
men	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
seized	1
with	1
horror	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
and	1
might	1
have	1
thrown	1
up	1
everything	1
and	1
run	1
away	1
anywhere.	1
	1
But	1
though	1
toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
the	1
men	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing,	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
leave	1
off,	1
some	1
incomprehensible,	1
mysterious	1
power	1
continued	1
to	1
control	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
still	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
charges,	1
loaded,	1
aimed,	1
and	1
applied	1
the	1
match,	1
though	1
only	1
one	1
artilleryman	1
survived	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
three,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
stumbled	1
and	1
panted	1
with	1
fatigue,	1
perspiring	1
and	1
stained	1
with	1
blood	1
and	1
powder.	1
The	1
cannon	1
balls	1
flew	1
just	1
as	1
swiftly	1
and	1
cruelly	1
from	1
both	1
sides,	1
crushing	1
human	1
bodies,	1
and	1
that	1
terrible	1
work	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
Him	1
who	1
governs	1
men	1
and	1
worlds	1
continued.	1
	1
Anyone	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
disorganized	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that,	1
if	1
only	1
the	1
French	1
made	1
one	1
more	1
slight	1
effort,	1
it	1
would	1
disappear;	1
and	1
anyone	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
need	1
only	1
make	1
one	1
more	1
slight	1
effort	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
would	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
But	1
neither	1
the	1
French	1
nor	1
the	1
Russians	1
made	1
that	1
effort,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
battle	1
burned	1
slowly	1
out.	1
	1
The	1
Russians	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
that	1
effort	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
attacking	1
the	1
French.	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
they	1
stood	1
blocking	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
they	1
still	1
did	1
so	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
But	1
even	1
had	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
been	1
to	1
drive	1
the	1
French	1
from	1
their	1
positions,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
this	1
last	1
effort,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
up,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
though	1
still	1
holding	1
their	1
positions	1
they	1
had	1
lost	1
ONE	1
HALF	1
of	1
their	1
army.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
with	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
former	1
victories	1
during	1
fifteen	1
years,	1
with	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
invincibility,	1
with	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
captured	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
only	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
their	1
men	1
and	1
still	1
had	1
their	1
Guards	1
intact,	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
strong,	1
might	1
easily	1
have	1
made	1
that	1
effort.	1
The	1
French	1
who	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
drive	1
it	1
from	1
its	1
position	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
that	1
effort,	1
for	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
Russians	1
continued	1
to	1
block	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Moscow	1
as	1
before,	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
attained	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
efforts	1
and	1
losses	1
were	1
in	1
vain.	1
But	1
the	1
French	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
that	1
effort.	1
Some	1
historians	1
say	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
need	1
only	1
have	1
used	1
his	1
Old	1
Guards,	1
who	1
were	1
intact,	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
won.	1
To	1
speak	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
Napoleon	1
sent	1
his	1
Guards	1
is	1
like	1
talking	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
if	1
autumn	1
became	1
spring.	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
be.	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
his	1
Guards,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to,	1
but	1
because	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done.	1
All	1
the	1
generals,	1
officers,	1
and	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
knew	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done,	1
because	1
the	1
flagging	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
it.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
Napoleon	1
alone	1
who	1
had	1
experienced	1
that	1
nightmare	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
arm	1
being	1
stricken	1
powerless,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
generals	1
and	1
soldiers	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
whether	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
or	1
not,	1
after	1
all	1
their	1
experience	1
of	1
previous	1
battles--when	1
after	1
one	1
tenth	1
of	1
such	1
efforts	1
the	1
enemy	1
had	1
fled--experienced	1
a	1
similar	1
feeling	1
of	1
terror	1
before	1
an	1
enemy	1
who,	1
after	1
losing	1
HALF	1
his	1
men,	1
stood	1
as	1
threateningly	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
The	1
moral	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
attacking	1
French	1
army	1
was	1
exhausted.	1
Not	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
victory	1
which	1
is	1
defined	1
by	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
pieces	1
of	1
material	1
fastened	1
to	1
sticks,	1
called	1
standards,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
had	1
stood	1
and	1
were	1
standing,	1
but	1
a	1
moral	1
victory	1
that	1
convinces	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
moral	1
superiority	1
of	1
his	1
opponent	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
impotence	1
was	1
gained	1
by	1
the	1
Russians	1
at	1
Borodino.	1
The	1
French	1
invaders,	1
like	1
an	1
infuriated	1
animal	1
that	1
has	1
in	1
its	1
onslaught	1
received	1
a	1
mortal	1
wound,	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
perishing,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
stop,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
weaker	1
by	1
one	1
half,	1
could	1
help	1
swerving.	1
By	1
impetus	1
gained,	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
was	1
still	1
able	1
to	1
roll	1
forward	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
there,	1
without	1
further	1
effort	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Russians,	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
perish,	1
bleeding	1
from	1
the	1
mortal	1
wound	1
it	1
had	1
received	1
at	1
Borodino.	1
The	1
direct	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
Napoleon's	1
senseless	1
flight	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
his	1
retreat	1
along	1
the	1
old	1
Smolensk	1
road,	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
invading	1
army	1
of	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
downfall	1
of	1
Napoleonic	1
France,	1
on	1
which	1
at	1
Borodino	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
an	1
opponent	1
of	1
stronger	1
spirit	1
had	1
been	1
laid.	1

of	1
any	1
kind	1
become	1
comprehensible	1
to	1
man	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
examines	1
arbitrarily	1
selected	1
elements	1
of	1
that	1
motion;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
a	1
large	1
proportion	1
of	1
human	1
error	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
arbitrary	1
division	1
of	1
continuous	1
motion	1
into	1
discontinuous	1
elements.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
well	1
known,	1
so-called	1
sophism	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
consisting	1
in	1
this,	1
that	1
Achilles	1
could	1
never	1
catch	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
tortoise	1
he	1
was	1
following,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
traveled	1
ten	1
times	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
tortoise.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
Achilles	1
has	1
covered	1
the	1
distance	1
that	1
separated	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
tortoise,	1
the	1
tortoise	1
has	1
covered	1
one	1
tenth	1
of	1
that	1
distance	1
ahead	1
of	1
him:	1
when	1
Achilles	1
has	1
covered	1
that	1
tenth,	1
the	1
tortoise	1
has	1
covered	1
another	1
one	1
hundredth,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
forever.	1
This	1
problem	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
ancients	1
insoluble.	1
The	1
absurd	1
answer	1
(that	1
Achilles	1
could	1
never	1
overtake	1
the	1
tortoise)	1
resulted	1
from	1
this:	1
that	1
motion	1
was	1
arbitrarily	1
divided	1
into	1
discontinuous	1
elements,	1
whereas	1
the	1
motion	1
both	1
of	1
Achilles	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
tortoise	1
was	1
continuous.	1
	1
By	1
adopting	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller	1
elements	1
of	1
motion	1
we	1
only	1
approach	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
problem,	1
but	1
never	1
reach	1
it.	1
Only	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
admitted	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
infinitely	1
small,	1
and	1
the	1
resulting	1
geometrical	1
progression	1
with	1
a	1
common	1
ratio	1
of	1
one	1
tenth,	1
and	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
this	1
progression	1
to	1
infinity,	1
do	1
we	1
reach	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
problem.	1
	1
A	1
modern	1
branch	1
of	1
mathematics	1
having	1
achieved	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
infinitely	1
small	1
can	1
now	1
yield	1
solutions	1
in	1
other	1
more	1
complex	1
problems	1
of	1
motion	1
which	1
used	1
to	1
appear	1
insoluble.	1
	1
This	1
modern	1
branch	1
of	1
mathematics,	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
ancients,	1
when	1
dealing	1
with	1
problems	1
of	1
motion	1
admits	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
infinitely	1
small,	1
and	1
so	1
conforms	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
condition	1
of	1
motion	1
(absolute	1
continuity)	1
and	1
thereby	1
corrects	1
the	1
inevitable	1
error	1
which	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
cannot	1
avoid	1
when	1
it	1
deals	1
with	1
separate	1
elements	1
of	1
motion	1
instead	1
of	1
examining	1
continuous	1
motion.	1
	1
In	1
seeking	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
historical	1
movement	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
happens.	1
The	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity,	1
arising	1
as	1
it	1
does	1
from	1
innumerable	1
arbitrary	1
human	1
wills,	1
is	1
continuous.	1
	1
To	1
understand	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
this	1
continuous	1
movement	1
is	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
history.	1
But	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
these	1
laws,	1
resulting	1
from	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
human	1
wills,	1
man's	1
mind	1
postulates	1
arbitrary	1
and	1
disconnected	1
units.	1
The	1
first	1
method	1
of	1
history	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
arbitrarily	1
selected	1
series	1
of	1
continuous	1
events	1
and	1
examine	1
it	1
apart	1
from	1
others,	1
though	1
there	1
is	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
beginning	1
to	1
any	1
event,	1
for	1
one	1
event	1
always	1
flows	1
uninterruptedly	1
from	1
another.	1
	1
The	1
second	1
method	1
is	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
man--a	1
king	1
or	1
a	1
commander--as	1
equivalent	1
to	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
many	1
individual	1
wills;	1
whereas	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
individual	1
wills	1
is	1
never	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
historic	1
personage.	1
	1
Historical	1
science	1
in	1
its	1
endeavor	1
to	1
draw	1
nearer	1
to	1
truth	1
continually	1
takes	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller	1
units	1
for	1
examination.	1
But	1
however	1
small	1
the	1
units	1
it	1
takes,	1
we	1
feel	1
that	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
unit	1
disconnected	1
from	1
others,	1
or	1
to	1
assume	1
a	1
beginning	1
of	1
any	1
phenomenon,	1
or	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
many	1
men	1
is	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
historic	1
personage,	1
is	1
in	1
itself	1
false.	1
	1
It	1
needs	1
no	1
critical	1
exertion	1
to	1
reduce	1
utterly	1
to	1
dust	1
any	1
deductions	1
drawn	1
from	1
history.	1
It	1
is	1
merely	1
necessary	1
to	1
select	1
some	1
larger	1
or	1
smaller	1
unit	1
as	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
observation--as	1
criticism	1
has	1
every	1
right	1
to	1
do,	1
seeing	1
that	1
whatever	1
unit	1
history	1
observes	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
arbitrarily	1
selected.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
taking	1
infinitesimally	1
small	1
units	1
for	1
observation	1
(the	1
differential	1
of	1
history,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
individual	1
tendencies	1
of	1
men)	1
and	1
attaining	1
to	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
integrating	1
them	1
(that	1
is,	1
finding	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
these	1
infinitesimals)	1
can	1
we	1
hope	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
fifteen	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
in	1
Europe	1
present	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
movement	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
people.	1
Men	1
leave	1
their	1
customary	1
pursuits,	1
hasten	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
Europe	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
plunder	1
and	1
slaughter	1
one	1
another,	1
triumph	1
and	1
are	1
plunged	1
in	1
despair,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
years	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
altered	1
and	1
presents	1
an	1
intensive	1
movement	1
which	1
first	1
increases	1
and	1
then	1
slackens.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
movement,	1
by	1
what	1
laws	1
was	1
it	1
governed?	1
asks	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
The	1
historians,	1
replying	1
to	1
this	1
question,	1
lay	1
before	1
us	1
the	1
sayings	1
and	1
doings	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
dozen	1
men	1
in	1
a	1
building	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Paris,	1
calling	1
these	1
sayings	1
and	1
doings	1
"the	1
Revolution";	1
then	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
detailed	1
biography	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
of	1
certain	1
people	1
favorable	1
or	1
hostile	1
to	1
him;	1
tell	1
of	1
the	1
influence	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
had	1
on	1
others,	1
and	1
say:	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
this	1
movement	1
took	1
place	1
and	1
those	1
are	1
its	1
laws.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
man	1
not	1
only	1
refuses	1
to	1
believe	1
this	1
explanation,	1
but	1
plainly	1
says	1
that	1
this	1
method	1
of	1
explanation	1
is	1
fallacious,	1
because	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
weaker	1
phenomenon	1
is	1
taken	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
a	1
stronger.	1
The	1
sum	1
of	1
human	1
wills	1
produced	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
those	1
wills	1
first	1
tolerated	1
and	1
then	1
destroyed	1
them.	1
	1
"But	1
every	1
time	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
conquests	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
conquerors;	1
every	1
time	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
any	1
state	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
great	1
men,"	1
says	1
history.	1
And,	1
indeed,	1
human	1
reason	1
replies:	1
every	1
time	1
conquerors	1
appear	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
wars,	1
but	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
conquerors	1
caused	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
a	1
war	1
in	1
the	1
personal	1
activity	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
man.	1
Whenever	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
watch	1
and	1
its	1
hands	1
point	1
to	1
ten,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
bells	1
of	1
the	1
neighboring	1
church;	1
but	1
because	1
the	1
bells	1
begin	1
to	1
ring	1
when	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
clock	1
reach	1
ten,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
bells	1
is	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
watch.	1
	1
Whenever	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
a	1
locomotive	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
whistle	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
valves	1
opening	1
and	1
wheels	1
turning;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
whistling	1
and	1
the	1
turning	1
of	1
wheels	1
are	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
engine.	1
	1
The	1
peasants	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
cold	1
wind	1
blows	1
in	1
late	1
spring	1
because	1
the	1
oaks	1
are	1
budding,	1
and	1
really	1
every	1
spring	1
cold	1
winds	1
do	1
blow	1
when	1
the	1
oak	1
is	1
budding.	1
But	1
though	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
causes	1
the	1
cold	1
winds	1
to	1
blow	1
when	1
the	1
oak	1
buds	1
unfold,	1
I	1
cannot	1
agree	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
that	1
the	1
unfolding	1
of	1
the	1
oak	1
buds	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
cold	1
wind,	1
for	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
beyond	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
buds.	1
I	1
see	1
only	1
a	1
coincidence	1
of	1
occurrences	1
such	1
as	1
happens	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
and	1
however	1
carefully	1
I	1
observe	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
watch,	1
and	1
the	1
valves	1
and	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
engine,	1
and	1
the	1
oak,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
discover	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
bells	1
ringing,	1
the	1
engine	1
moving,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
winds	1
of	1
spring.	1
To	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
entirely	1
change	1
my	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
and	1
study	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
steam,	1
of	1
the	1
bells,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
wind.	1
History	1
must	1
do	1
the	1
same.	1
And	1
attempts	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
made.	1
	1
To	1
study	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
history	1
we	1
must	1
completely	1
change	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
our	1
observation,	1
must	1
leave	1
aside	1
kings,	1
ministers,	1
and	1
generals,	1
and	1
study	1
the	1
common,	1
infinitesimally	1
small	1
elements	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
masses	1
are	1
moved.	1
No	1
one	1
can	1
say	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
advance	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
toward	1
an	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
history;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
only	1
along	1
that	1
path	1
does	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
discovering	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
history	1
lie,	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
yet	1
not	1
a	1
millionth	1
part	1
as	1
much	1
mental	1
effort	1
has	1
been	1
applied	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
by	1
historians	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
devoted	1
to	1
describing	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
various	1
kings,	1
commanders,	1
and	1
ministers	1
and	1
propounding	1
the	1
historians'	1
own	1
reflections	1
concerning	1
these	1
actions.	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
The	1
forces	1
of	1
a	1
dozen	1
European	1
nations	1
burst	1
into	1
Russia.	1
The	1
Russian	1
army	1
and	1
people	1
avoided	1
a	1
collision	1
till	1
Smolensk	1
was	1
reached,	1
and	1
again	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
to	1
Borodino.	1
The	1
French	1
army	1
pushed	1
on	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
its	1
goal,	1
its	1
impetus	1
ever	1
increasing	1
as	1
it	1
neared	1
its	1
aim,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
velocity	1
of	1
a	1
falling	1
body	1
increases	1
as	1
it	1
approaches	1
the	1
earth.	1
Behind	1
it	1
were	1
seven	1
hundred	1
miles	1
of	1
hunger-stricken,	1
hostile	1
country;	1
ahead	1
were	1
a	1
few	1
dozen	1
miles	1
separating	1
it	1
from	1
its	1
goal.	1
Every	1
soldier	1
in	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
felt	1
this	1
and	1
the	1
invasion	1
moved	1
on	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
momentum.	1
	1
The	1
more	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
retreated	1
the	1
more	1
fiercely	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
flared	1
up,	1
and	1
while	1
it	1
retreated	1
the	1
army	1
increased	1
and	1
consolidated.	1
At	1
Borodino	1
a	1
collision	1
took	1
place.	1
Neither	1
army	1
was	1
broken	1
up,	1
but	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
retreated	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
collision	1
as	1
inevitably	1
as	1
a	1
ball	1
recoils	1
after	1
colliding	1
with	1
another	1
having	1
a	1
greater	1
momentum,	1
and	1
with	1
equal	1
inevitability	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
invasion	1
that	1
had	1
advanced	1
with	1
such	1
momentum	1
rolled	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
distance,	1
though	1
the	1
collision	1
had	1
deprived	1
it	1
of	1
all	1
its	1
force.	1
	1
The	1
Russians	1
retreated	1
eighty	1
miles--to	1
beyond	1
Moscow--and	1
the	1
French	1
reached	1
Moscow	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
standstill.	1
For	1
five	1
weeks	1
after	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
battle.	1
The	1
French	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
As	1
a	1
bleeding,	1
mortally	1
wounded	1
animal	1
licks	1
its	1
wounds,	1
they	1
remained	1
inert	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
five	1
weeks,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly,	1
with	1
no	1
fresh	1
reason,	1
fled	1
back:	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
dash	1
for	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
and	1
(after	1
a	1
victory--for	1
at	1

remained	1
theirs)	1
without	1
undertaking	1
a	1
single	1
serious	1
battle,	1
they	1
fled	1
still	1
more	1
rapidly	1
back	1
to	1
Smolensk,	1
beyond	1
Smolensk,	1
beyond	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
beyond	1
Vilna,	1
and	1
farther	1
still.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
of	1
August,	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
army	1
were	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
a	1
victory.	1
Kutuzov	1
reported	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
He	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
a	1
fresh	1
conflict	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
did	1
this	1
not	1
to	1
deceive	1
anyone,	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
beaten,	1
as	1
everyone	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
knew	1
it.	1
	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
evening	1
and	1
next	1
day	1
reports	1
came	1
in	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
of	1
unheard-of	1
losses,	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
half	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
a	1
fresh	1
battle	1
proved	1
physically	1
impossible.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
give	1
battle	1
before	1
information	1
had	1
been	1
collected,	1
the	1
wounded	1
gathered	1
in,	1
the	1
supplies	1
of	1
ammunition	1
replenished,	1
the	1
slain	1
reckoned	1
up,	1
new	1
officers	1
appointed	1
to	1
replace	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
had	1
food	1
and	1
sleep.	1
And	1
meanwhile,	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1
battle,	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
advanced	1
of	1
itself	1
upon	1
the	1
Russians,	1
carried	1
forward	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
momentum	1
now	1
seemingly	1
increased	1
in	1
inverse	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
square	1
of	1
the	1
distance	1
from	1
its	1
aim.	1
Kutuzov's	1
wish	1
was	1
to	1
attack	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
desired	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
But	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
attack	1
the	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
is	1
not	1
sufficient,	1
there	1
must	1
also	1
be	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
doing	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
possibility	1
did	1
not	1
exist.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
retreat	1
a	1
day's	1
march,	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
retreat	1
another	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
day's	1
march,	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September	1
when	1
the	1
army	1
drew	1
near	1
Moscow--despite	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
had	1
arisen	1
in	1
all	1
ranks--the	1
force	1
of	1
circumstances	1
compelled	1
it	1
to	1
retire	1
beyond	1
Moscow.	1
And	1
the	1
troops	1
retired	1
one	1
more,	1
last,	1
day's	1
march,	1
and	1
abandoned	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
For	1
people	1
accustomed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
plans	1
of	1
campaign	1
and	1
battles	1
are	1
made	1
by	1
generals--as	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
sitting	1
over	1
a	1
map	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
may	1
imagine	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
arranged	1
things	1
in	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
battle--the	1
questions	1
present	1
themselves:	1
Why	1
did	1
Kutuzov	1
during	1
the	1
retreat	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
or	1
that?	1
Why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
before	1
reaching	1
Fili?	1
Why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
retire	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
abandoning	1
Moscow?	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
People	1
accustomed	1
to	1
think	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
forget,	1
or	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
the	1
inevitable	1
conditions	1
which	1
always	1
limit	1
the	1
activities	1
of	1
any	1
commander	1
in	1
chief.	1
The	1
activity	1
of	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
does	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
resemble	1
the	1
activity	1
we	1
imagine	1
to	1
ourselves	1
when	1
we	1
sit	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
our	1
studies	1
examining	1
some	1
campaign	1
on	1
the	1
map,	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
troops	1
on	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
side	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
known	1
locality,	1
and	1
begin	1
our	1
plans	1
from	1
some	1
given	1
moment.	1
A	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
never	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
any	1
event--the	1
position	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
always	1
contemplate	1
it.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
shifting	1
events	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
never	1
can	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
consider	1
the	1
whole	1
import	1
of	1
an	1
event	1
that	1
is	1
occurring.	1
Moment	1
by	1
moment	1
the	1
event	1
is	1
imperceptibly	1
shaping	1
itself,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
this	1
continuous,	1
uninterrupted	1
shaping	1
of	1
events	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
complex	1
play	1
of	1
intrigues,	1
worries,	1
contingencies,	1
authorities,	1
projects,	1
counsels,	1
threats,	1
and	1
deceptions	1
and	1
is	1
continually	1
obliged	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
innumerable	1
questions	1
addressed	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
constantly	1
conflict	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Learned	1
military	1
authorities	1
quite	1
seriously	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
should	1
have	1
moved	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
long	1
before	1
reaching	1
Fili,	1
and	1
that	1
somebody	1
actually	1
submitted	1
such	1
a	1
proposal	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
a	1
commander	1
in	1
chief,	1
especially	1
at	1
a	1
difficult	1
moment,	1
has	1
always	1
before	1
him	1
not	1
one	1
proposal	1
but	1
dozens	1
simultaneously.	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
proposals,	1
based	1
on	1
strategics	1
and	1
tactics,	1
contradict	1
each	1
other.	1
	1
A	1
commander-in-chief's	1
business,	1
it	1
would	1
seem,	1
is	1
simply	1
to	1
choose	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
projects.	1
But	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
do.	1
Events	1
and	1
time	1
do	1
not	1
wait.	1
For	1
instance,	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
it	1
is	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
cross	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
an	1
adjutant	1
gallops	1
up	1
from	1
Miloradovich	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
engage	1
the	1
French	1
or	1
retire.	1
An	1
order	1
must	1
be	1
given	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
that	1
instant.	1
And	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
retreat	1
carries	1
us	1
past	1
the	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
adjutant	1
comes	1
the	1
commissary	1
general	1
asking	1
where	1
the	1
stores	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
hospitals	1
asks	1
where	1
the	1
wounded	1
are	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
a	1
courier	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
brings	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
sovereign	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
abandoning	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
commander-in-	1
chief's	1
rival,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
undermining	1
him	1
(and	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
not	1
merely	1
one	1
but	1
several	1
such),	1
presents	1
a	1
new	1
project	1
diametrically	1
opposed	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
and	1
the	1
commander-in-	1
chief	1
himself	1
needs	1
sleep	1
and	1
refreshment	1
to	1
maintain	1
his	1
energy	1
and	1
a	1
respectable	1
general	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
overlooked	1
in	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
rewards	1
comes	1
to	1
complain,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
pray	1
to	1
be	1
defended,	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
sent	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
locality	1
comes	1
in	1
and	1
gives	1
a	1
report	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
the	1
officer	1
previously	1
sent;	1
and	1
a	1
spy,	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
and	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
on	1
reconnaissance,	1
all	1
describe	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
army	1
differently.	1
People	1
accustomed	1
to	1
misunderstand	1
or	1
to	1
forget	1
these	1
inevitable	1
conditions	1
of	1
a	1
commander-in-chief's	1
actions	1
describe	1
to	1
us,	1
for	1
instance,	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
at	1
Fili	1
and	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
could,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
quite	1
freely	1
decide	1
whether	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow	1
or	1
defend	1
it;	1
whereas,	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
less	1
than	1
four	1
miles	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
no	1
such	1
question	1
existed.	1
When	1
had	1
that	1
question	1
been	1
settled?	1
At	1
Drissa	1
and	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
most	1
palpably	1
of	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fourth	1
of	1
August	1
at	1
Shevardino	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-	1
sixth	1
at	1
Borodino,	1
and	1
each	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
and	1
minute	1
of	1
the	1
retreat	1
from	1
Borodino	1
to	1
Fili.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
When	1
Ermolov,	1
having	1
been	1
sent	1
by	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
position,	1
told	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
fight	1
there	1
before	1
Moscow	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
retreat,	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
your	1
hand,"	1
said	1
he	1
and,	1
turning	1
it	1
over	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
pulse,	1
added:	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
well,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
Think	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying!"	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
could	1
not	1
yet	1
admit	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
retreating	1
beyond	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill,	1
four	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
gate	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
Kutuzov	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
by	1
the	1
roadside.	1
A	1
great	1
crowd	1
of	1
generals	1
gathered	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
joined	1
them.	1
This	1
brilliant	1
company	1
separated	1
into	1
several	1
groups	1
who	1
all	1
discussed	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
the	1
position,	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
the	1
plans	1
suggested,	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
military	1
questions	1
generally.	1
Though	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
summoned	1
for	1
the	1
purpose,	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
called,	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
war.	1
The	1
conversations	1
all	1
dealt	1
with	1
public	1
questions.	1
If	1
anyone	1
gave	1
or	1
asked	1
for	1
personal	1
news,	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
and	1
they	1
immediately	1
reverted	1
to	1
general	1
matters.	1
No	1
jokes,	1
or	1
laughter,	1
or	1
smiles	1
even,	1
were	1
seen	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
men.	1
They	1
evidently	1
all	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
hold	1
themselves	1
at	1
the	1
height	1
the	1
situation	1
demanded.	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
groups,	1
while	1
talking	1
among	1
themselves,	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
near	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
(whose	1
bench	1
formed	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
gathering)	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
overhear	1
them.	1
The	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
and	1
sometimes	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
repeat	1
their	1
remarks,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversations	1
or	1
express	1
any	1
opinion.	1
After	1
hearing	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
these	1
groups	1
he	1
generally	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
disappointment,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
anything	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
hear.	1
Some	1
discussed	1
the	1
position	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
chosen,	1
criticizing	1
not	1
the	1
position	1
itself	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
mental	1
capacity	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
chosen	1
it.	1
Others	1
argued	1
that	1
a	1
mistake	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
earlier	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
battle	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
fought	1
two	1
days	1
before.	1
Others	1
again	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Salamanca,	1
which	1
was	1
described	1
by	1
Crosart,	1
a	1
newly	1
arrived	1
Frenchman	1
in	1
a	1
Spanish	1
uniform.	1
(This	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
German	1
princes	1
serving	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
were	1
discussing	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Saragossa	1
and	1
considering	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
defending	1
Moscow	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
manner.)	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
telling	1
a	1
fourth	1
group	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
the	1
city	1
train	1
bands	1
under	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
capital,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
still	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
regretting	1
having	1
been	1
left	1
in	1
ignorance	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening,	1
and	1
that	1
had	1
he	1
known	1
it	1
sooner	1
things	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
different....	1
A	1
fifth	1
group,	1
displaying	1
the	1
profundity	1
of	1
their	1
strategic	1
perceptions,	1
discussed	1
the	1
direction	1
the	1
troops	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
to	1
take.	1
A	1
sixth	1
group	1
was	1
talking	1
absolute	1
nonsense.	1
Kutuzov's	1
expression	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
preoccupied	1
and	1
gloomy.	1
From	1
all	1
this	1
talk	1
he	1
saw	1
only	1
one	1
thing:	1
that	1
to	1
defend	1
Moscow	1
was	1
a	1
physical	1
impossibility	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
meaning	1
of	1
those	1
words,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
so	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
senseless	1
commander	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
orders	1
to	1
fight,	1
confusion	1
would	1
result	1
but	1
the	1
battle	1
would	1
still	1
not	1
take	1
place.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
place	1
because	1
the	1
commanders	1
not	1
merely	1
all	1
recognized	1
the	1
position	1
to	1
be	1
impossible,	1
but	1
in	1
their	1
conversations	1
were	1
only	1
discussing	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
after	1
its	1
inevitable	1
abandonment.	1
How	1
could	1
the	1
commanders	1
lead	1
their	1
troops	1
to	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
they	1
considered	1
impossible	1
to	1
hold?	1
The	1
lower-grade	1
officers	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
soldiers	1
(who	1
too	1
reason)	1
also	1
considered	1
the	1
position	1
impossible	1
and	1
therefore	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
fight,	1
fully	1
convinced	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
defeat.	1
If	1
Bennigsen	1
insisted	1
on	1
the	1
position	1
being	1
defended	1
and	1
others	1
still	1
discussed	1
it,	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
important	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
pretext	1
for	1
disputes	1
and	1
intrigue.	1
This	1
Kutuzov	1
knew	1
well.	1
	1
Bennigsen,	1
who	1
had	1
chosen	1
the	1
position,	1
warmly	1
displayed	1
his	1
Russian	1
patriotism	1
(Kutuzov	1
could	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
this	1
without	1
wincing)	1
by	1
insisting	1
that	1
Moscow	1
must	1
be	1
defended.	1
His	1
aim	1
was	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
daylight	1
to	1
Kutuzov:	1
if	1
the	1
defense	1
failed,	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
Kutuzov	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
army	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
Sparrow	1
Hills	1
without	1
giving	1
battle;	1
if	1
it	1
succeeded,	1
to	1
claim	1
the	1
success	1
as	1
his	1
own;	1
or	1
if	1
battle	1
were	1
not	1
given,	1
to	1
clear	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
crime	1
of	1
abandoning	1
Moscow.	1
But	1
this	1
intrigue	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
occupy	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
mind.	1
One	1
terrible	1
question	1
absorbed	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
question	1
he	1
heard	1
no	1
reply	1
from	1
anyone.	1
The	1
question	1
for	1
him	1
now	1
was:	1
"Have	1
I	1
really	1
allowed	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
reach	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
when	1
did	1
I	1
do	1
so?	1
When	1
was	1
it	1
decided?	1
Can	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
yesterday	1
when	1
I	1
ordered	1
Platov	1
to	1
retreat,	1
or	1
was	1
it	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
nap	1
and	1
told	1
Bennigsen	1
to	1
issue	1
orders?	1
Or	1
was	1
it	1
earlier	1
still?...	1
When,	1
when	1
was	1
this	1
terrible	1
affair	1
decided?	1
Moscow	1
must	1
be	1
abandoned.	1
The	1
army	1
must	1
retreat	1
and	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
must	1
be	1
given."	1
To	1
give	1
that	1
terrible	1
order	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
equivalent	1
to	1
resigning	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
he	1
love	1
power	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
accustomed	1
(the	1
honours	1
awarded	1
to	1
Prince	1
Prozorovski,	1
under	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
served	1
in	1
Turkey,	1
galled	1
him),	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
save	1
Russia	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
why,	1
against	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
wish	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
chosen	1
commander-in-chief.	1
He	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
maintain	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
in	1
these	1
difficult	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
encounter	1
the	1
invincible	1
Napoleon	1
without	1
fear,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
issue.	1
But	1
something	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
decided,	1
and	1
these	1
conversations	1
around	1
him	1
which	1
were	1
assuming	1
too	1
free	1
a	1
character	1
must	1
be	1
stopped.	1
	1
He	1
called	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
generals	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"My	1
head,	1
be	1
it	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
itself,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
bench,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
to	1
Fili	1
where	1
his	1
carriages	1
were	1
waiting.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
The	1
Council	1
of	1
War	1
began	1
to	1
assemble	1
at	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
in	1
the	1
better	1
and	1
roomier	1
part	1
of	1
Andrew	1
Savostyanov's	1
hut.	1
The	1
men,	1
women,	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
peasant	1
family	1
crowded	1
into	1
the	1
back	1
room	1
across	1
the	1
passage.	1
Only	1
Malasha,	1
Andrew's	1
six-year-old	1
granddaughter	1
whom	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
had	1
petted	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
sugar	1
while	1
drinking	1
his	1
tea,	1
remained	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
brick	1
oven	1
in	1
the	1
larger	1
room.	1
Malasha	1
looked	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
oven	1
with	1
shy	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
faces,	1
uniforms,	1
and	1
decorations	1
of	1
the	1
generals,	1
who	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
broad	1
benches	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
under	1
the	1
icons.	1
"Granddad"	1
himself,	1
as	1
Malasha	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
called	1
Kutuzov,	1
sat	1
apart	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
corner	1
behind	1
the	1
oven.	1
He	1
sat,	1
sunk	1
deep	1
in	1
a	1
folding	1
armchair,	1
and	1
continually	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
unbuttoned,	1
still	1
seemed	1
to	1
pinch	1
his	1
neck.	1
Those	1
who	1
entered	1
went	1
up	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
marshal;	1
he	1
pressed	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
some	1
and	1
nodded	1
to	1
others.	1
His	1
adjutant	1
Kaysarov	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
draw	1
back	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
facing	1
Kutuzov,	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
moved	1
his	1
hand	1
angrily	1
and	1
Kaysarov	1
understood	1
that	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
	1
Round	1
the	1
peasant's	1
deal	1
table,	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
maps,	1
plans,	1
pencils,	1
and	1
papers,	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
gathered	1
that	1
the	1
orderlies	1
brought	1
in	1
another	1
bench	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
beside	1
the	1
table.	1
Ermolov,	1
Kaysarov,	1
and	1
Toll,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
arrived,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
this	1
bench.	1
In	1
the	1
foremost	1
place,	1
immediately	1
under	1
the	1
icons,	1
sat	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly,	1
his	1
high	1
forehead	1
merging	1
into	1
his	1
bald	1
crown.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
St.	1
George's	1
Cross	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
looked	1
pale	1
and	1
ill.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
feverish	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
shivering	1
and	1
in	1
pain.	1
Beside	1
him	1
sat	1
Uvarov,	1
who	1
with	1
rapid	1
gesticulations	1
was	1
giving	1
him	1
some	1
information,	1
speaking	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
did.	1
Chubby	1
little	1
Dokhturov	1
was	1
listening	1
attentively	1
with	1
eyebrows	1
raised	1
and	1
arms	1
folded	1
on	1
his	1
stomach.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
sat	1
Count	1
Ostermann-	1
Tolstoy,	1
seemingly	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts.	1
His	1
broad	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
bold	1
features	1
and	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
was	1
resting	1
on	1
his	1
hand.	1
Raevski,	1
twitching	1
forward	1
the	1
black	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
temples	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
habit,	1
glanced	1
now	1
at	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
impatience.	1
Konovnitsyn's	1
firm,	1
handsome,	1
and	1
kindly	1
face	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
tender,	1
sly	1
smile.	1
His	1
glance	1
met	1
Malasha's,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
caused	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
to	1
smile.	1
	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
waiting	1
for	1
Bennigsen,	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
inspecting	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
finishing	1
his	1
savory	1
dinner.	1
They	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
four	1
till	1
six	1
o'clock	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
their	1
deliberations	1
all	1
that	1
time	1
but	1
talked	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
of	1
other	1
matters.	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
Bennigsen	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
hut	1
did	1
Kutuzov	1
leave	1
his	1
corner	1
and	1
draw	1
toward	1
the	1
table,	1
but	1
not	1
near	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
candles	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
there	1
to	1
light	1
up	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
Bennigsen	1
opened	1
the	1
council	1
with	1
the	1
question:	1
"Are	1
we	1
to	1
abandon	1
Russia's	1
ancient	1
and	1
sacred	1
capital	1
without	1
a	1
struggle,	1
or	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
defend	1
it?"	1
A	1
prolonged	1
and	1
general	1
silence	1
followed.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
frown	1
on	1
every	1
face	1
and	1
only	1
Kutuzov's	1
angry	1
grunts	1
and	1
occasional	1
cough	1
broke	1
the	1
silence.	1
All	1
eyes	1
were	1
gazing	1
at	1
him.	1
Malasha	1
too	1
looked	1
at	1
"Granddad."	1
She	1
was	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
saw	1
how	1
his	1
face	1
puckered;	1
he	1
seemed	1
about	1
to	1
cry,	1
but	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long.	1
	1
"Russia's	1
ancient	1
and	1
sacred	1
capital!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
said,	1
repeating	1
Bennigsen's	1
words	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
voice	1
and	1
thereby	1
drawing	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
false	1
note	1
in	1
them.	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
that	1
that	1
question	1
has	1
no	1
meaning	1
for	1
a	1
Russian."	1
(He	1
lurched	1
his	1
heavy	1
body	1
forward.)	1
"Such	1
a	1
question	1
cannot	1
be	1
put;	1
it	1
is	1
senseless!	1
The	1
question	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
to	1
meet	1
to	1
discuss	1
is	1
a	1
military	1
one.	1
The	1
question	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
saving	1
Russia.	1
Is	1
it	1
better	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle,	1
or	1
by	1
accepting	1
battle	1
to	1
risk	1
losing	1
the	1
army	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Moscow?	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
question	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
want	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
and	1
he	1
sank	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair.	1
	1
The	1
discussion	1
began.	1
Bennigsen	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
consider	1
his	1
game	1
lost.	1
Admitting	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
Barclay	1
and	1
others	1
that	1
a	1
defensive	1
battle	1
at	1
Fili	1
was	1
impossible,	1
but	1
imbued	1
with	1
Russian	1
patriotism	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
proposed	1
to	1
move	1
troops	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
right	1
flank	1
the	1
following	1
day.	1
Opinions	1
were	1
divided,	1
and	1
arguments	1
were	1
advanced	1
for	1
and	1
against	1
that	1
project.	1
Ermolov,	1
Dokhturov,	1
and	1
Raevski	1
agreed	1
with	1
Bennigsen.	1
Whether	1
feeling	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
before	1
abandoning	1
the	1
capital	1
or	1
guided	1
by	1
other,	1
personal	1
considerations,	1
these	1
generals	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
this	1
council	1
could	1
not	1
alter	1
the	1
inevitable	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
and	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
in	1
effect	1
already	1
abandoned.	1
The	1
other	1
generals,	1
however,	1
understood	1
it	1
and,	1
leaving	1
aside	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
direction	1
the	1
army	1
should	1
take	1
in	1
its	1
retreat.	1
Malasha,	1
who	1
kept	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
before	1
her,	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
differently.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
personal	1
struggle	1
between	1
"Granddad"	1
and	1
"Long-coat"	1
as	1
she	1
termed	1
Bennigsen.	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
grew	1
spiteful	1
when	1
they	1
spoke	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
sided	1
with	1
"Granddad."	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
noticed	1
"Granddad"	1
give	1
Bennigsen	1
a	1
quick,	1
subtle	1
glance,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
her	1
joys	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
"Granddad"	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
"Long-coat"	1
which	1
settled	1
him.	1
Bennigsen	1
suddenly	1
reddened	1
and	1
paced	1
angrily	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
What	1
so	1
affected	1
him	1
was	1
Kutuzov's	1
calm	1
and	1
quiet	1
comment	1
on	1
the	1
advantage	1
or	1
disadvantage	1
of	1
Bennigsen's	1
proposal	1
to	1
move	1
troops	1
by	1
night	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
right	1
wing.	1
	1
"Gentlemen,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
approve	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
plan.	1
Moving	1
troops	1
in	1
close	1
proximity	1
to	1
an	1
enemy	1
is	1
always	1
dangerous,	1
and	1
military	1
history	1
supports	1
that	1
view.	1
For	1
instance..."	1
Kutuzov	1
seemed	1
to	1
reflect,	1
searching	1
for	1
an	1
example,	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
clear,	1
naive	1
look	1
at	1
Bennigsen	1
he	1
added:	1
"Oh	1
yes;	1
take	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Friedland,	1
which	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
count	1
well	1
remembers,	1
and	1
which	1
was...	1
not	1
fully	1
successful,	1
only	1
because	1
our	1
troops	1
were	1
rearranged	1
too	1
near	1
the	1
enemy..."	1
	1
There	1
followed	1
a	1
momentary	1
pause,	1
which	1
seemed	1
very	1
long	1
to	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
The	1
discussion	1
recommenced,	1
but	1
pauses	1
frequently	1
occurred	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said.	1
	1
During	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
pauses	1
Kutuzov	1
heaved	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
as	1
if	1
preparing	1
to	1
speak.	1
They	1
all	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
gentlemen,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
who	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
broken	1
crockery,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
rising	1
slowly	1
he	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1
"Gentlemen,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
your	1
views.	1
Some	1
of	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
me.	1
But	1
I,"	1
he	1
paused,	1
"by	1
the	1
authority	1
entrusted	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
Sovereign	1
and	1
country,	1
order	1
a	1
retreat."	1
	1
After	1
that	1
the	1
generals	1
began	1
to	1
disperse	1
with	1
the	1
solemnity	1
and	1
circumspect	1
silence	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
leaving,	1
after	1
a	1
funeral.	1
	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
generals,	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
strain	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
had	1
spoken	1
during	1
the	1
council,	1
communicated	1
something	1
to	1
their	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
Malasha,	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
expected	1
for	1
supper,	1
climbed	1
carefully	1
backwards	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
oven,	1
her	1
bare	1
little	1
feet	1
catching	1
at	1
its	1
projections,	1
and	1
slipping	1
between	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
she	1
darted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
dismissed	1
the	1
generals	1
Kutuzov	1
sat	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
thinking	1
always	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
terrible	1
question:	1
"When,	1
when	1
did	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow	1
become	1
inevitable?	1
When	1
was	1
that	1
done	1
which	1
settled	1
the	1
matter?	1
And	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
this,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
adjutant	1
Schneider	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
came	1
in	1
late	1
that	1
night.	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
this!	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
this	1
would	1
happen."	1
	1
"You	1
should	1
take	1
some	1
rest,	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness,"	1
replied	1
Schneider.	1
	1
"But	1
no!	1
They	1
shall	1
eat	1
horseflesh	1
yet,	1
like	1
the	1
Turks!"	1
exclaimed	1
Kutuzov	1
without	1
replying,	1
striking	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
podgy	1
fist.	1
"They	1
shall	1
too,	1
if	1
only..."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
At	1
that	1
very	1
time,	1
in	1
circumstances	1
even	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
retreating	1
without	1
a	1
battle,	1
namely	1
the	1
evacuation	1
and	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
Rostopchin,	1
who	1
is	1
usually	1
represented	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
instigator	1
of	1
that	1
event,	1
acted	1
in	1
an	1
altogether	1
different	1
manner	1
from	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
the	1
abandonment	1
and	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
was	1
as	1
inevitable	1
as	1
the	1
retreat	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
beyond	1
Moscow	1
without	1
fighting.	1
	1
Every	1
Russian	1
might	1
have	1
predicted	1
it,	1
not	1
by	1
reasoning	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
feeling	1
implanted	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
fathers.	1
	1
The	1
same	1
thing	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
Moscow	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
towns	1
and	1
villages	1
on	1
Russian	1
soil	1
beginning	1
with	1
Smolensk,	1
without	1
the	1
participation	1
of	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
and	1
his	1
broadsheets.	1
The	1
people	1
awaited	1
the	1
enemy	1
unconcernedly,	1
did	1
not	1
riot	1
or	1
become	1
excited	1
or	1
tear	1
anyone	1
to	1
pieces,	1
but	1
faced	1
its	1
fate,	1
feeling	1
within	1
it	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
find	1
what	1
it	1
should	1
do	1
at	1
that	1
most	1
difficult	1
moment.	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
enemy	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
wealthy	1
classes	1
went	1
away	1
abandoning	1
their	1
property,	1
while	1
the	1
poorer	1
remained	1
and	1
burned	1
and	1
destroyed	1
what	1
was	1
left.	1
	1
The	1
consciousness	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
so	1
was	1
and	1
is	1
present	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
every	1
Russian.	1
And	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
this,	1
and	1
a	1
foreboding	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
taken,	1
was	1
present	1
in	1
Russian	1
Moscow	1
society	1
in	1
1812.	1
Those	1
who	1
had	1
quitted	1
Moscow	1
already	1
in	1
July	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
August	1
showed	1
that	1
they	1
expected	1
this.	1
Those	1
who	1
went	1
away,	1
taking	1
what	1
they	1
could	1
and	1
abandoning	1
their	1
houses	1
and	1
half	1
their	1
belongings,	1
did	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
latent	1
patriotism	1
which	1
expresses	1
itself	1
not	1
by	1
phrases	1
or	1
by	1
giving	1
one's	1
children	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
fatherland	1
and	1
similar	1
unnatural	1
exploits,	1
but	1
unobtrusively,	1
simply,	1
organically,	1
and	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
always	1
produces	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
results.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
disgraceful	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
danger;	1
only	1
cowards	1
are	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
Moscow,"	1
they	1
were	1
told.	1
In	1
his	1
broadsheets	1
Rostopchin	1
impressed	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
was	1
shameful.	1
They	1
were	1
ashamed	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
cowards,	1
ashamed	1
to	1
leave,	1
but	1
still	1
they	1
left,	1
knowing	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
Why	1
did	1
they	1
go?	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
scared	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
accounts	1
of	1
horrors	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
committed	1
in	1
conquered	1
countries.	1
The	1
first	1
people	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
were	1
the	1
rich	1
educated	1
people	1
who	1
knew	1
quite	1
well	1
that	1
Vienna	1
and	1
Berlin	1
had	1
remained	1
intact	1
and	1
that	1
during	1
Napoleon's	1
occupation	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
had	1
spent	1
their	1
time	1
pleasantly	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
charming	1
Frenchmen	1
whom	1
the	1
Russians,	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
Russian	1
ladies,	1
then	1
liked	1
so	1
much.	1
	1
They	1
went	1
away	1
because	1
for	1
Russians	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
things	1
would	1
go	1
well	1
or	1
ill	1
under	1
French	1
rule	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
It	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
French	1
rule,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
worst	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
happen.	1
They	1
went	1
away	1
even	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
rapidly	1
after	1
it,	1
despite	1
Rostopchin's	1
calls	1
to	1
defend	1
Moscow	1
or	1
the	1
announcement	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
wonder-working	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Iberian	1
Mother	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
fight,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
balloons	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
despite	1
all	1
the	1
nonsense	1
Rostopchin	1
wrote	1
in	1
his	1
broadsheets.	1
They	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
fight,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
succeed	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
take	1
young	1
ladies	1
and	1
house	1
serfs	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
quarter	1
of	1
Moscow	1
to	1
fight	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
go	1
away,	1
sorry	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
abandon	1
their	1
property	1
to	1
destruction.	1
They	1
went	1
away	1
without	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
tremendous	1
significance	1
of	1
that	1
immense	1
and	1
wealthy	1
city	1
being	1
given	1
over	1
to	1
destruction,	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
city	1
with	1
wooden	1
buildings	1
was	1
certain	1
when	1
abandoned	1
by	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
to	1
be	1
burned.	1
They	1
went	1
away	1
each	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
account,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
their	1
going	1
away	1
that	1
the	1
momentous	1
event	1
was	1
accomplished	1
that	1
will	1
always	1
remain	1
the	1
greatest	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people.	1
The	1
lady	1
who,	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
stopped	1
by	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
orders,	1
had	1
already	1
in	1
June	1
moved	1
with	1
her	1
Negroes	1
and	1
her	1
women	1
jesters	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
her	1
Saratov	1
estate,	1
with	1
a	1
vague	1
consciousness	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
Bonaparte's	1
servant,	1
was	1
really,	1
simply,	1
and	1
truly	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
great	1
work	1
which	1
saved	1
Russia.	1
But	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
who	1
now	1
taunted	1
those	1
who	1
left	1
Moscow	1
and	1
now	1
had	1
the	1
government	1
offices	1
removed;	1
now	1
distributed	1
quite	1
useless	1
weapons	1
to	1
the	1
drunken	1
rabble;	1
now	1
had	1
processions	1
displaying	1
the	1
icons,	1
and	1
now	1
forbade	1
Father	1
Augustin	1
to	1
remove	1
icons	1
or	1
the	1
relics	1
of	1
saints;	1
now	1
seized	1
all	1
the	1
private	1
carts	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
on	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty-six	1
of	1
them	1
removed	1
the	1
balloon	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
constructed	1
by	1
Leppich;	1
now	1
hinted	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
burn	1
Moscow	1
and	1
related	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
now	1
wrote	1
a	1
proclamation	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
solemnly	1
upbraiding	1
them	1
for	1
having	1
destroyed	1
his	1
Orphanage;	1
now	1
claimed	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
having	1
hinted	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
burn	1
Moscow	1
and	1
now	1
repudiated	1
the	1
deed;	1
now	1
ordered	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
catch	1
all	1
spies	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
now	1
reproached	1
them	1
for	1
doing	1
so;	1
now	1
expelled	1
all	1
the	1
French	1
residents	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
now	1
allowed	1
Madame	1
Aubert-Chalme	1
(the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
French	1
colony	1
in	1
Moscow)	1
to	1
remain,	1
but	1
ordered	1
the	1
venerable	1
old	1
postmaster	1
Klyucharev	1
to	1
be	1
arrested	1
and	1
exiled	1
for	1
no	1
particular	1
offense;	1
now	1
assembled	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
now,	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
them,	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
killed	1
and	1
himself	1
drove	1
away	1
by	1
a	1
back	1
gate;	1
now	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
survive	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
now	1
wrote	1
French	1
verses	1
in	1
albums	1
concerning	1
his	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
affair--this	1
man	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
but	1
merely	1
wanted	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
himself	1
that	1
would	1
astonish	1
people,	1
to	1
perform	1
some	1
patriotically	1
heroic	1
feat;	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
he	1
made	1
sport	1
of	1
the	1
momentous,	1
and	1
unavoidable	1
event--	1
the	1
abandonment	1
and	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow--and	1
tried	1
with	1
his	1
puny	1
hand	1
now	1
to	1
speed	1
and	1
now	1
to	1
stay	1
the	1
enormous,	1
popular	1
tide	1
that	1
bore	1
him	1
along	1
with	1
it.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Helene,	1
having	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
court	1
from	1
Vilna	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
a	1
difficult	1
position.	1
	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
she	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
special	1
protection	1
of	1
a	1
grandee	1
who	1
occupied	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
posts	1
in	1
the	1
Empire.	1
In	1
Vilna	1
she	1
had	1
formed	1
an	1
intimacy	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
foreign	1
prince.	1
When	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
both	1
the	1
magnate	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
were	1
there,	1
and	1
both	1
claimed	1
their	1
rights.	1
Helene	1
was	1
faced	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
problem--how	1
to	1
preserve	1
her	1
intimacy	1
with	1
both	1
without	1
offending	1
either.	1
	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
difficult	1
or	1
even	1
impossible	1
to	1
another	1
woman	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
the	1
least	1
embarrassment	1
to	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova,	1
who	1
evidently	1
deserved	1
her	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
woman.	1
Had	1
she	1
attempted	1
concealment,	1
or	1
tried	1
to	1
extricate	1
herself	1
from	1
her	1
awkward	1
position	1
by	1
cunning,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
spoiled	1
her	1
case	1
by	1
acknowledging	1
herself	1
guilty.	1
But	1
Helene,	1
like	1
a	1
really	1
great	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
do	1
whatever	1
he	1
pleases,	1
at	1
once	1
assumed	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
to	1
be	1
correct,	1
as	1
she	1
sincerely	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
that	1
everyone	1
else	1
was	1
to	1
blame.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
young	1
foreigner	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
reproach	1
her,	1
she	1
lifted	1
her	1
beautiful	1
head	1
and,	1
half	1
turning	1
to	1
him,	1
said	1
firmly:	1
"That's	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
man--selfish	1
and	1
cruel!	1
I	1
expected	1
nothing	1
else.	1
A	1
woman	1
sacrifices	1
herself	1
for	1
you,	1
she	1
suffers,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
her	1
reward!	1
What	1
right	1
have	1
you,	1
monseigneur,	1
to	1
demand	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
attachments	1
and	1
friendships?	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
me!"	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
Helene	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
yes,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
other	1
sentiments	1
for	1
me	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
father,	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
shut	1
my	1
door	1
on	1
him.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
repay	1
kindness	1
with	1
ingratitude!	1
Know,	1
monseigneur,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
relates	1
to	1
my	1
intimate	1
feelings	1
I	1
render	1
account	1
only	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
conscience,"	1
she	1
concluded,	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
beautiful,	1
fully	1
expanded	1
bosom	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven.	1
	1
"But	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
listen	1
to	1
me!"	1
	1
"Marry	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
slave!"	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
impossible."	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
deign	1
to	1
demean	1
yourself	1
by	1
marrying	1
me,	1
you..."	1
said	1
Helene,	1
beginning	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
her,	1
but	1
Helene,	1
as	1
if	1
quite	1
distraught,	1
said	1
through	1
her	1
tears	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
marrying,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
precedents	1
(there	1
were	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
time	1
very	1
few,	1
but	1
she	1
mentioned	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
exalted	1
personages),	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
her	1
husband's	1
wife,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
sacrificed.	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
law,	1
religion..."	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
already	1
yielding.	1
	1
"The	1
law,	1
religion...	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
invented	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
can't	1
arrange	1
that?"	1
said	1
Helene.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
so	1
simple	1
an	1
idea	1
had	1
not	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
applied	1
for	1
advice	1
to	1
the	1
holy	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
intimate	1
terms.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
enchanting	1
fetes	1
which	1
Helene	1
gave	1
at	1
her	1
country	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Stone	1
Island,	1
the	1
charming	1
Monsieur	1
de	1
Jobert,	1
a	1
man	1
no	1
longer	1
young,	1
with	1
snow	1
white	1
hair	1
and	1
brilliant	1
black	1
eyes,	1
a	1
Jesuit	1
a	1
robe	1
courte	1
*	1
was	1
presented	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
illuminations	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
music	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
of	1
Christ,	1
of	1
the	1
Sacred	1
Heart,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
consolations	1
the	1
one	1
true	1
Catholic	1
religion	1
affords	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
next.	1
Helene	1
was	1
touched,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
tears	1
rose	1
to	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
Monsieur	1
de	1
Jobert	1
and	1
their	1
voices	1
trembled.	1
A	1
dance,	1
for	1
which	1
her	1
partner	1
came	1
to	1
seek	1
her,	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
her	1
discourse	1
with	1
her	1
future	1
directeur	1
de	1
conscience,	1
but	1
the	1
next	1
evening	1
Monsieur	1
de	1
Jobert	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
Helene	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
alone,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
often	1
came	1
again.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Lay	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
One	1
day	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
countess	1
to	1
a	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
church,	1
where	1
she	1
knelt	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
led.	1
The	1
enchanting,	1
middle-aged	1
Frenchman	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
and,	1
as	1
she	1
herself	1
afterward	1
described	1
it,	1
she	1
felt	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
fresh	1
breeze	1
wafted	1
into	1
her	1
soul.	1
It	1
was	1
explained	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
la	1
grace.	1
	1
After	1
that	1
a	1
long-frocked	1
abbe	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
confessed	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
absolved	1
her	1
from	1
her	1
sins.	1
Next	1
day	1
she	1
received	1
a	1
box	1
containing	1
the	1
Sacred	1
Host,	1
which	1
was	1
left	1
at	1
her	1
house	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
partake	1
of.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
Helene	1
learned	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
Catholic	1
Church	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
the	1
Pope	1
himself	1
would	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
would	1
send	1
her	1
a	1
certain	1
document.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
around	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
all	1
the	1
attention	1
devoted	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
so	1
many	1
clever	1
men	1
and	1
expressed	1
in	1
such	1
pleasant,	1
refined	1
ways,	1
and	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
dove-like	1
purity	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
(she	1
wore	1
only	1
white	1
dresses	1
and	1
white	1
ribbons	1
all	1
that	1
time)	1
gave	1
her	1
pleasure,	1
but	1
her	1
pleasure	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
forget	1
her	1
aim.	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
happens	1
in	1
contests	1
of	1
cunning	1
that	1
a	1
stupid	1
person	1
gets	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
cleverer	1
ones,	1
Helene--having	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
main	1
object	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
trouble	1
was,	1
after	1
converting	1
her	1
to	1
Catholicism,	1
to	1
obtain	1
money	1
from	1
her	1
for	1
Jesuit	1
institutions	1
(as	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
received	1
indications)-before	1
parting	1
with	1
her	1
money	1
insisted	1
that	1
the	1
various	1
operations	1
necessary	1
to	1
free	1
her	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
should	1
be	1
performed.	1
In	1
her	1
view	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
every	1
religion	1
was	1
merely	1
to	1
preserve	1
certain	1
proprieties	1
while	1
affording	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
human	1
desires.	1
And	1
with	1
this	1
aim,	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
talks	1
with	1
her	1
Father	1
Confessor,	1
she	1
insisted	1
on	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question,	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
was	1
she	1
bound	1
by	1
her	1
marriage?	1
	1
They	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
by	1
a	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
scent	1
of	1
flowers	1
came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window.	1
Helene	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
white	1
dress,	1
transparent	1
over	1
her	1
shoulders	1
and	1
bosom.	1
The	1
abbe,	1
a	1
well-fed	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
plump,	1
clean-shaven	1
chin,	1
a	1
pleasant	1
firm	1
mouth,	1
and	1
white	1
hands	1
meekly	1
folded	1
on	1
his	1
knees,	1
sat	1
close	1
to	1
Helene	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
a	1
peaceful	1
look	1
of	1
delight	1
at	1
her	1
beauty,	1
occasionally	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
explained	1
his	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
Helene	1
with	1
an	1
uneasy	1
smile	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
his	1
plump,	1
clean-shaven,	1
blackish	1
cheeks	1
and	1
every	1
moment	1
expected	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
fresh	1
turn.	1
But	1
the	1
abbe,	1
though	1
he	1
evidently	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
his	1
companion,	1
was	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
mastery	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
The	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
Confessor's	1
arguments	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:	1
"Ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
import	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
undertaking,	1
you	1
made	1
a	1
vow	1
of	1
conjugal	1
fidelity	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
by	1
entering	1
the	1
married	1
state	1
without	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
religious	1
significance	1
of	1
marriage,	1
committed	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
sacrilege.	1
That	1
marriage	1
lacked	1
the	1
dual	1
significance	1
it	1
should	1
have	1
had.	1
Yet	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
your	1
vow	1
was	1
binding.	1
You	1
swerved	1
from	1
it.	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
commit	1
by	1
so	1
acting?	1
A	1
venial,	1
or	1
a	1
mortal,	1
sin?	1
A	1
venial	1
sin,	1
for	1
you	1
acted	1
without	1
evil	1
intention.	1
If	1
now	1
you	1
married	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
bearing	1
children,	1
your	1
sin	1
might	1
be	1
forgiven.	1
But	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
again	1
a	1
twofold	1
one:	1
firstly..."	1
	1
But	1
suddenly	1
Helene,	1
who	1
was	1
getting	1
bored,	1
said	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
bewitching	1
smiles:	1
"But	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
having	1
espoused	1
the	1
true	1
religion	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
bound	1
by	1
what	1
a	1
false	1
religion	1
laid	1
upon	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
director	1
of	1
her	1
conscience	1
was	1
astounded	1
at	1
having	1
the	1
case	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
thus	1
with	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
Columbus'	1
egg.	1
He	1
was	1
delighted	1
at	1
the	1
unexpected	1
rapidity	1
of	1
his	1
pupil's	1
progress,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
abandon	1
the	1
edifice	1
of	1
argument	1
he	1
had	1
laboriously	1
constructed.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
understand	1
one	1
another,	1
Countess,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
began	1
refuting	1
his	1
spiritual	1
daughter's	1
arguments.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Helene	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
from	1
the	1
ecclesiastical	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
directors	1
were	1
making	1
difficulties	1
only	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
apprehensive	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
would	1
be	1
regarded	1
by	1
the	1
secular	1
authorities.	1
	1
So	1
she	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
prepare	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
society.	1
She	1
provoked	1
the	1
jealousy	1
of	1
the	1
elderly	1
magnate	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
other	1
suitor;	1
that	1
is,	1
she	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
right	1
over	1
her	1
was	1
to	1
marry	1
her.	1
The	1
elderly	1
magnate	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
as	1
much	1
taken	1
aback	1
by	1
this	1
suggestion	1
of	1
marriage	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
whose	1
husband	1
was	1
alive,	1
as	1
the	1
younger	1
man	1
had	1
been,	1
but	1
Helene's	1
imperturbable	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
as	1
marrying	1
a	1
maiden	1
had	1
its	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
too.	1
Had	1
Helene	1
herself	1
shown	1
the	1
least	1
sign	1
of	1
hesitation,	1
shame,	1
or	1
secrecy,	1
her	1
cause	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
been	1
lost;	1
but	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
she	1
show	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
secrecy	1
or	1
shame,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
with	1
good-natured	1
naivete	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
intimate	1
friends	1
(and	1
these	1
were	1
all	1
Petersburg)	1
that	1
both	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
the	1
magnate	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
both	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
grieving	1
either.	1
	1
A	1
rumor	1
immediately	1
spread	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
not	1
that	1
Helene	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
divorced	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
(had	1
such	1
a	1
report	1
spread	1
many	1
would	1
have	1
opposed	1
so	1
illegal	1
an	1
intention)	1
but	1
simply	1
that	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
interesting	1
Helene	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
she	1
should	1
marry.	1
The	1
question	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
whether	1
this	1
was	1
possible,	1
but	1
only	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
better	1
match	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
would	1
be	1
regarded	1
at	1
court.	1
There	1
were,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
some	1
rigid	1
individuals	1
unable	1
to	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
question,	1
who	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
project	1
a	1
desecration	1
of	1
the	1
sacrament	1
of	1
marriage,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
such	1
and	1
they	1
remained	1
silent,	1
while	1
the	1
majority	1
were	1
interested	1
in	1
Helene's	1
good	1
fortune	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
match	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
advantageous.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
to	1
remarry	1
while	1
one	1
had	1
a	1
husband	1
living	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
discuss,	1
for	1
that	1
question	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
settled	1
by	1
people	1
"wiser	1
than	1
you	1
or	1
me,"	1
as	1
they	1
said,	1
and	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
correctness	1
of	1
that	1
decision	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
risk	1
exposing	1
one's	1
stupidity	1
and	1
incapacity	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
Only	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
Akhrosimova,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
that	1
summer	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sons,	1
allowed	1
herself	1
plainly	1
to	1
express	1
an	1
opinion	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
one.	1
Meeting	1
Helene	1
at	1
a	1
ball	1
she	1
stopped	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and,	1
amid	1
general	1
silence,	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
gruff	1
voice:	1
"So	1
wives	1
of	1
living	1
men	1
have	1
started	1
marrying	1
again!	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
have	1
invented	1
a	1
novelty?	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
forestalled,	1
my	1
dear!	1
It	1
was	1
thought	1
of	1
long	1
ago.	1
It	1
is	1
done	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
brothels,"	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
turning	1
up	1
her	1
wide	1
sleeves	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
threatening	1
gesture	1
and	1
glancing	1
sternly	1
round,	1
moved	1
across	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Though	1
people	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
she	1
was	1
regarded	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
as	1
a	1
buffoon,	1
and	1
so	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
they	1
only	1
noticed,	1
and	1
repeated	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
the	1
one	1
coarse	1
word	1
she	1
had	1
used,	1
supposing	1
the	1
whole	1
sting	1
of	1
her	1
remark	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
that	1
word.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
of	1
late	1
very	1
often	1
forgot	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
repeated	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
a	1
hundred	1
times,	1
remarked	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
whenever	1
he	1
chanced	1
to	1
see	1
her:	1
	1
"Helene,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you,"	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
lead	1
her	1
aside,	1
drawing	1
her	1
hand	1
downward.	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
certain	1
projects	1
concerning...	1
you	1
know.	1
Well	1
my	1
dear	1
child,	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
your	1
father's	1
heart	1
rejoices	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
you...	1
You	1
have	1
suffered	1
so	1
much....	1
But,	1
my	1
dear	1
child,	1
consult	1
only	1
your	1
own	1
heart.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say,"	1
and	1
concealing	1
his	1
unvarying	1
emotion	1
he	1
would	1
press	1
his	1
cheek	1
against	1
his	1
daughter's	1
and	1
move	1
away.	1
	1
Bilibin,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
his	1
reputation	1
of	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
clever	1
man,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
disinterested	1
friends	1
so	1
brilliant	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
Helene	1
always	1
has--men	1
friends	1
who	1
can	1
never	1
change	1
into	1
lovers--once	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
intimate	1
gathering.	1
	1
"Listen,	1
Bilibin,"	1
said	1
Helene	1
(she	1
always	1
called	1
friends	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
by	1
their	1
surnames),	1
and	1
she	1
touched	1
his	1
coat	1
sleeve	1
with	1
her	1
white,	1
beringed	1
fingers.	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
as	1
you	1
would	1
a	1
sister,	1
what	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do.	1
Which	1
of	1
the	1
two?"	1
	1
Bilibin	1
wrinkled	1
up	1
the	1
skin	1
over	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
pondered,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
taking	1
me	1
unawares,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"As	1
a	1
true	1
friend,	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
and	1
thought	1
again	1
about	1
your	1
affair.	1
You	1
see,	1
if	1
you	1
marry	1
the	1
prince"--he	1
meant	1
the	1
younger	1
man--and	1
he	1
crooked	1
one	1
finger,	1
"you	1
forever	1
lose	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
marrying	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
displease	1
the	1
court	1
besides.	1
(You	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
connection.)	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
marry	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
his	1
last	1
days	1
happy,	1
and	1
as	1
widow	1
of	1
the	1
Grand...	1
the	1
prince	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
making	1
a	1
mesalliance	1
by	1
marrying	1
you,"	1
and	1
Bilibin	1
smoothed	1
out	1
his	1
forehead.	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
true	1
friend!"	1
said	1
Helene	1
beaming,	1
and	1
again	1
touching	1
Bilibin's	1
sleeve.	1
"But	1
I	1
love	1
them,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
distress	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
them	1
both."	1
	1
Bilibin	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
not	1
even	1
he	1
could	1
help	1
in	1
that	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"Une	1
maitresse-femme!	1
*	1
That's	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
putting	1
things	1
squarely.	1
She	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
all	1
three	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
	1
*	1
A	1
masterly	1
woman.	1
	1
"But	1
tell	1
me,	1
how	1
will	1
your	1
husband	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
matter?"	1
Bilibin	1
asked,	1
his	1
reputation	1
being	1
so	1
well	1
established	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
fear	1
to	1
ask	1
so	1
naive	1
a	1
question.	1
"Will	1
he	1
agree?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
so!"	1
said	1
Helene,	1
who	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
imagined	1
that	1
Pierre	1
too	1
loved	1
her.	1
"He	1
will	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
Bilibin	1
puckered	1
his	1
skin	1
in	1
preparation	1
for	1
something	1
witty.	1
	1
"Even	1
divorce	1
you?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Helene	1
laughed.	1
	1
Among	1
those	1
who	1
ventured	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
justifiability	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
marriage	1
was	1
Helene's	1
mother,	1
Princess	1
Kuragina.	1
She	1
was	1
continually	1
tormented	1
by	1
jealousy	1
of	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
jealousy	1
concerned	1
a	1
subject	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
heart,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
reconcile	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
idea.	1
She	1
consulted	1
a	1
Russian	1
priest	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
divorce	1
and	1
remarriage	1
during	1
a	1
husband's	1
lifetime,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
delight	1
showed	1
her	1
a	1
text	1
in	1
the	1
Gospel	1
which	1
(as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him)	1
plainly	1
forbids	1
remarriage	1
while	1
the	1
husband	1
is	1
alive.	1
	1
Armed	1
with	1
these	1
arguments,	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
unanswerable,	1
she	1
drove	1
to	1
her	1
daughter's	1
early	1
one	1
morning	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
alone.	1
	1
Having	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
objections,	1
Helene	1
smiled	1
blandly	1
and	1
ironically.	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
says	1
plainly:	1
'Whosoever	1
shall	1
marry	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
divorced...'"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
princess.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Maman,	1
ne	1
dites	1
pas	1
de	1
betises.	1
Vous	1
ne	1
comprenez	1
rien.	1
Dans	1
ma	1
position	1
j'ai	1
des	1
devoirs,"	1
*	1
said	1
Helene	1
changing	1
from	1
Russian,	1
in	1
which	1
language	1
she	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
her	1
case	1
did	1
not	1
sound	1
quite	1
clear,	1
into	1
French	1
which	1
suited	1
it	1
better.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Oh,	1
Mamma,	1
don't	1
talk	1
nonsense!	1
You	1
don't	1
understand	1
anything.	1
In	1
my	1
position	1
I	1
have	1
obligations."	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear...."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Mamma,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don't	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Father,	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
grant	1
dispensations..."	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
the	1
lady	1
companion	1
who	1
lived	1
with	1
Helene	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
His	1
Highness	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
	1
"Non,	1
dites-lui	1
que	1
je	1
ne	1
veux	1
pas	1
le	1
voir,	1
que	1
je	1
suis	1
furieuse	1
contre	1
lui,	1
parce	1
qu'il	1
m'a	1
manque	1
parole."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"No,	1
tell	1
him	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
furious	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
keeping	1
his	1
word	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Comtesse,	1
a	1
tout	1
peche	1
misericorde,"	1
*	1
said	1
a	1
fair-haired	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
face	1
and	1
nose,	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Countess,	1
there	1
is	1
mercy	1
for	1
every	1
sin."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
princess	1
rose	1
respectfully	1
and	1
curtsied.	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
her.	1
The	1
princess	1
nodded	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
sidled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
she	1
is	1
right,"	1
thought	1
the	1
old	1
princess,	1
all	1
her	1
convictions	1
dissipated	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
His	1
Highness.	1
"She	1
is	1
right,	1
but	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
in	1
our	1
irrecoverable	1
youth	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it?	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
simple,"	1
she	1
thought	1
as	1
she	1
got	1
into	1
her	1
carriage.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
August	1
Helene's	1
affairs	1
were	1
clearly	1
defined	1
and	1
she	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
her	1
husband--who,	1
as	1
she	1
imagined,	1
loved	1
her	1
very	1
much--informing	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
intention	1
to	1
marry	1
N.N.	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
embraced	1
the	1
one	1
true	1
faith,	1
and	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
formalities	1
necessary	1
for	1
a	1
divorce,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
bearer	1
of	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
to	1
have	1
you,	1
my	1
friend,	1
in	1
His	1
holy	1
and	1
powerful	1
keeping--Your	1
friend	1
Helene.	1
	1
This	1
letter	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
house	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
Toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
run	1
down	1
from	1
Raevski's	1
battery	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
a	1
gully	1
to	1
Knyazkovo	1
with	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
reached	1
the	1
dressing	1
station,	1
and	1
seeing	1
blood	1
and	1
hearing	1
cries	1
and	1
groans	1
hurried	1
on,	1
still	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
crowds	1
of	1
soldiers.	1
	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
now	1
desired	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
quickly	1
from	1
the	1
terrible	1
sensations	1
amid	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
sleep	1
quietly	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
bed.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
would	1
he	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
understand	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
felt.	1
But	1
such	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
were	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
Though	1
shells	1
and	1
bullets	1
did	1
not	1
whistle	1
over	1
the	1
road	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
still	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
there	1
was	1
what	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle.	1
There	1
were	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
suffering,	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
strangely	1
indifferent	1
faces,	1
the	1
same	1
blood,	1
the	1
same	1
soldiers'	1
overcoats,	1
the	1
same	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing	1
which,	1
though	1
distant	1
now,	1
still	1
aroused	1
terror,	1
and	1
besides	1
this	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
foul	1
air	1
and	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
Having	1
gone	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
miles	1
along	1
the	1
Mozhaysk	1
road,	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
roadside.	1
	1
Dusk	1
had	1
fallen,	1
and	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
guns	1
died	1
away.	1
Pierre	1
lay	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
shadows	1
that	1
moved	1
past	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
He	1
was	1
continually	1
imagining	1
that	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
was	1
flying	1
toward	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
terrific	1
whizz,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
shuddered	1
and	1
sat	1
up.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
how	1
long	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
there.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
three	1
soldiers,	1
having	1
brought	1
some	1
firewood,	1
settled	1
down	1
near	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
lighting	1
a	1
fire.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
threw	1
sidelong	1
glances	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
got	1
the	1
fire	1
to	1
burn	1
and	1
placed	1
an	1
iron	1
pot	1
on	1
it	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
broke	1
some	1
dried	1
bread	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
little	1
dripping.	1
The	1
pleasant	1
odor	1
of	1
greasy	1
viands	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
smoke.	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
sighed.	1
The	1
three	1
soldiers	1
were	1
eating	1
and	1
talking	1
among	1
themselves,	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
may	1
you	1
be?"	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
suddenly	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
evidently	1
meaning	1
what	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
had	1
in	1
mind,	1
namely:	1
"If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
eat	1
we'll	1
give	1
you	1
some	1
food,	1
only	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
whether	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
honest	1
man."	1
	1
"I,	1
I..."	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
feeling	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
minimize	1
his	1
social	1
position	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
better	1
understood	1
by	1
them.	1
"By	1
rights	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
militia	1
officer,	1
but	1
my	1
men	1
are	1
not	1
here.	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
have	1
lost	1
them."	1
	1
"There	1
now!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
	1
Another	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Would	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
mash?"	1
the	1
first	1
soldier	1
asked,	1
and	1
handed	1
Pierre	1
a	1
wooden	1
spoon	1
after	1
licking	1
it	1
clean.	1
	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
began	1
eating	1
the	1
mash,	1
as	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
cauldron,	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
more	1
delicious	1
than	1
any	1
food	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
tasted.	1
As	1
he	1
sat	1
bending	1
greedily	1
over	1
it,	1
helping	1
himself	1
to	1
large	1
spoonfuls	1
and	1
chewing	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"Where	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
to?	1
Tell	1
us!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
"To	1
Mozhaysk."	1
	1
"You're	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
aren't	1
you?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"And	1
what's	1
your	1
name?"	1
	1
"Peter	1
Kirilych."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
Peter	1
Kirilych,	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
us,	1
we'll	1
take	1
you	1
there."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
total	1
darkness	1
the	1
soldiers	1
walked	1
with	1
Pierre	1
to	1
Mozhaysk.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
got	1
near	1
Mozhaysk	1
and	1
began	1
ascending	1
the	1
steep	1
hill	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
the	1
cocks	1
were	1
already	1
crowing.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
that	1
his	1
inn	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
passed	1
it.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
soon	1
have	1
remembered	1
this,	1
such	1
was	1
his	1
state	1
of	1
forgetfulness,	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
halfway	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
stumbled	1
upon	1
his	1
groom,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
was	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
inn.	1
The	1
groom	1
recognized	1
Pierre	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
by	1
his	1
white	1
hat.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Why,	1
we	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
despair!	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
on	1
foot?	1
And	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going,	1
please?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
stopped.	1
	1
"So	1
you've	1
found	1
your	1
folk?"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
Peter	1
Kirilych--isn't	1
it?"	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
Peter	1
Kirilych!"	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
the	1
other	1
voices	1
repeat.	1
	1
"Good-bye!"	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
turned	1
with	1
his	1
groom	1
toward	1
the	1
inn.	1
	1
"I	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
something!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"No,	1
better	1
not!"	1
said	1
another,	1
inner	1
voice.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
room	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
inn,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
occupied.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
and,	1
covering	1
himself	1
up	1
head	1
and	1
all,	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
carriage.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
Pierre	1
laid	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
pillow	1
before	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
falling	1
asleep,	1
but	1
suddenly,	1
almost	1
with	1
the	1
distinctness	1
of	1
reality,	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
boom,	1
boom,	1
boom	1
of	1
firing,	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
projectiles,	1
groans	1
and	1
cries,	1
and	1
smelled	1
blood	1
and	1
powder,	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
dread	1
of	1
death	1
seized	1
him.	1
Filled	1
with	1
fright	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
cloak.	1
All	1
was	1
tranquil	1
in	1
the	1
yard.	1
Only	1
someone's	1
orderly	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
gateway,	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud,	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
innkeeper.	1
Above	1
Pierre's	1
head	1
some	1
pigeons,	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
movement	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
sitting	1
up,	1
fluttered	1
under	1
the	1
dark	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
penthouse.	1
The	1
whole	1
courtyard	1
was	1
permeated	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
peaceful	1
smell	1
of	1
stable	1
yards,	1
delightful	1
to	1
Pierre	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
clear	1
starry	1
sky	1
between	1
the	1
dark	1
roofs	1
of	1
two	1
penthouses.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
that!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
covering	1
up	1
his	1
head	1
again.	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
is	1
fear,	1
and	1
how	1
shamefully	1
I	1
yielded	1
to	1
it!	1
But	1
they...	1
they	1
were	1
steady	1
and	1
calm	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
to	1
the	1
end..."	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
They,	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
mind,	1
were	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
battery,	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
food,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
prayed	1
before	1
the	1
icon.	1
They,	1
those	1
strange	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
previously	1
known,	1
stood	1
out	1
clearly	1
and	1
sharply	1
from	1
everyone	1
else.	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
a	1
soldier,	1
just	1
a	1
soldier!"	1
thought	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
"to	1
enter	1
communal	1
life	1
completely,	1
to	1
be	1
imbued	1
by	1
what	1
makes	1
them	1
what	1
they	1
are.	1
But	1
how	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
superfluous,	1
devilish	1
burden	1
of	1
my	1
outer	1
man?	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
it.	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
my	1
father,	1
as	1
I	1
wanted	1
to.	1
Or	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
soldier	1
after	1
the	1
duel	1
with	1
Dolokhov."	1
And	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
challenged	1
Dolokhov	1
flashed	1
through	1
Pierre's	1
mind,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
benefactor	1
at	1
Torzhok.	1
And	1
now	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
solemn	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
lodge	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
mind.	1
It	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
and	1
someone	1
near	1
and	1
dear	1
to	1
him	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
he!	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
benefactor.	1
But	1
he	1
died!"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
died,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
alive.	1
How	1
sorry	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
he	1
died,	1
and	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
alive	1
again!"	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
sat	1
Anatole,	1
Dolokhov,	1
Nesvitski,	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
others	1
like	1
them	1
(in	1
his	1
dream	1
the	1
category	1
to	1
which	1
these	1
men	1
belonged	1
was	1
as	1
clearly	1
defined	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
the	1
category	1
of	1
those	1
he	1
termed	1
they),	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
those	1
people,	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Dolokhov,	1
shouting	1
and	1
singing	1
loudly;	1
yet	1
through	1
their	1
shouting	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
benefactor	1
was	1
heard	1
speaking	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
was	1
as	1
weighty	1
and	1
uninterrupted	1
as	1
the	1
booming	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield,	1
but	1
pleasant	1
and	1
comforting.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
his	1
benefactor	1
was	1
saying,	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
(the	1
categories	1
of	1
thoughts	1
were	1
also	1
quite	1
distinct	1
in	1
his	1
dream)	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
goodness	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
being	1
what	1
they	1
were.	1
And	1
they	1
with	1
their	1
simple,	1
kind,	1
firm	1
faces	1
surrounded	1
his	1
benefactor	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
But	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
kindly	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
Wishing	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
to	1
attract	1
their	1
attention,	1
he	1
got	1
up,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
his	1
legs	1
grew	1
cold	1
and	1
bare.	1
	1
He	1
felt	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
arm	1
covered	1
his	1
legs	1
from	1
which	1
his	1
cloak	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
slipped.	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
rearranging	1
his	1
cloak	1
Pierre	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
same	1
penthouse	1
roofs,	1
posts,	1
and	1
yard,	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
bluish,	1
lit	1
up,	1
and	1
glittering	1
with	1
frost	1
or	1
dew.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
dawn,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"But	1
that's	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
want.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
understand	1
my	1
benefactor's	1
words."	1
Again	1
he	1
covered	1
himself	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
cloak,	1
but	1
now	1
neither	1
the	1
lodge	1
nor	1
his	1
benefactor	1
was	1
there.	1
There	1
were	1
only	1
thoughts	1
clearly	1
expressed	1
in	1
words,	1
thoughts	1
that	1
someone	1
was	1
uttering	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
formulating.	1
	1
Afterwards	1
when	1
he	1
recalled	1
those	1
thoughts	1
Pierre	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
someone	1
outside	1
himself	1
had	1
spoken	1
them,	1
though	1
the	1
impressions	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
had	1
evoked	1
them.	1
He	1
had	1
never,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
express	1
his	1
thoughts	1
like	1
that	1
when	1
awake.	1
	1
"To	1
endure	1
war	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
subordination	1
of	1
man's	1
freedom	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God,"	1
the	1
voice	1
had	1
said.	1
"Simplicity	1
is	1
submission	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God;	1
you	1
cannot	1
escape	1
from	1
Him.	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
simple.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
talk,	1
but	1
act.	1
The	1
spoken	1
word	1
is	1
silver	1
but	1
the	1
unspoken	1
is	1
golden.	1
Man	1
can	1
be	1
master	1
of	1
nothing	1
while	1
he	1
fears	1
death,	1
but	1
he	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
fear	1
it	1
possesses	1
all.	1
If	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
suffering,	1
man	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
his	1
limitations,	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
himself.	1
The	1
hardest	1
thing	1
(Pierre	1
went	1
on	1
thinking,	1
or	1
hearing,	1
in	1
his	1
dream)	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
in	1
your	1
soul	1
to	1
unite	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all.	1
To	1
unite	1
all?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself.	1
"No,	1
not	1
to	1
unite.	1
Thoughts	1
cannot	1
be	1
united,	1
but	1
to	1
harness	1
all	1
these	1
thoughts	1
together	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
need!	1
Yes,	1
one	1
must	1
harness	1
them,	1
must	1
harness	1
them!"	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself	1
with	1
inward	1
rapture,	1
feeling	1
that	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
they	1
alone	1
expressed	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
solved	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
tormented	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
one	1
must	1
harness,	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
harness."	1
	1
"Time	1
to	1
harness,	1
time	1
to	1
harness,	1
your	1
excellency!	1
Your	1
excellency!"	1
some	1
voice	1
was	1
repeating.	1
"We	1
must	1
harness,	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
harness...."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
groom,	1
trying	1
to	1
wake	1
him.	1
The	1
sun	1
shone	1
straight	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
face.	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
dirty	1
innyard	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
which	1
soldiers	1
were	1
watering	1
their	1
lean	1
horses	1
at	1
the	1
pump	1
while	1
carts	1
were	1
passing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate.	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
repugnance,	1
and	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
quickly	1
fell	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
carriage	1
seat.	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
that,	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
understand	1
that.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
revealing	1
itself	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
dream.	1
One	1
second	1
more	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
understood	1
it	1
all!	1
But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?	1
Harness,	1
but	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
harness	1
everything?"	1
and	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
with	1
horror	1
that	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
thought	1
in	1
the	1
dream	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed.	1
	1
The	1
groom,	1
the	1
coachman,	1
and	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
told	1
Pierre	1
that	1
an	1
officer	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
already	1
near	1
Mozhaysk	1
and	1
that	1
our	1
men	1
were	1
leaving	1
it.	1
	1
Pierre	1
got	1
up	1
and,	1
having	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
harness	1
and	1
overtake	1
him,	1
went	1
on	1
foot	1
through	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
The	1
troops	1
were	1
moving	1
on,	1
leaving	1
about	1
ten	1
thousand	1
wounded	1
behind	1
them.	1
There	1
were	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
yards,	1
at	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
and	1
the	1
streets	1
were	1
crowded	1
with	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
streets,	1
around	1
carts	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
away,	1
shouts,	1
curses,	1
and	1
blows	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Pierre	1
offered	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
carriage,	1
which	1
had	1
overtaken	1
him,	1
to	1
a	1
wounded	1
general	1
he	1
knew,	1
and	1
drove	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
Pierre	1
was	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
brother-in-law	1
Anatole	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
On	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
of	1
August	1
Pierre	1
reached	1
Moscow.	1
Close	1
to	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
for	1
you	1
everywhere,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"The	1
count	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
particularly.	1
He	1
asks	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
matter."	1
	1
Without	1
going	1
home,	1
Pierre	1
took	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Moscow	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
only	1
that	1
morning	1
returned	1
to	1
town	1
from	1
his	1
summer	1
villa	1
at	1
Sokolniki.	1
The	1
anteroom	1
and	1
reception	1
room	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
officials	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
summoned	1
or	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
orders.	1
Vasilchikov	1
and	1
Platov	1
had	1
already	1
seen	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
defend	1
Moscow	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
surrendered.	1
Though	1
this	1
news	1
was	1
being	1
concealed	1
from	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
the	1
officials--the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
government	1
departments--knew	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
enemy's	1
hands,	1
just	1
as	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
himself	1
knew	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
escape	1
personal	1
responsibility	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
governor	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
their	1
various	1
departments.	1
	1
As	1
Pierre	1
was	1
entering	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
a	1
courier	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Rostopchin's	1
private	1
room.	1
	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
questions	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
greeted,	1
the	1
courier	1
made	1
a	1
despairing	1
gesture	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
While	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
Pierre	1
with	1
weary	1
eyes	1
watched	1
the	1
various	1
officials,	1
old	1
and	1
young,	1
military	1
and	1
civilian,	1
who	1
were	1
there.	1
They	1
all	1
seemed	1
dissatisfied	1
and	1
uneasy.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
men,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
knew.	1
After	1
greeting	1
Pierre	1
they	1
continued	1
their	1
conversation.	1
	1
"If	1
they're	1
sent	1
out	1
and	1
brought	1
back	1
again	1
later	1
on	1
it	1
will	1
do	1
no	1
harm,	1
but	1
as	1
things	1
are	1
now	1
one	1
can't	1
answer	1
for	1
anything."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
writes..."	1
said	1
another,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
printed	1
sheet	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"That's	1
another	1
matter.	1
That's	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
people,"	1
said	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
a	1
fresh	1
broadsheet."	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
it	1
and	1
began	1
reading.	1
	1
His	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
has	1
passed	1
through	1
Mozhaysk	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
join	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
moving	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
has	1
taken	1
up	1
a	1
strong	1
position	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
will	1
not	1
soon	1
attack	1
him.	1
Forty	1
eight	1
guns	1
with	1
ammunition	1
have	1
been	1
sent	1
him	1
from	1
here,	1
and	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
says	1
he	1
will	1
defend	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
drop	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
is	1
even	1
ready	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
Do	1
not	1
be	1
upset,	1
brothers,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
courts	1
are	1
closed;	1
things	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
order,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
deal	1
with	1
villains	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
way!	1
When	1
the	1
time	1
comes	1
I	1
shall	1
want	1
both	1
town	1
and	1
peasant	1
lads	1
and	1
will	1
raise	1
the	1
cry	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
beforehand,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
wanted	1
yet	1
so	1
I	1
hold	1
my	1
peace.	1
An	1
ax	1
will	1
be	1
useful,	1
a	1
hunting	1
spear	1
not	1
bad,	1
but	1
a	1
three-pronged	1
fork	1
will	1
be	1
best	1
of	1
all:	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
is	1
no	1
heavier	1
than	1
a	1
sheaf	1
of	1
rye.	1
Tomorrow	1
after	1
dinner	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
Iberian	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Mother	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
the	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
Catherine	1
Hospital	1
where	1
we	1
will	1
have	1
some	1
water	1
blessed.	1
That	1
will	1
help	1
them	1
to	1
get	1
well	1
quicker.	1
I,	1
too,	1
am	1
well	1
now:	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
eyes	1
was	1
sore	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
with	1
both.	1
	1
"But	1
military	1
men	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
the	1
town,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
"and	1
that	1
the	1
position..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course!	1
That's	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
saying,"	1
replied	1
the	1
first	1
speaker.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
mean	1
by	1
'One	1
of	1
my	1
eyes	1
was	1
sore	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
with	1
both'?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"The	1
count	1
had	1
a	1
sty,"	1
replied	1
the	1
adjutant	1
smiling,	1
"and	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
upset	1
when	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
people	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him.	1
By	1
the	1
by,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
added	1
suddenly,	1
addressing	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"we	1
heard	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
family	1
troubles	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
countess,	1
your	1
wife..."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
nothing,"	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
unconcernedly.	1
"But	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
heard?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
well,	1
you	1
know	1
people	1
often	1
invent	1
things.	1
I	1
only	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
heard."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
hear?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
they	1
say,"	1
continued	1
the	1
adjutant	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile,	1
"that	1
the	1
countess,	1
your	1
wife,	1
is	1
preparing	1
to	1
go	1
abroad.	1
I	1
expect	1
it's	1
nonsense...."	1
	1
"Possibly,"	1
remarked	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
absent-mindedly.	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
that?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
indicating	1
a	1
short	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
blue	1
peasant	1
overcoat,	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
snow-white	1
beard	1
and	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
a	1
ruddy	1
face.	1
	1
"He?	1
That's	1
a	1
tradesman,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
he's	1
the	1
restaurant	1
keeper,	1
Vereshchagin.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
that	1
affair	1
with	1
the	1
proclamation."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
so	1
that	1
is	1
Vereshchagin!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
firm,	1
calm	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
seeking	1
any	1
indication	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
traitor.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
he	1
himself,	1
that's	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
fellow	1
who	1
wrote	1
the	1
proclamation,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"The	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
in	1
prison	1
and	1
I	1
expect	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
hard	1
with	1
him."	1
	1
An	1
old	1
gentleman	1
wearing	1
a	1
star	1
and	1
another	1
official,	1
a	1
German	1
wearing	1
a	1
cross	1
round	1
his	1
neck,	1
approached	1
the	1
speaker.	1
	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
complicated	1
story,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"That	1
proclamation	1
appeared	1
about	1
two	1
months	1
ago.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
informed	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
matter.	1
Gabriel	1
Ivanovich	1
here	1
made	1
the	1
inquiries.	1
The	1
proclamation	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
exactly	1
sixty-	1
three	1
hands.	1
He	1
asked	1
one,	1
'From	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
it?'	1
'From	1
so-and-so.'	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
one.	1
'From	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
it?'	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
till	1
he	1
reached	1
Vereshchagin,	1
a	1
half	1
educated	1
tradesman,	1
you	1
know,	1
'a	1
pet	1
of	1
a	1
trader,'"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant	1
smiling.	1
"They	1
asked	1
him,	1
'Who	1
gave	1
it	1
you?'	1
And	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
knew	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
it	1
from.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
had	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
Postmaster.	1
But	1
evidently	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
some	1
understanding.	1
He	1
replied:	1
'From	1
no	1
one;	1
I	1
made	1
it	1
up	1
myself.'	1
They	1
threatened	1
and	1
questioned	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
stuck	1
to	1
that:	1
'I	1
made	1
it	1
up	1
myself.'	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
reported	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
man.	1
'From	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
the	1
proclamation?'	1
'I	1
wrote	1
it	1
myself.'	1
Well,	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
count,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant	1
cheerfully,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pride,	1
"he	1
flared	1
up	1
dreadfully--and	1
just	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
fellow's	1
audacity,	1
lying,	1
and	1
obstinacy!"	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
count	1
wanted	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
Klyucharev?	1
I	1
understand!"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,"	1
rejoined	1
the	1
adjutant	1
in	1
dismay.	1
"Klyucharev	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
sins	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
without	1
that	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
banished.	1
But	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
much	1
annoyed.	1
'How	1
could	1
you	1
have	1
written	1
it	1
yourself?'	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
Hamburg	1
Gazette	1
that	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
'Here	1
it	1
is!	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
write	1
it	1
yourself	1
but	1
translated	1
it,	1
and	1
translated	1
it	1
abominably,	1
because	1
you	1
don't	1
even	1
know	1
French,	1
you	1
fool.'	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
'No,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'I	1
have	1
not	1
read	1
any	1
papers,	1
I	1
made	1
it	1
up	1
myself.'	1
'If	1
that's	1
so,	1
you're	1
a	1
traitor	1
and	1
I'll	1
have	1
you	1
tried,	1
and	1
you'll	1
be	1
hanged!	1
Say	1
from	1
whom	1
you	1
had	1
it.'	1
'I	1
have	1
seen	1
no	1
papers,	1
I	1
made	1
it	1
up	1
myself.'	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
the	1
father	1
fetched,	1
but	1
the	1
fellow	1
stuck	1
to	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
trial	1
and	1
condemned	1
to	1
hard	1
labor,	1
I	1
believe.	1
Now	1
the	1
father	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
intercede	1
for	1
him.	1
But	1
he's	1
a	1
good-for-nothing	1
lad!	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
tradesman's	1
son,	1
a	1
dandy	1
and	1
lady-killer.	1
He	1
attended	1
some	1
lectures	1
somewhere	1
and	1
imagines	1
that	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
no	1
match	1
for	1
him.	1
That's	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
fellow	1
he	1
is.	1
His	1
father	1
keeps	1
a	1
cookshop	1
here	1
by	1
the	1
Stone	1
Bridge,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
icon	1
of	1
God	1
Almighty	1
painted	1
with	1
a	1
scepter	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
an	1
orb	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
Well,	1
he	1
took	1
that	1
icon	1
home	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
do?	1
He	1
found	1
some	1
scoundrel	1
of	1
a	1
painter..."	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
fresh	1
tale	1
Pierre	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
private	1
room	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
puckering	1
his	1
face,	1
was	1
rubbing	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
A	1
short	1
man	1
was	1
saying	1
something,	1
but	1
when	1
Pierre	1
entered	1
he	1
stopped	1
speaking	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
great	1
warrior?"	1
said	1
Rostopchin	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
short	1
man	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
"We	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
prowess.	1
But	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
Between	1
ourselves,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
do	1
you	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Masons?"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
severely,	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
wrong	1
about	1
it	1
which	1
he	1
nevertheless	1
intended	1
to	1
pardon.	1
Pierre	1
remained	1
silent.	1
"I	1
am	1
well	1
informed,	1
my	1
friend,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
aware	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
Masons	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
on	1
pretense	1
of	1
saving	1
mankind	1
wish	1
to	1
ruin	1
Russia."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Mason,"	1
Pierre	1
replied.	1
	1
"There,	1
you	1
see,	1
mon	1
cher!	1
I	1
expect	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
Messrs.	1
Speranski	1
and	1
Magnitski	1
have	1
been	1
deported	1
to	1
their	1
proper	1
place.	1
Mr.	1
Klyucharev	1
has	1
been	1
treated	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
others	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
plea	1
of	1
building	1
up	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Solomon	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
their	1
fatherland.	1
You	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
reasons	1
for	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
exiled	1
the	1
Postmaster	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
harmful	1
person.	1
It	1
has	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
knowledge	1
that	1
you	1
lent	1
him	1
your	1
carriage	1
for	1
his	1
removal	1
from	1
town,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
even	1
accepted	1
papers	1
from	1
him	1
for	1
safe	1
custody.	1
I	1
like	1
you	1
and	1
don't	1
wish	1
you	1
any	1
harm	1
and--as	1
you	1
are	1
only	1
half	1
my	1
age--I	1
advise	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
father	1
would,	1
to	1
cease	1
all	1
communication	1
with	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
stamp	1
and	1
to	1
leave	1
here	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
did	1
Klyucharev	1
do	1
wrong,	1
Count?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
know,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
ask,"	1
shouted	1
Rostopchin.	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
accused	1
of	1
circulating	1
Napoleon's	1
proclamation	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
so,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Rostopchin,	1
"and	1
Vereshchagin..."	1
	1
"There	1
we	1
are!"	1
Rostopchin	1
shouted	1
at	1
Pierre	1
louder	1
than	1
before,	1
frowning	1
suddenly.	1
"Vereshchagin	1
is	1
a	1
renegade	1
and	1
a	1
traitor	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
punished	1
as	1
he	1
deserves,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
vindictive	1
heat	1
with	1
which	1
people	1
speak	1
when	1
recalling	1
an	1
insult.	1
"But	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
summon	1
you	1
to	1
discuss	1
my	1
actions,	1
but	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
advice--or	1
an	1
order	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
it.	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
break	1
off	1
all	1
communication	1
with	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
Klyucharev.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
knock	1
the	1
nonsense	1
out	1
of	1
anybody"--	1
but	1
probably	1
realizing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
shouting	1
at	1
Bezukhov	1
who	1
so	1
far	1
was	1
not	1
guilty	1
of	1
anything,	1
he	1
added,	1
taking	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
manner,	1
"We	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
a	1
public	1
disaster	1
and	1
I	1
haven't	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
polite	1
to	1
everybody	1
who	1
has	1
business	1
with	1
me.	1
My	1
head	1
is	1
sometimes	1
in	1
a	1
whirl.	1
Well,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
personally?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
nothing,"	1
answered	1
Pierre	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes	1
or	1
changing	1
the	1
thoughtful	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
frowned.	1
	1
"A	1
word	1
of	1
friendly	1
advice,	1
mon	1
cher.	1
Be	1
off	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
Happy	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
ears	1
to	1
hear.	1
Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
Oh,	1
by	1
the	1
by!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
through	1
the	1
doorway	1
after	1
Pierre,	1
"is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
countess	1
has	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
clutches	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Jesus?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
left	1
Rostopchin's	1
room	1
more	1
sullen	1
and	1
angry	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
before	1
shown	1
himself.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
home	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
getting	1
dark.	1
Some	1
eight	1
people	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
that	1
evening:	1
the	1
secretary	1
of	1
a	1
committee,	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
his	1
battalion,	1
his	1
steward,	1
his	1
major-domo,	1
and	1
various	1
petitioners.	1
They	1
all	1
had	1
business	1
with	1
Pierre	1
and	1
wanted	1
decisions	1
from	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
questions	1
and	1
only	1
answered	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
these	1
people.	1
When	1
left	1
alone	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
opened	1
and	1
read	1
his	1
wife's	1
letter.	1
	1
"They,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
at	1
the	1
battery,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
killed...	1
that	1
old	1
man...	1
Simplicity	1
is	1
submission	1
to	1
God.	1
Suffering	1
is	1
necessary...	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all...	1
one	1
must	1
harness...	1
my	1
wife	1
is	1
getting	1
married...	1
One	1
must	1
forget	1
and	1
understand..."	1
And	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
bed	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
it	1
without	1
undressing	1
and	1
immediately	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
awoke	1
next	1
morning	1
the	1
major-domo	1
came	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
special	1
messenger,	1
a	1
police	1
officer,	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
had	1
left	1
or	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
A	1
dozen	1
persons	1
who	1
had	1
business	1
with	1
Pierre	1
were	1
awaiting	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
dressed	1
hurriedly	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
porch	1
and	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
Bezukhov's	1
household,	1
despite	1
all	1
the	1
search	1
they	1
made,	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
again	1
or	1
knew	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
The	1
Rostovs	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
till	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
that	1
is,	1
till	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
entry	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
After	1
Petya	1
had	1
joined	1
Obolenski's	1
regiment	1
of	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
left	1
for	1
Belaya	1
Tserkov	1
where	1
that	1
regiment	1
was	1
forming,	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
terror.	1
The	1
thought	1
that	1
both	1
her	1
sons	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
war,	1
had	1
both	1
gone	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
wing,	1
that	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow	1
either	1
or	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
might	1
be	1
killed	1
like	1
the	1
three	1
sons	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintances,	1
struck	1
her	1
that	1
summer	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
with	1
cruel	1
clearness.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
Nicholas	1
back	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
herself	1
to	1
join	1
Petya,	1
or	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
an	1
appointment	1
somewhere	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
but	1
neither	1
of	1
these	1
proved	1
possible.	1
Petya	1
could	1
not	1
return	1
unless	1
his	1
regiment	1
did	1
so	1
or	1
unless	1
he	1
was	1
transferred	1
to	1
another	1
regiment	1
on	1
active	1
service.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
somewhere	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
sent	1
a	1
word	1
since	1
his	1
last	1
letter,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
detailed	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
meeting	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
The	1
countess	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
at	1
night,	1
or	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
fall	1
asleep	1
dreamed	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
sons	1
lying	1
dead.	1
After	1
many	1
consultations	1
and	1
conversations,	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
last	1
devised	1
means	1
to	1
tranquillize	1
her.	1
He	1
got	1
Petya	1
transferred	1
from	1
Obolenski's	1
regiment	1
to	1
Bezukhov's,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
training	1
near	1
Moscow.	1
Though	1
Petya	1
would	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
this	1
transfer	1
would	1
give	1
the	1
countess	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
seeing	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sons	1
under	1
her	1
wing,	1
and	1
she	1
hoped	1
to	1
arrange	1
matters	1
for	1
her	1
Petya	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
again,	1
but	1
always	1
get	1
him	1
appointed	1
to	1
places	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
battle.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
alone	1
was	1
in	1
danger	1
the	1
countess	1
imagined	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
her	1
first-born	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
her	1
other	1
children	1
and	1
even	1
reproached	1
herself	1
for	1
it;	1
but	1
when	1
her	1
youngest:	1
the	1
scapegrace	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
bad	1
at	1
lessons,	1
was	1
always	1
breaking	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
making	1
himself	1
a	1
nuisance	1
to	1
everybody,	1
that	1
snub-nosed	1
Petya	1
with	1
his	1
merry	1
black	1
eyes	1
and	1
fresh	1
rosy	1
cheeks	1
where	1
soft	1
down	1
was	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
show--when	1
he	1
was	1
thrown	1
amid	1
those	1
big,	1
dreadful,	1
cruel	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
fighting	1
somewhere	1
about	1
something	1
and	1
apparently	1
finding	1
pleasure	1
in	1
it--then	1
his	1
mother	1
thought	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
more,	1
much	1
more,	1
than	1
all	1
her	1
other	1
children.	1
The	1
nearer	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
for	1
Petya	1
to	1
return,	1
the	1
more	1
uneasy	1
grew	1
the	1
countess.	1
She	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
happiness.	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
of	1
her	1
beloved	1
Natasha,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
irritated	1
her.	1
"What	1
do	1
I	1
want	1
with	1
them?	1
I	1
want	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
Petya,"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
August	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
received	1
another	1
letter	1
from	1
Nicholas.	1
He	1
wrote	1
from	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Voronezh	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
procure	1
remounts,	1
but	1
that	1
letter	1
did	1
not	1
set	1
the	1
countess	1
at	1
ease.	1
Knowing	1
that	1
one	1
son	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
danger	1
she	1
became	1
the	1
more	1
anxious	1
about	1
Petya.	1
	1
Though	1
by	1
the	1
twentieth	1
of	1
August	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
acquaintances	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
though	1
everybody	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
countess	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
leaving	1
before	1
her	1
treasure,	1
her	1
adored	1
Petya,	1
returned.	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
of	1
August	1
he	1
arrived.	1
The	1
passionate	1
tenderness	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
mother	1
received	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
please	1
the	1
sixteen-year-old	1
officer.	1
Though	1
she	1
concealed	1
from	1
him	1
her	1
intention	1
of	1
keeping	1
him	1
under	1
her	1
wing,	1
Petya	1
guessed	1
her	1
designs,	1
and	1
instinctively	1
fearing	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
emotion	1
when	1
with	1
her--might	1
"become	1
womanish"	1
as	1
he	1
termed	1
it	1
to	1
himself--he	1
treated	1
her	1
coldly,	1
avoided	1
her,	1
and	1
during	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow	1
attached	1
himself	1
exclusively	1
to	1
Natasha	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
particularly	1
brotherly	1
tenderness,	1
almost	1
lover-like.	1
	1
Owing	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
customary	1
carelessness	1
nothing	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
their	1
departure	1
by	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
of	1
August	1
and	1
the	1
carts	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
their	1
Ryazan	1
and	1
Moscow	1
estates	1
to	1
remove	1
their	1
household	1
belongings	1
did	1
not	1
arrive	1
till	1
the	1
thirtieth.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
till	1
the	1
thirty-first	1
all	1
Moscow	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bustle	1
and	1
commotion.	1
Every	1
day	1
thousands	1
of	1
men	1
wounded	1
at	1
Borodino	1
were	1
brought	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
gate	1
and	1
taken	1
to	1
various	1
parts	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
thousands	1
of	1
carts	1
conveyed	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
and	1
their	1
possessions	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
gates.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
Rostopchin's	1
broadsheets,	1
or	1
because	1
of	1
them	1
or	1
independently	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
strangest	1
and	1
most	1
contradictory	1
rumors	1
were	1
current	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
Some	1
said	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
city,	1
others	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
icons	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
and	1
everybody	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
ordered	1
to	1
leave.	1
Some	1
said	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
another	1
battle	1
after	1
Borodino	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
been	1
routed,	1
while	1
others	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
reported	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed.	1
Some	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
Moscow	1
militia	1
which,	1
preceded	1
by	1
the	1
clergy,	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills;	1
others	1
whispered	1
that	1
Augustin	1
had	1
been	1
forbidden	1
to	1
leave,	1
that	1
traitors	1
had	1
been	1
seized,	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
rioting	1
and	1
robbing	1
people	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
talk;	1
in	1
reality	1
(though	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
Fili,	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
held)	1
both	1
those	1
who	1
went	1
away	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
remained	1
behind	1
felt,	1
though	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
it,	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
abandoned,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
save	1
their	1
belongings.	1
It	1
was	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
suddenly	1
break	1
up	1
and	1
change,	1
but	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September	1
nothing	1
had	1
done	1
so.	1
As	1
a	1
criminal	1
who	1
is	1
being	1
led	1
to	1
execution	1
knows	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
die	1
immediately,	1
but	1
yet	1
looks	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
straightens	1
the	1
cap	1
that	1
is	1
awry	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
so	1
Moscow	1
involuntarily	1
continued	1
its	1
wonted	1
life,	1
though	1
it	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
its	1
destruction	1
was	1
near	1
when	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
which	1
its	1
people	1
were	1
accustomed	1
to	1
submit	1
would	1
be	1
completely	1
upset.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
three	1
days	1
preceding	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
Moscow	1
the	1
whole	1
Rostov	1
family	1
was	1
absorbed	1
in	1
various	1
activities.	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
continually	1
drove	1
about	1
the	1
city	1
collecting	1
the	1
current	1
rumors	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
gave	1
superficial	1
and	1
hasty	1
orders	1
at	1
home	1
about	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
their	1
departure.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
watched	1
the	1
things	1
being	1
packed,	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
everything,	1
was	1
constantly	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
Petya	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
Natasha	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
spent	1
all	1
his	1
time.	1
Sonya	1
alone	1
directed	1
the	1
practical	1
side	1
of	1
matters	1
by	1
getting	1
things	1
packed.	1
But	1
of	1
late	1
Sonya	1
had	1
been	1
particularly	1
sad	1
and	1
silent.	1
Nicholas'	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
mentioned	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
elicited,	1
in	1
her	1
presence,	1
joyous	1
comments	1
from	1
the	1
countess,	1
who	1
saw	1
an	1
intervention	1
of	1
Providence	1
in	1
this	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
never	1
pleased	1
at	1
Bolkonski's	1
engagement	1
to	1
Natasha,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
"but	1
I	1
always	1
wanted	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
princess,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
presentiment	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
happen.	1
What	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
it	1
would	1
be!"	1
	1
Sonya	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
true:	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
possibility	1
of	1
retrieving	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
affairs	1
was	1
by	1
Nicholas	1
marrying	1
a	1
rich	1
woman,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
match.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
bitter	1
for	1
her.	1
But	1
despite	1
her	1
grief,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
just	1
because	1
of	1
it,	1
she	1
took	1
on	1
herself	1
all	1
the	1
difficult	1
work	1
of	1
directing	1
the	1
storing	1
and	1
packing	1
of	1
their	1
things	1
and	1
was	1
busy	1
for	1
whole	1
days.	1
The	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
any	1
orders	1
to	1
give.	1
Petya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
far	1
from	1
helping	1
their	1
parents,	1
were	1
generally	1
a	1
nuisance	1
and	1
a	1
hindrance	1
to	1
everyone.	1
Almost	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
the	1
house	1
resounded	1
with	1
their	1
running	1
feet,	1
their	1
cries,	1
and	1
their	1
spontaneous	1
laughter.	1
They	1
laughed	1
and	1
were	1
gay	1
not	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
laugh,	1
but	1
because	1
gaiety	1
and	1
mirth	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
so	1
everything	1
that	1
happened	1
was	1
a	1
cause	1
for	1
gaiety	1
and	1
laughter	1
to	1
them.	1
Petya	1
was	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
because	1
having	1
left	1
home	1
a	1
boy	1
he	1
had	1
returned	1
(as	1
everybody	1
told	1
him)	1
a	1
fine	1
young	1
man,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Belaya	1
Tserkov	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
soon	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
battle	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
fighting	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
and	1
chiefly	1
because	1
Natasha,	1
whose	1
lead	1
he	1
always	1
followed,	1
was	1
in	1
high	1
spirits.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
gay	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
sad	1
too	1
long	1
and	1
now	1
nothing	1
reminded	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
sadness,	1
and	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
feeling	1
well.	1
She	1
was	1
also	1
happy	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
someone	1
to	1
adore	1
her:	1
the	1
adoration	1
of	1
others	1
was	1
a	1
lubricant	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
her	1
machine	1
needed	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
run	1
freely--	1
and	1
Petya	1
adored	1
her.	1
Above	1
all,	1
they	1
were	1
gay	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
war	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
fighting	1
at	1
the	1
town	1
gates,	1
arms	1
were	1
being	1
given	1
out,	1
everybody	1
was	1
escaping--going	1
away	1
somewhere,	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
was	1
happening,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
always	1
exciting,	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
young.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
On	1
Saturday,	1
the	1
thirty-first	1
of	1
August,	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
seemed	1
topsy-turvy.	1
All	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
open,	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
out	1
or	1
moved	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
mirrors	1
and	1
pictures	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
down.	1
There	1
were	1
trunks	1
in	1
the	1
rooms,	1
and	1
hay,	1
wrapping	1
paper,	1
and	1
ropes	1
were	1
scattered	1
about.	1
The	1
peasants	1
and	1
house	1
serfs	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
things	1
were	1
treading	1
heavily	1
on	1
the	1
parquet	1
floors.	1
The	1
yard	1
was	1
crowded	1
with	1
peasant	1
carts,	1
some	1
loaded	1
high	1
and	1
already	1
corded	1
up,	1
others	1
still	1
empty.	1
	1
The	1
voices	1
and	1
footsteps	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
servants	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
carts	1
resounded	1
as	1
they	1
shouted	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
since	1
morning.	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
a	1
headache	1
brought	1
on	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
turmoil	1
and	1
was	1
lying	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
vinegar	1
compress	1
on	1
her	1
head.	1
Petya	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
home,	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
visit	1
a	1
friend	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
transfer	1
from	1
the	1
militia	1
to	1
the	1
active	1
army.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
looking	1
after	1
the	1
packing	1
of	1
the	1
glass	1
and	1
china.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
her	1
dismantled	1
room	1
with	1
dresses,	1
ribbons,	1
and	1
scarves	1
strewn	1
all	1
about	1
her,	1
gazing	1
fixedly	1
at	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
holding	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
the	1
old	1
ball	1
dress	1
(already	1
out	1
of	1
fashion)	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
at	1
her	1
first	1
Petersburg	1
ball.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
ashamed	1
of	1
doing	1
nothing	1
when	1
everyone	1
else	1
was	1
so	1
busy,	1
and	1
several	1
times	1
that	1
morning	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
set	1
to	1
work,	1
but	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
except	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
might.	1
For	1
a	1
while	1
she	1
had	1
stood	1
beside	1
Sonya	1
while	1
the	1
china	1
was	1
being	1
packed	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
help,	1
but	1
soon	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
to	1
pack	1
her	1
own	1
things.	1
At	1
first	1
she	1
found	1
it	1
amusing	1
to	1
give	1
away	1
dresses	1
and	1
ribbons	1
to	1
the	1
maids,	1
but	1
when	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
had	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
packed,	1
she	1
found	1
it	1
dull.	1
	1
"Dunyasha,	1
you	1
pack!	1
You	1
will,	1
won't	1
you,	1
dear?"	1
And	1
when	1
Dunyasha	1
willingly	1
promised	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
all	1
for	1
her,	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
took	1
her	1
old	1
ball	1
dress,	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
reverie	1
quite	1
unrelated	1
to	1
what	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
occupied	1
her	1
thoughts	1
now.	1
She	1
was	1
roused	1
from	1
her	1
reverie	1
by	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
(which	1
was	1
theirs)	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
hurried	1
footsteps	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
porch.	1
Natasha	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
An	1
enormously	1
long	1
row	1
of	1
carts	1
full	1
of	1
wounded	1
men	1
had	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
The	1
housekeeper,	1
the	1
old	1
nurse,	1
the	1
cooks,	1
coachmen,	1
maids,	1
footmen,	1
postilions,	1
and	1
scullions	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
wounded.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
throwing	1
a	1
clean	1
pocket	1
handkerchief	1
over	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
holding	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
each	1
hand,	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
The	1
former	1
housekeeper,	1
old	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
had	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
by	1
the	1
gate,	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
cart	1
with	1
a	1
hood	1
constructed	1
of	1
bast	1
mats,	1
and	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
a	1
pale	1
young	1
officer	1
who	1
lay	1
inside.	1
Natasha	1
moved	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
forward	1
and	1
stopped	1
shyly,	1
still	1
holding	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
have	1
nobody	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
she	1
was	1
saying.	1
"You	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
comfortable	1
somewhere	1
in	1
a	1
house...	1
in	1
ours,	1
for	1
instance...	1
the	1
family	1
are	1
leaving."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
allowed,"	1
replied	1
the	1
officer	1
in	1
a	1
weak	1
voice.	1
"Here	1
is	1
our	1
commanding	1
officer...	1
ask	1
him,"	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
stout	1
major	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
back	1
along	1
the	1
street	1
past	1
the	1
row	1
of	1
carts.	1
	1
Natasha	1
glanced	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
officer	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
major.	1
	1
"May	1
the	1
wounded	1
men	1
stay	1
in	1
our	1
house?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
The	1
major	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Which	1
one	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
Ma'am'selle?"	1
said	1
he,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
smiling.	1
	1
Natasha	1
quietly	1
repeated	1
her	1
question,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
whole	1
manner	1
were	1
so	1
serious,	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
holding	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
that	1
the	1
major	1
ceased	1
smiling	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
reflection--	1
as	1
if	1
considering	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
possible--replied	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
why	1
not?	1
They	1
may,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
slight	1
inclination	1
of	1
her	1
head,	1
Natasha	1
stepped	1
back	1
quickly	1
to	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
who	1
stood	1
talking	1
compassionately	1
to	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
"They	1
may.	1
He	1
says	1
they	1
may!"	1
whispered	1
Natasha.	1
	1
The	1
cart	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
officer	1
lay	1
was	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
yard,	1
and	1
dozens	1
of	1
carts	1
with	1
wounded	1
men	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
invitation	1
of	1
the	1
townsfolk	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
the	1
yards	1
and	1
to	1
draw	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
entrances	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
in	1
Povarskaya	1
Street.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
dealing	1
with	1
new	1
people	1
outside	1
the	1
ordinary	1
routine	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
She	1
and	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
as	1
possible	1
into	1
their	1
yard.	1
	1
"Your	1
Papa	1
must	1
be	1
told,	1
though,"	1
said	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna.	1
	1
"Never	1
mind,	1
never	1
mind,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter?	1
For	1
one	1
day	1
we	1
can	1
move	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
They	1
can	1
have	1
all	1
our	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
house."	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
young	1
lady,	1
you	1
do	1
take	1
things	1
into	1
your	1
head!	1
Even	1
if	1
we	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
wing,	1
the	1
men's	1
room,	1
or	1
the	1
nurse's	1
room,	1
we	1
must	1
ask	1
permission."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I'll	1
ask."	1
	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
through	1
the	1
half-open	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
vinegar	1
and	1
Hoffman's	1
drops.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
asleep,	1
Mamma?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
sleep-?"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
waking	1
up	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
dropping	1
into	1
a	1
doze.	1
	1
"Mamma	1
darling!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
kneeling	1
by	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
bringing	1
her	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
mother's,	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry,	1
forgive	1
me,	1
I'll	1
never	1
do	1
it	1
again;	1
I	1
woke	1
you	1
up!	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
has	1
sent	1
me:	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
some	1
wounded	1
here--officers.	1
Will	1
you	1
let	1
them	1
come?	1
They	1
have	1
nowhere	1
to	1
go.	1
I	1
knew	1
you'd	1
let	1
them	1
come!"	1
she	1
said	1
quickly	1
all	1
in	1
one	1
breath.	1
	1
"What	1
officers?	1
Whom	1
have	1
they	1
brought?	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
anything	1
about	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
Natasha	1
laughed,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
too	1
smiled	1
slightly.	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
you'd	1
give	1
permission...	1
so	1
I'll	1
tell	1
them,"	1
and,	1
having	1
kissed	1
her	1
mother,	1
Natasha	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
hall	1
she	1
met	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
bad	1
news.	1
	1
"We've	1
stayed	1
too	1
long!"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
involuntary	1
vexation.	1
"The	1
club	1
is	1
closed	1
and	1
the	1
police	1
are	1
leaving."	1
	1
"Papa,	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
right--I've	1
invited	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
into	1
the	1
house?"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
it	1
is,"	1
he	1
answered	1
absently.	1
"That's	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
indulge	1
in	1
trifles	1
now,	1
but	1
to	1
help	1
to	1
pack,	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
must	1
go,	1
go,	1
go!...."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
count	1
gave	1
a	1
similar	1
order	1
to	1
the	1
major-domo	1
and	1
the	1
servants.	1
	1
At	1
dinner	1
Petya	1
having	1
returned	1
home	1
told	1
them	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
heard.	1
He	1
said	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
been	1
getting	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
Rostopchin's	1
broadsheet	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
sound	1
a	1
call	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
advance,	1
the	1
order	1
had	1
certainly	1
already	1
been	1
given	1
for	1
everyone	1
to	1
go	1
armed	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
tomorrow,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
big	1
battle	1
there.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
looked	1
with	1
timid	1
horror	1
at	1
her	1
son's	1
eager,	1
excited	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this.	1
She	1
realized	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
his	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
(she	1
knew	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
engagement)	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
something	1
about	1
men,	1
honor,	1
and	1
the	1
fatherland-	1
-something	1
senseless,	1
masculine,	1
and	1
obstinate	1
which	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
contradicting,	1
and	1
her	1
plans	1
would	1
be	1
spoiled;	1
and	1
so,	1
hoping	1
to	1
arrange	1
to	1
leave	1
before	1
then	1
and	1
take	1
Petya	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
their	1
protector	1
and	1
defender,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
him,	1
but	1
after	1
dinner	1
called	1
the	1
count	1
aside	1
and	1
implored	1
him	1
with	1
tears	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
away	1
quickly,	1
that	1
very	1
night	1
if	1
possible.	1
With	1
a	1
woman's	1
involuntary	1
loving	1
cunning	1
she,	1
who	1
till	1
then	1
had	1
not	1
shown	1
any	1
alarm,	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
die	1
of	1
fright	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
that	1
very	1
night.	1
Without	1
any	1
pretense	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
afraid	1
of	1
everything.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
to	1
visit	1
her	1
daughter,	1
increased	1
the	1
countess'	1
fears	1
still	1
more	1
by	1
telling	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
a	1
spirit	1
dealer's	1
in	1
Myasnitski	1
Street.	1
When	1
returning	1
by	1
that	1
street	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
pass	1
because	1
of	1
a	1
drunken	1
crowd	1
rioting	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
shop.	1
She	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
driven	1
home	1
by	1
a	1
side	1
street	1
and	1
the	1
cabman	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
breaking	1
open	1
the	1
barrels	1
at	1
the	1
drink	1
store,	1
having	1
received	1
orders	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
After	1
dinner	1
the	1
whole	1
Rostov	1
household	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
enthusiastic	1
haste	1
packing	1
their	1
belongings	1
and	1
preparing	1
for	1
their	1
departure.	1
The	1
old	1
count,	1
suddenly	1
setting	1
to	1
work,	1
kept	1
passing	1
from	1
the	1
yard	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
back	1
again,	1
shouting	1
confused	1
instructions	1
to	1
the	1
hurrying	1
people,	1
and	1
flurrying	1
them	1
still	1
more.	1
Petya	1
directed	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
yard.	1
Sonya,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
contradictory	1
orders,	1
lost	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
servants	1
ran	1
noisily	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
yard,	1
shouting	1
and	1
disputing.	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
the	1
ardor	1
characteristic	1
of	1
all	1
she	1
did	1
suddenly	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
too.	1
At	1
first	1
her	1
intervention	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
packing	1
was	1
received	1
skeptically.	1
Everybody	1
expected	1
some	1
prank	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
obey	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
resolutely	1
and	1
passionately	1
demanded	1
obedience,	1
grew	1
angry	1
and	1
nearly	1
cried	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
heed	1
her,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
in	1
making	1
them	1
believe	1
her.	1
Her	1
first	1
exploit,	1
which	1
cost	1
her	1
immense	1
effort	1
and	1
established	1
her	1
authority,	1
was	1
the	1
packing	1
of	1
the	1
carpets.	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
valuable	1
Gobelin	1
tapestries	1
and	1
Persian	1
carpets	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
When	1
Natasha	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
two	1
cases	1
were	1
standing	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
one	1
almost	1
full	1
up	1
with	1
crockery,	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
carpets.	1
There	1
was	1
also	1
much	1
china	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
tables,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
was	1
being	1
brought	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
storeroom.	1
A	1
third	1
case	1
was	1
needed	1
and	1
servants	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
fetch	1
it.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
wait	1
a	1
bit--we'll	1
pack	1
everything	1
into	1
these,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"You	1
can't,	1
Miss,	1
we	1
have	1
tried	1
to,"	1
said	1
the	1
butler's	1
assistant.	1
	1
"No,	1
wait	1
a	1
minute,	1
please."	1
	1
And	1
Natasha	1
began	1
rapidly	1
taking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
dishes	1
and	1
plates	1
wrapped	1
in	1
paper.	1
	1
"The	1
dishes	1
must	1
go	1
in	1
here	1
among	1
the	1
carpets,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"Why,	1
it's	1
a	1
mercy	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
the	1
carpets	1
alone	1
into	1
three	1
cases,"	1
said	1
the	1
butler's	1
assistant.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
wait,	1
please!"	1
And	1
Natasha	1
began	1
rapidly	1
and	1
deftly	1
sorting	1
out	1
the	1
things.	1
"These	1
aren't	1
needed,"	1
said	1
she,	1
putting	1
aside	1
some	1
plates	1
of	1
Kiev	1
ware.	1
"These--yes,	1
these	1
must	1
go	1
among	1
the	1
carpets,"	1
she	1
said,	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
Saxony	1
china	1
dishes.	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Natasha!	1
Leave	1
it	1
alone!	1
We'll	1
get	1
it	1
all	1
packed,"	1
urged	1
Sonya	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
she	1
is!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
major-domo.	1
	1
But	1
Natasha	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
in.	1
She	1
turned	1
everything	1
out	1
and	1
began	1
quickly	1
repacking,	1
deciding	1
that	1
the	1
inferior	1
Russian	1
carpets	1
and	1
unnecessary	1
crockery	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
at	1
all.	1
When	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cases,	1
they	1
recommenced	1
packing,	1
and	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
cheaper	1
things	1
not	1
worth	1
taking	1
had	1
nearly	1
all	1
been	1
rejected,	1
the	1
valuable	1
ones	1
really	1
did	1
all	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
two	1
cases.	1
Only	1
the	1
lid	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
containing	1
the	1
carpets	1
would	1
not	1
shut	1
down.	1
A	1
few	1
more	1
things	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
out,	1
but	1
Natasha	1
insisted	1
on	1
having	1
her	1
own	1
way.	1
She	1
packed,	1
repacked,	1
pressed,	1
made	1
the	1
butler's	1
assistant	1
and	1
Petya--whom	1
she	1
had	1
drawn	1
into	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
packing--press	1
on	1
the	1
lid,	1
and	1
made	1
desperate	1
efforts	1
herself.	1
	1
"That's	1
enough,	1
Natasha,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
"I	1
see	1
you	1
were	1
right,	1
but	1
just	1
take	1
out	1
the	1
top	1
one."	1
	1
"I	1
won't!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
holding	1
back	1
the	1
hair	1
that	1
hung	1
over	1
her	1
perspiring	1
face,	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
pressed	1
down	1
the	1
carpets.	1
"Now	1
press,	1
Petya!	1
Press,	1
Vasilich,	1
press	1
hard!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
	1
The	1
carpets	1
yielded	1
and	1
the	1
lid	1
closed;	1
Natasha,	1
clapping	1
her	1
hands,	1
screamed	1
with	1
delight	1
and	1
tears	1
fell	1
from	1
her	1
eyes.	1
But	1
this	1
only	1
lasted	1
a	1
moment.	1
She	1
at	1
once	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
afresh	1
and	1
they	1
now	1
trusted	1
her	1
completely.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
not	1
angry	1
even	1
when	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
Natasha	1
had	1
countermanded	1
an	1
order	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
now	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
ask	1
whether	1
a	1
cart	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
loaded,	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
corded	1
up.	1
Thanks	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
directions	1
the	1
work	1
now	1
went	1
on	1
expeditiously,	1
unnecessary	1
things	1
were	1
left,	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
valuable	1
packed	1
as	1
compactly	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
But	1
hard	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
worked	1
till	1
quite	1
late	1
that	1
night,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
everything	1
packed.	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
and	1
the	1
count,	1
having	1
put	1
off	1
their	1
departure	1
till	1
next	1
morning,	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
slept	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
without	1
undressing.	1
	1
That	1
night	1
another	1
wounded	1
man	1
was	1
driven	1
down	1
the	1
Povarskaya,	1
and	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
had	1
him	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
yard.	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
concluded	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
man.	1
He	1
was	1
being	1
conveyed	1
in	1
a	1
caleche	1
with	1
a	1
raised	1
hood,	1
and	1
was	1
quite	1
covered	1
by	1
an	1
apron.	1
On	1
the	1
box	1
beside	1
the	1
driver	1
sat	1
a	1
venerable	1
old	1
attendant.	1
A	1
doctor	1
and	1
two	1
soldiers	1
followed	1
the	1
carriage	1
in	1
a	1
cart.	1
	1
"Please	1
come	1
in	1
here.	1
The	1
masters	1
are	1
going	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
will	1
be	1
empty,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
attendant.	1
	1
"Well,	1
perhaps,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"We	1
don't	1
expect	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
home	1
alive!	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
it's	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
from	1
here,	1
and	1
there's	1
nobody	1
living	1
in	1
it."	1
	1
"Do	1
us	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
come	1
in,	1
there's	1
plenty	1
of	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
master's	1
house.	1
Come	1
in,"	1
said	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna.	1
"Is	1
he	1
very	1
ill?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
The	1
attendant	1
made	1
a	1
hopeless	1
gesture.	1
	1
"We	1
don't	1
expect	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
home!	1
We	1
must	1
ask	1
the	1
doctor."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
got	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cart.	1
	1
"All	1
right!"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
servant	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
caleche,	1
looked	1
into	1
it,	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disconsolately,	1
told	1
the	1
driver	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
stopped	1
beside	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna.	1
	1
"O,	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ!"	1
she	1
murmured.	1
	1
She	1
invited	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"The	1
masters	1
won't	1
object..."	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
avoid	1
carrying	1
the	1
man	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wing	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
Madame	1
Schoss'.	1
	1
This	1
wounded	1
man	1
was	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski.	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
Moscow's	1
last	1
day	1
had	1
come.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
clear	1
bright	1
autumn	1
day,	1
a	1
Sunday.	1
The	1
church	1
bells	1
everywhere	1
were	1
ringing	1
for	1
service,	1
just	1
as	1
usual	1
on	1
Sundays.	1
Nobody	1
seemed	1
yet	1
to	1
realize	1
what	1
awaited	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
Only	1
two	1
things	1
indicated	1
the	1
social	1
condition	1
of	1
Moscow--the	1
rabble,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
poor	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
commodities.	1
An	1
enormous	1
crowd	1
of	1
factory	1
hands,	1
house	1
serfs,	1
and	1
peasants,	1
with	1
whom	1
some	1
officials,	1
seminarists,	1
and	1
gentry	1
were	1
mingled,	1
had	1
gone	1
early	1
that	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills.	1
Having	1
waited	1
there	1
for	1
Rostopchin	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
up,	1
they	1
became	1
convinced	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
surrendered,	1
and	1
then	1
dispersed	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
town	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
houses	1
and	1
cookshops.	1
Prices	1
too	1
that	1
day	1
indicated	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
affairs.	1
The	1
price	1
of	1
weapons,	1
of	1
gold,	1
of	1
carts	1
and	1
horses,	1
kept	1
rising,	1
but	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
paper	1
money	1
and	1
city	1
articles	1
kept	1
falling,	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
midday	1
there	1
were	1
instances	1
of	1
carters	1
removing	1
valuable	1
goods,	1
such	1
as	1
cloth,	1
and	1
receiving	1
in	1
payment	1
a	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
carted,	1
while	1
peasant	1
horses	1
were	1
fetching	1
five	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
each,	1
and	1
furniture,	1
mirrors,	1
and	1
bronzes	1
were	1
being	1
given	1
away	1
for	1
nothing.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
staid	1
old-fashioned	1
house	1
the	1
dissolution	1
of	1
former	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
but	1
little	1
noticeable.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
serfs	1
the	1
only	1
indication	1
was	1
that	1
three	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
huge	1
retinue	1
disappeared	1
during	1
the	1
night,	1
but	1
nothing	1
was	1
stolen;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
their	1
possessions,	1
the	1
thirty	1
peasant	1
carts	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
from	1
their	1
estates	1
and	1
which	1
many	1
people	1
envied	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
extremely	1
valuable	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
offered	1
enormous	1
sums	1
of	1
money	1
for	1
them.	1
Not	1
only	1
were	1
huge	1
sums	1
offered	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
carts,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
and	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
orderlies	1
and	1
servants	1
sent	1
by	1
wounded	1
officers	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
wounded	1
men	1
dragged	1
themselves	1
there	1
from	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
from	1
neighboring	1
houses	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
accommodated,	1
entreating	1
the	1
servants	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
them	1
a	1
lift	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
major-domo	1
to	1
whom	1
these	1
entreaties	1
were	1
addressed,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
wounded,	1
resolutely	1
refused,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
dare	1
not	1
even	1
mention	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
Pity	1
these	1
wounded	1
men	1
as	1
one	1
might,	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
given	1
one	1
cart	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
refuse	1
another,	1
or	1
all	1
the	1
carts	1
and	1
one's	1
own	1
carriages	1
as	1
well.	1
Thirty	1
carts	1
could	1
not	1
save	1
all	1
the	1
wounded	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
catastrophe	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
disregard	1
oneself	1
and	1
one's	1
own	1
family.	1
So	1
thought	1
the	1
major-domo	1
on	1
his	1
master's	1
behalf.	1
	1
On	1
waking	1
up	1
that	1
morning	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
left	1
his	1
bedroom	1
softly,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
wake	1
the	1
countess	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
only	1
toward	1
morning,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
in	1
his	1
lilac	1
silk	1
dressing	1
gown.	1
In	1
the	1
yard	1
stood	1
the	1
carts	1
ready	1
corded.	1
The	1
carriages	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
porch.	1
The	1
major-domo	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
porch	1
talking	1
to	1
an	1
elderly	1
orderly	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
pale	1
young	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bandaged	1
arm.	1
On	1
seeing	1
the	1
count	1
the	1
major-	1
domo	1
made	1
a	1
significant	1
and	1
stern	1
gesture	1
to	1
them	1
both	1
to	1
go	1
away.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Vasilich,	1
is	1
everything	1
ready?"	1
asked	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
stroking	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
he	1
looked	1
good-naturedly	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
the	1
orderly	1
and	1
nodded	1
to	1
them.	1
(He	1
liked	1
to	1
see	1
new	1
faces.)	1
	1
"We	1
can	1
harness	1
at	1
once,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
right.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
countess	1
wakes	1
we'll	1
be	1
off,	1
God	1
willing!	1
What	1
is	1
it,	1
gentlemen?"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
officer.	1
"Are	1
you	1
staying	1
in	1
my	1
house?"	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
suddenly	1
his	1
face	1
flushed	1
crimson.	1
	1
"Count,	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
allow	1
me...	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
some	1
corner	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
carts!	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
here	1
with	1
me....	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
on	1
a	1
loaded	1
cart..."	1
	1
Before	1
the	1
officer	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
the	1
orderly	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
request	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
yes,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
hastily.	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
pleased,	1
very	1
pleased.	1
Vasilich,	1
you'll	1
see	1
to	1
it.	1
Just	1
unload	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
carts.	1
Well,	1
what	1
of	1
it...	1
do	1
what's	1
necessary..."	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
muttering	1
some	1
indefinite	1
order.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
warm	1
gratitude	1
on	1
the	1
officer's	1
face	1
had	1
already	1
sealed	1
the	1
order.	1
The	1
count	1
looked	1
around	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
yard,	1
at	1
the	1
gates,	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
wings,	1
wounded	1
officers	1
and	1
their	1
orderlies	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
"Please	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
gallery,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
the	1
major-domo.	1
"What	1
are	1
your	1
orders	1
about	1
the	1
pictures?"	1
	1
The	1
count	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
him,	1
repeating	1
his	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
refuse	1
the	1
wounded	1
who	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
lift.	1
	1
"Well,	1
never	1
mind,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
can	1
be	1
unloaded,"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
soft,	1
confidential	1
voice,	1
as	1
though	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
overheard.	1
	1
At	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
the	1
countess	1
woke	1
up,	1
and	1
Matrena	1
Timofeevna,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
lady's	1
maid	1
before	1
her	1
marriage	1
and	1
now	1
performed	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
chief	1
gendarme's	1
duty	1
for	1
her,	1
came	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
Madame	1
Schoss	1
was	1
much	1
offended	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
ladies'	1
summer	1
dresses	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
behind.	1
On	1
inquiry,	1
the	1
countess	1
learned	1
that	1
Madame	1
Schoss	1
was	1
offended	1
because	1
her	1
trunk	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
down	1
from	1
its	1
cart,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
loads	1
were	1
being	1
uncorded	1
and	1
the	1
luggage	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carts	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
for	1
wounded	1
men	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
had	1
ordered	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
countess	1
sent	1
for	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
this,	1
my	1
dear?	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
the	1
luggage	1
is	1
being	1
unloaded."	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
love,	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you...	1
Countess	1
dear...	1
an	1
officer	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
carts	1
for	1
the	1
wounded.	1
After	1
all,	1
ours	1
are	1
things	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
bought	1
but	1
think	1
what	1
being	1
left	1
behind	1
means	1
to	1
them!...	1
Really	1
now,	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
yard--we	1
asked	1
them	1
in	1
ourselves	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
officers	1
among	1
them....	1
You	1
know,	1
I	1
think,	1
my	1
dear...	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
taken...	1
where's	1
the	1
hurry?"	1
	1
The	1
count	1
spoke	1
timidly,	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
talking	1
of	1
money	1
matters.	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
this	1
tone	1
as	1
a	1
precursor	1
of	1
news	1
of	1
something	1
detrimental	1
to	1
the	1
children's	1
interests,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
gallery	1
or	1
conservatory,	1
the	1
inauguration	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
theater	1
or	1
an	1
orchestra.	1
She	1
was	1
accustomed	1
always	1
to	1
oppose	1
anything	1
announced	1
in	1
that	1
timid	1
tone	1
and	1
considered	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
She	1
assumed	1
her	1
dolefully	1
submissive	1
manner	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband:	1
"Listen	1
to	1
me,	1
Count,	1
you	1
have	1
managed	1
matters	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
getting	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
throw	1
away	1
all	1
our--all	1
the	1
children's	1
property!	1
You	1
said	1
yourself	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rubles'	1
worth	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
I	1
don't	1
consent,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
don't!	1
Do	1
as	1
you	1
please!	1
It's	1
the	1
government's	1
business	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
wounded;	1
they	1
know	1
that.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
Lopukhins	1
opposite,	1
they	1
cleared	1
out	1
everything	1
two	1
days	1
ago.	1
That's	1
what	1
other	1
people	1
do.	1
It's	1
only	1
we	1
who	1
are	1
such	1
fools.	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
on	1
me,	1
have	1
some	1
for	1
the	1
children."	1
	1
Flourishing	1
his	1
arms	1
in	1
despair	1
the	1
count	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
replying.	1
	1
"Papa,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
that	1
for?"	1
asked	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
into	1
her	1
mother's	1
room.	1
	1
"Nothing!	1
What	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
yours?"	1
muttered	1
the	1
count	1
angrily.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
heard,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Why	1
does	1
Mamma	1
object?"	1
	1
"What	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
yours?"	1
cried	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
Natasha	1
stepped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
pondered.	1
	1
"Papa!	1
Here's	1
Berg	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
us,"	1
said	1
she,	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Berg,	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
son-in-law,	1
was	1
already	1
a	1
colonel	1
wearing	1
the	1
orders	1
of	1
Vladimir	1
and	1
Anna,	1
and	1
he	1
still	1
filled	1
the	1
quiet	1
and	1
agreeable	1
post	1
of	1
assistant	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
assistant	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
Second	1
Army.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow	1
from	1
the	1
army.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
asking	1
for	1
leave	1
to	1
visit	1
Moscow	1
and	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
there.	1
So	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
for	1
family	1
and	1
domestic	1
reasons.	1
	1
Berg	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
father-in-law's	1
house	1
in	1
his	1
spruce	1
little	1
trap	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
sleek	1
roans,	1
exactly	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
prince.	1
He	1
looked	1
attentively	1
at	1
the	1
carts	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
while	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
clean	1
pocket	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
tied	1
a	1
knot	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
anteroom	1
Berg	1
ran	1
with	1
smooth	1
though	1
impatient	1
steps	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
he	1
embraced	1
the	1
count,	1
kissed	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
"Mamma's"	1
health.	1
	1
"Health,	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
like	1
this?"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"Come,	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
news!	1
Is	1
the	1
army	1
retreating	1
or	1
will	1
there	1
be	1
another	1
battle?"	1
	1
"God	1
Almighty	1
alone	1
can	1
decide	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
our	1
fatherland,	1
Papa,"	1
said	1
Berg.	1
"The	1
army	1
is	1
burning	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
heroism	1
and	1
the	1
leaders,	1
so	1
to	1
say,	1
have	1
now	1
assembled	1
in	1
council.	1
No	1
one	1
knows	1
what	1
is	1
coming.	1
But	1
in	1
general	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
Papa,	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
heroic	1
spirit,	1
the	1
truly	1
antique	1
valor	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
which	1
they--which	1
it"	1
(he	1
corrected	1
himself)	1
"has	1
shown	1
or	1
displayed	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-sixth--	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
words	1
worthy	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
justice!	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Papa"	1
(he	1
smote	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
breast	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
speaking	1
had	1
done,	1
but	1
Berg	1
did	1
it	1
a	1
trifle	1
late	1
for	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
struck	1
his	1
breast	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
"Russian	1
army"),	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
frankly	1
that	1
we,	1
the	1
commanders,	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
to	1
urge	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
or	1
anything	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
could	1
hardly	1
restrain	1
those...	1
those...	1
yes,	1
those	1
exploits	1
of	1
antique	1
valor,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
rapidly.	1
"General	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly	1
risked	1
his	1
life	1
everywhere	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
troops,	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you.	1
Our	1
corps	1
was	1
stationed	1
on	1
a	1
hillside.	1
You	1
can	1
imagine!"	1
	1
And	1
Berg	1
related	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
tales	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
those	1
days.	1
Natasha	1
watched	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
intent	1
gaze	1
that	1
confused	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
some	1
question.	1
	1
"Altogether	1
such	1
heroism	1
as	1
was	1
displayed	1
by	1
the	1
Russian	1
warriors	1
cannot	1
be	1
imagined	1
or	1
adequately	1
praised!"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
glancing	1
round	1
at	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
anxious	1
to	1
conciliate	1
her,	1
replying	1
to	1
her	1
intent	1
look	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"'Russia	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
she	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
her	1
sons!'	1
Isn't	1
it	1
so,	1
Papa?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
the	1
countess	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
weary	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
expression.	1
Berg	1
hurriedly	1
jumped	1
up,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
asked	1
about	1
her	1
health,	1
and,	1
swaying	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
to	1
express	1
sympathy,	1
remained	1
standing	1
beside	1
her.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
sincerely	1
that	1
these	1
are	1
hard	1
and	1
sad	1
times	1
for	1
every	1
Russian.	1
But	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
anxious?	1
You	1
have	1
still	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
away...."	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
think	1
what	1
the	1
servants	1
are	1
about,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
nothing	1
is	1
ready	1
yet.	1
Somebody	1
after	1
all	1
must	1
see	1
to	1
things.	1
One	1
misses	1
Mitenka	1
at	1
such	1
times.	1
There	1
won't	1
be	1
any	1
end	1
to	1
it."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
evidently	1
restrained	1
himself.	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Berg	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
blow	1
his	1
nose	1
and,	1
seeing	1
the	1
knot	1
in	1
it,	1
pondered,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
sadly	1
and	1
significantly.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
favor	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
you,	1
Papa,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Hm..."	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
stopped.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
driving	1
past	1
Yusupov's	1
house	1
just	1
now,"	1
said	1
Berg	1
with	1
a	1
laugh,	1
"when	1
the	1
steward,	1
a	1
man	1
I	1
know,	1
ran	1
out	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
whether	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
buy	1
something.	1
I	1
went	1
in	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
chiffonier	1
and	1
a	1
dressing	1
table.	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
dear	1
Vera	1
wanted	1
a	1
chiffonier	1
like	1
that	1
and	1
how	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
dispute	1
about	1
it."	1
(At	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
chiffonier	1
and	1
dressing	1
table	1
Berg	1
involuntarily	1
changed	1
his	1
tone	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
pleasure	1
at	1
his	1
admirable	1
domestic	1
arrangements.)	1
"And	1
it's	1
such	1
a	1
beauty!	1
It	1
pulls	1
out	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
secret	1
English	1
drawer,	1
you	1
know!	1
And	1
dear	1
Vera	1
has	1
long	1
wanted	1
one.	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
surprise,	1
you	1
see.	1
I	1
saw	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
peasant	1
carts	1
in	1
your	1
yard.	1
Please	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
one,	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
the	1
man	1
well,	1
and..."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
frowned	1
and	1
coughed.	1
	1
"Ask	1
the	1
countess,	1
I	1
don't	1
give	1
orders."	1
	1
"If	1
it's	1
inconvenient,	1
please	1
don't,"	1
said	1
Berg.	1
"Only	1
I	1
so	1
wanted	1
it,	1
for	1
dear	1
Vera's	1
sake."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
devil,	1
all	1
of	1
you!	1
To	1
the	1
devil,	1
the	1
devil,	1
the	1
devil..."	1
cried	1
the	1
old	1
count.	1
"My	1
head's	1
in	1
a	1
whirl!"	1
	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
countess	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Mamma!	1
Yes,	1
these	1
are	1
very	1
hard	1
times!"	1
said	1
Berg.	1
	1
Natasha	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
finding	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
reach	1
some	1
decision,	1
first	1
followed	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
downstairs.	1
	1
Petya	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
porch,	1
engaged	1
in	1
giving	1
out	1
weapons	1
to	1
the	1
servants	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
loaded	1
carts	1
were	1
still	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
yard.	1
Two	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
uncorded	1
and	1
a	1
wounded	1
officer	1
was	1
climbing	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
helped	1
by	1
an	1
orderly.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
it's	1
about?"	1
Petya	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
	1
She	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
what	1
were	1
their	1
parents	1
quarreling	1
about.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
	1
"It's	1
because	1
Papa	1
wanted	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
carts	1
to	1
the	1
wounded,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
"Vasilich	1
told	1
me.	1
I	1
consider..."	1
	1
"I	1
consider,"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
almost	1
shouted,	1
turning	1
her	1
angry	1
face	1
to	1
Petya,	1
"I	1
consider	1
it	1
so	1
horrid,	1
so	1
abominable,	1
so...	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what.	1
Are	1
we	1
despicable	1
Germans?"	1
	1
Her	1
throat	1
quivered	1
with	1
convulsive	1
sobs	1
and,	1
afraid	1
of	1
weakening	1
and	1
letting	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
her	1
anger	1
run	1
to	1
waste,	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
rushed	1
headlong	1
up	1
the	1
stairs.	1
	1
Berg	1
was	1
sitting	1
beside	1
the	1
countess	1
consoling	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
respectful	1
attention	1
of	1
a	1
relative.	1
The	1
count,	1
pipe	1
in	1
hand,	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
when	1
Natasha,	1
her	1
face	1
distorted	1
by	1
anger,	1
burst	1
in	1
like	1
a	1
tempest	1
and	1
approached	1
her	1
mother	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps.	1
	1
"It's	1
horrid!	1
It's	1
abominable!"	1
she	1
screamed.	1
"You	1
can't	1
possibly	1
have	1
ordered	1
it!"	1
	1
Berg	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
perplexed	1
and	1
frightened.	1
The	1
count	1
stood	1
still	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
listened.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
it's	1
impossible:	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
yard!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"They	1
will	1
be	1
left!..."	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
Who	1
are	1
'they'?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
the	1
wounded!	1
It's	1
impossible,	1
Mamma.	1
It's	1
monstrous!...	1
No,	1
Mamma	1
darling,	1
it's	1
not	1
the	1
thing.	1
Please	1
forgive	1
me,	1
darling....	1
Mamma,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
what	1
we	1
take	1
away?	1
Only	1
look	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
yard...	1
Mamma!...	1
It's	1
impossible!"	1
	1
The	1
count	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
listened	1
without	1
turning	1
round.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
sniffed	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
face	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
daughter,	1
saw	1
her	1
face	1
full	1
of	1
shame	1
for	1
her	1
mother,	1
saw	1
her	1
agitation,	1
and	1
understood	1
why	1
her	1
husband	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
now,	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
round	1
quite	1
disconcerted.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
like!	1
Am	1
I	1
hindering	1
anyone?"	1
she	1
said,	1
not	1
surrendering	1
at	1
once.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
darling,	1
forgive	1
me!"	1
	1
But	1
the	1
countess	1
pushed	1
her	1
daughter	1
away	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,	1
you	1
order	1
what	1
is	1
right....	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
about	1
it,"	1
said	1
she,	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyes	1
shamefacedly.	1
	1
"The	1
eggs...	1
the	1
eggs	1
are	1
teaching	1
the	1
hen,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
count	1
through	1
tears	1
of	1
joy,	1
and	1
he	1
embraced	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
look	1
of	1
shame	1
on	1
his	1
breast.	1
	1
"Papa!	1
Mamma!	1
May	1
I	1
see	1
to	1
it?	1
May	1
I?..."	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
"We	1
will	1
still	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
most	1
necessary	1
things."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
nodded	1
affirmatively,	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
at	1
the	1
rapid	1
pace	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
run	1
when	1
playing	1
at	1
tag,	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
ballroom	1
to	1
the	1
anteroom	1
and	1
downstairs	1
into	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
The	1
servants	1
gathered	1
round	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
the	1
strange	1
order	1
she	1
brought	1
them	1
until	1
the	1
count	1
himself,	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
name,	1
confirmed	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
carts	1
to	1
the	1
wounded	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
trunks	1
to	1
the	1
storerooms.	1
When	1
they	1
understood	1
that	1
order	1
the	1
servants	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
this	1
new	1
task	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
zeal.	1
It	1
no	1
longer	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
done,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
anyone	1
that	1
the	1
wounded	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
the	1
goods	1
carted	1
away	1
but	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
The	1
whole	1
household,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
it	1
sooner,	1
set	1
eagerly	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
task	1
of	1
placing	1
the	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
carts.	1
The	1
wounded	1
dragged	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
rooms	1
and	1
stood	1
with	1
pale	1
but	1
happy	1
faces	1
round	1
the	1
carts.	1
The	1
news	1
that	1
carts	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
spread	1
to	1
the	1
neighboring	1
houses,	1
from	1
which	1
wounded	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
yard.	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
asked	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
unload	1
the	1
carts	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
things.	1
But	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
unloading,	1
once	1
started,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
arrested.	1
It	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
matter	1
whether	1
all	1
or	1
only	1
half	1
the	1
things	1
were	1
left	1
behind.	1
Cases	1
full	1
of	1
china,	1
bronzes,	1
pictures,	1
and	1
mirrors	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
carefully	1
packed	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
now	1
lay	1
about	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
still	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
searching	1
for	1
and	1
finding	1
possibilities	1
of	1
unloading	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
and	1
letting	1
the	1
wounded	1
have	1
another	1
and	1
yet	1
another	1
cart.	1
	1
"We	1
can	1
take	1
four	1
more	1
men,"	1
said	1
the	1
steward.	1
"They	1
can	1
have	1
my	1
trap,	1
or	1
else	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
become	1
of	1
them?"	1
	1
"Let	1
them	1
have	1
my	1
wardrobe	1
cart,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
"Dunyasha	1
can	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
carriage."	1
	1
They	1
unloaded	1
the	1
wardrobe	1
cart	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
wounded	1
men	1
from	1
a	1
house	1
two	1
doors	1
off.	1
The	1
whole	1
household,	1
servants	1
included,	1
was	1
bright	1
and	1
animated.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
rapturous	1
excitement	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
"What	1
could	1
we	1
fasten	1
this	1
onto?"	1
asked	1
the	1
servants,	1
trying	1
to	1
fix	1
a	1
trunk	1
on	1
the	1
narrow	1
footboard	1
behind	1
a	1
carriage.	1
"We	1
must	1
keep	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
cart."	1
	1
"What's	1
in	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"The	1
count's	1
books."	1
	1
"Leave	1
it,	1
Vasilich	1
will	1
put	1
it	1
away.	1
It's	1
not	1
wanted."	1
	1
The	1
phaeton	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
people	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
Count	1
Peter	1
could	1
sit.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
box.	1
You'll	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
box,	1
won't	1
you,	1
Petya?"	1
cried	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Sonya	1
too	1
was	1
busy	1
all	1
this	1
time,	1
but	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
her	1
efforts	1
was	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
Natasha's.	1
She	1
was	1
putting	1
away	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
countess	1
wished,	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
as	1
much	1
taken	1
away	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
possible.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Before	1
two	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
four	1
carriages,	1
packed	1
full	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
horses	1
harnessed,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
One	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
carts	1
with	1
the	1
wounded	1
had	1
moved	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
The	1
caleche	1
in	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
being	1
taken	1
attracted	1
Sonya's	1
attention	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
the	1
front	1
porch.	1
With	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
a	1
maid	1
she	1
was	1
arranging	1
a	1
seat	1
for	1
the	1
countess	1
in	1
the	1
huge	1
high	1
coach	1
that	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
entrance.	1
	1
"Whose	1
caleche	1
is	1
that?"	1
she	1
inquired,	1
leaning	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
window.	1
	1
"Why,	1
didn't	1
you	1
know,	1
Miss?"	1
replied	1
the	1
maid.	1
"The	1
wounded	1
prince:	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
our	1
house	1
and	1
is	1
going	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
"But	1
who	1
is	1
it?	1
What's	1
his	1
name?"	1
	1
"It's	1
our	1
intended	1
that	1
was--Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
himself!	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
dying,"	1
replied	1
the	1
maid	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
Sonya	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
countess.	1
The	1
countess,	1
tired	1
out	1
and	1
already	1
dressed	1
in	1
shawl	1
and	1
bonnet	1
for	1
her	1
journey,	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
household	1
to	1
assemble	1
for	1
the	1
usual	1
silent	1
prayer	1
with	1
closed	1
doors	1
before	1
starting.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Mamma,"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
"Prince	1
Andrew	1
is	1
here,	1
mortally	1
wounded.	1
He	1
is	1
going	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
in	1
dismay	1
and,	1
seizing	1
Sonya's	1
arm,	1
glanced	1
around.	1
	1
"Natasha?"	1
she	1
murmured.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
this	1
news	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
significance	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
They	1
knew	1
their	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
alarm	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
if	1
she	1
heard	1
this	1
news	1
stifled	1
all	1
sympathy	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
they	1
both	1
liked.	1
	1
"Natasha	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
yet,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
with	1
us,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"You	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
dying?"	1
	1
Sonya	1
nodded.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
put	1
her	1
arms	1
around	1
Sonya	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"The	1
ways	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
past	1
finding	1
out!"	1
she	1
thought,	1
feeling	1
that	1
the	1
Almighty	1
Hand,	1
hitherto	1
unseen,	1
was	1
becoming	1
manifest	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
now	1
taking	1
place.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Mamma?	1
Everything	1
is	1
ready.	1
What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
asked	1
Natasha,	1
as	1
with	1
animated	1
face	1
she	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Nothing,"	1
answered	1
the	1
countess.	1
"If	1
everything	1
is	1
ready	1
let	1
us	1
start."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
countess	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
reticule	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
agitated	1
face.	1
Sonya	1
embraced	1
Natasha	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
inquiringly.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
has	1
happened?"	1
	1
"Nothing...	1
No..."	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
something	1
very	1
bad	1
for	1
me?	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
persisted	1
Natasha	1
with	1
her	1
quick	1
intuition.	1
	1
Sonya	1
sighed	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
The	1
count,	1
Petya,	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
and	1
Vasilich	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and,	1
having	1
closed	1
the	1
doors,	1
they	1
all	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
remained	1
for	1
some	1
moments	1
silently	1
seated	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
rise,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
sigh	1
crossed	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
icon.	1
All	1
the	1
others	1
did	1
the	1
same.	1
Then	1
the	1
count	1
embraced	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
and	1
Vasilich,	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
caught	1
at	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
shoulder	1
he	1
patted	1
their	1
backs	1
lightly	1
with	1
some	1
vaguely	1
affectionate	1
and	1
comforting	1
words.	1
The	1
countess	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
oratory	1
and	1
there	1
Sonya	1
found	1
her	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
before	1
the	1
icons	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
wall.	1
(The	1
most	1
precious	1
ones,	1
with	1
which	1
some	1
family	1
tradition	1
was	1
connected,	1
were	1
being	1
taken	1
with	1
them.)	1
	1
In	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
the	1
men	1
whom	1
Petya	1
had	1
armed	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
daggers,	1
with	1
trousers	1
tucked	1
inside	1
their	1
high	1
boots	1
and	1
with	1
belts	1
and	1
girdles	1
tightened,	1
were	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
those	1
remaining	1
behind.	1
	1
As	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
at	1
a	1
departure,	1
much	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
or	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
place,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
two	1
menservants	1
stood	1
one	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
steps	1
waiting	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
countess	1
in,	1
while	1
maids	1
rushed	1
with	1
cushions	1
and	1
bundles	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
carriages,	1
the	1
caleche,	1
the	1
phaeton,	1
and	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
"They	1
always	1
will	1
forget	1
everything!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
can't	1
sit	1
like	1
that?"	1
	1
And	1
Dunyasha,	1
with	1
clenched	1
teeth,	1
without	1
replying	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
aggrieved	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
hastily	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
coach	1
to	1
rearrange	1
the	1
seat.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
those	1
servants!"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
swaying	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
Efim,	1
the	1
old	1
coachman,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
the	1
countess	1
trusted	1
to	1
drive	1
her,	1
sat	1
perched	1
up	1
high	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
glance	1
round	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
behind	1
him.	1
From	1
thirty	1
years'	1
experience	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
some	1
time	1
yet	1
before	1
the	1
order,	1
"Be	1
off,	1
in	1
God's	1
name!"	1
would	1
be	1
given	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
even	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
stopped	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
more	1
while	1
they	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
fetch	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten,	1
and	1
even	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
again	1
be	1
stopped	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
herself	1
would	1
lean	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
beg	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
heaven	1
to	1
drive	1
carefully	1
down	1
the	1
hill.	1
He	1
knew	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
therefore	1
waited	1
calmly	1
for	1
what	1
would	1
happen,	1
with	1
more	1
patience	1
than	1
the	1
horses,	1
especially	1
the	1
near	1
one,	1
the	1
chestnut	1
Falcon,	1
who	1
was	1
pawing	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
champing	1
his	1
bit.	1
At	1
last	1
all	1
were	1
seated,	1
the	1
carriage	1
steps	1
were	1
folded	1
and	1
pulled	1
up,	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut,	1
somebody	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
a	1
traveling	1
case,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
leaned	1
out	1
and	1
said	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
say.	1
Then	1
Efim	1
deliberately	1
doffed	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
began	1
crossing	1
himself.	1
The	1
postilion	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
servants	1
did	1
the	1
same.	1
"Off,	1
in	1
God's	1
name!"	1
said	1
Efim,	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
hat.	1
"Start!"	1
The	1
postilion	1
started	1
the	1
horses,	1
the	1
off	1
pole	1
horse	1
tugged	1
at	1
his	1
collar,	1
the	1
high	1
springs	1
creaked,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
swayed.	1
The	1
footman	1
sprang	1
onto	1
the	1
box	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
coach	1
which	1
jolted	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
onto	1
the	1
uneven	1
roadway;	1
the	1
other	1
vehicles	1
jolted	1
in	1
their	1
turn,	1
and	1
the	1
procession	1
of	1
carriages	1
moved	1
up	1
the	1
street.	1
In	1
the	1
carriages,	1
the	1
caleche,	1
and	1
the	1
phaeton,	1
all	1
crossed	1
themselves	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
the	1
church	1
opposite	1
the	1
house.	1
Those	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow	1
walked	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
vehicles	1
seeing	1
the	1
travelers	1
off.	1
	1
Rarely	1
had	1
Natasha	1
experienced	1
so	1
joyful	1
a	1
feeling	1
as	1
now,	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
beside	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
slowly	1
receding	1
walls	1
of	1
forsaken,	1
agitated	1
Moscow.	1
Occasionally	1
she	1
leaned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
window	1
and	1
looked	1
back	1
and	1
then	1
forward	1
at	1
the	1
long	1
train	1
of	1
wounded	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them.	1
Almost	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
raised	1
hood	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
caleche.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
each	1
time	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
procession	1
her	1
eyes	1
sought	1
that	1
caleche.	1
She	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
front.	1
	1
In	1
Kudrino,	1
from	1
the	1
Nikitski,	1
Presnya,	1
and	1
Podnovinsk	1
Streets	1
came	1
several	1
other	1
trains	1
of	1
vehicles	1
similar	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs',	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
Sadovaya	1
Street	1
the	1
carriages	1
and	1
carts	1
formed	1
two	1
rows	1
abreast.	1
	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
round	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
water	1
tower	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
inquisitively	1
and	1
alertly	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
people	1
driving	1
or	1
walking	1
past,	1
suddenly	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
joyful	1
surprise:	1
	1
"Dear	1
me!	1
Mamma,	1
Sonya,	1
look,	1
it's	1
he!"	1
	1
"Who?	1
Who?"	1
	1
"Look!	1
Yes,	1
on	1
my	1
word,	1
it's	1
Bezukhov!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
putting	1
her	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
staring	1
at	1
a	1
tall,	1
stout	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
coachman's	1
long	1
coat,	1
who	1
from	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
walking	1
and	1
moving	1
was	1
evidently	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
disguise,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
passing	1
under	1
the	1
arch	1
of	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
tower	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
small,	1
sallow-faced,	1
beardless	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
frieze	1
coat.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
really	1
is	1
Bezukhov	1
in	1
a	1
coachman's	1
coat,	1
with	1
a	1
queer-looking	1
old	1
boy.	1
Really,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
"look,	1
look!"	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
not	1
he.	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
such	1
nonsense?"	1
	1
"Mamma,"	1
screamed	1
Natasha,	1
"I'll	1
stake	1
my	1
head	1
it's	1
he!	1
I	1
assure	1
you!	1
Stop,	1
stop!"	1
she	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
coachman.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
coachman	1
could	1
not	1
stop,	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
Meshchanski	1
Street	1
came	1
more	1
carts	1
and	1
carriages,	1
and	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
being	1
shouted	1
at	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
and	1
not	1
block	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
In	1
fact,	1
however,	1
though	1
now	1
much	1
farther	1
off	1
than	1
before,	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
all	1
saw	1
Pierre--or	1
someone	1
extraordinarily	1
like	1
him--in	1
a	1
coachman's	1
coat,	1
going	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
with	1
head	1
bent	1
and	1
a	1
serious	1
face	1
beside	1
a	1
small,	1
beardless	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
footman.	1
That	1
old	1
man	1
noticed	1
a	1
face	1
thrust	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
window	1
gazing	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
respectfully	1
touching	1
Pierre's	1
elbow	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
carriage.	1
Pierre,	1
evidently	1
engrossed	1
in	1
thought,	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
understand	1
him.	1
At	1
length	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
indicated,	1
he	1
recognized	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
following	1
his	1
first	1
impulse	1
stepped	1
instantly	1
and	1
rapidly	1
toward	1
the	1
coach.	1
But	1
having	1
taken	1
a	1
dozen	1
steps	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
remember	1
something	1
and	1
stopped.	1
	1
Natasha's	1
face,	1
leaning	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
beamed	1
with	1
quizzical	1
kindliness.	1
	1
"Peter	1
Kirilovich,	1
come	1
here!	1
We	1
have	1
recognized	1
you!	1
This	1
is	1
wonderful!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing?	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
like	1
this?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
her	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
awkwardly	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
along	1
beside	1
her	1
while	1
the	1
coach	1
still	1
moved	1
on.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
Count?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
in	1
a	1
surprised	1
and	1
commiserating	1
tone.	1
	1
"What?	1
What?	1
Why?	1
Don't	1
ask	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
Natasha	1
whose	1
radiant,	1
happy	1
expression--of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her--filled	1
him	1
with	1
enchantment.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
remaining	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
then?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
hesitated.	1
	1
"In	1
Moscow?"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
questioning	1
tone.	1
"Yes,	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Good-bye!"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
if	1
only	1
I	1
were	1
a	1
man!	1
I'd	1
certainly	1
stay	1
with	1
you.	1
How	1
splendid!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Mamma,	1
if	1
you'll	1
let	1
me,	1
I'll	1
stay!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
absently	1
at	1
Natasha	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
the	1
countess	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
battle,	1
we	1
heard."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was,"	1
Pierre	1
answered.	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
another	1
battle	1
tomorrow..."	1
he	1
began,	1
but	1
Natasha	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
Count?	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
like	1
yourself...."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
ask	1
me,	1
don't	1
ask	1
me!	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
myself.	1
Tomorrow...	1
But	1
no!	1
Good-bye,	1
good-by!"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
"It's	1
an	1
awful	1
time!"	1
and	1
dropping	1
behind	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
stepped	1
onto	1
the	1
pavement.	1
	1
Natasha	1
continued	1
to	1
lean	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
beaming	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
kindly,	1
slightly	1
quizzical,	1
happy	1
smile.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
days,	1
ever	1
since	1
leaving	1
home,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
deceased	1
benefactor,	1
Bazdeev.	1
This	1
is	1
how	1
it	1
happened.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
woke	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
make	1
out	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
among	1
others	1
awaiting	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
reception	1
room	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
wife,	1
the	1
Countess	1
Helene,	1
he	1
felt	1
suddenly	1
overcome	1
by	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
confusion	1
and	1
hopelessness	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
apt	1
to	1
succumb.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
now	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
all	1
was	1
in	1
confusion	1
and	1
crumbling	1
to	1
pieces,	1
that	1
nobody	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong,	1
the	1
future	1
held	1
nothing,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
position.	1
Smiling	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
muttering	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
first	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
an	1
attitude	1
of	1
despair,	1
then	1
rose,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
and	1
peeped	1
through	1
the	1
crack,	1
returned	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
book.	1
His	1
major-domo	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
if	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
minute,	1
and	1
that	1
someone	1
from	1
Bazdeev's	1
widow	1
had	1
called	1
to	1
ask	1
Pierre	1
to	1
take	1
charge	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
books,	1
as	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
leaving	1
for	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
in	1
a	1
minute;	1
wait...	1
or	1
no!	1
No,	1
of	1
course...	1
go	1
and	1
say	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
directly,"	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
to	1
the	1
major-domo.	1
	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
Pierre	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
hat	1
which	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
study	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
He	1
went	1
along	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
this	1
passage	1
to	1
the	1
stairs	1
and,	1
frowning	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
forehead	1
with	1
both	1
hands,	1
went	1
down	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
landing.	1
The	1
hall	1
porter	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
From	1
the	1
landing	1
where	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
second	1
staircase	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
entrance.	1
He	1
went	1
down	1
that	1
staircase	1
and	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
seen	1
him.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
carriages	1
waiting,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Pierre	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
the	1
coachmen	1
and	1
the	1
yard	1
porter	1
noticed	1
him	1
and	1
raised	1
their	1
caps	1
to	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
looked	1
at	1
he	1
behaved	1
like	1
an	1
ostrich	1
which	1
hides	1
its	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
bush	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
seen:	1
he	1
hung	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
quickening	1
his	1
pace	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
affairs	1
awaiting	1
Pierre	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
sorting	1
of	1
Joseph	1
Bazdeev's	1
books	1
and	1
papers	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
necessary.	1
	1
He	1
hired	1
the	1
first	1
cab	1
he	1
met	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
driver	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Patriarch's	1
Ponds,	1
where	1
the	1
widow	1
Bazdeev's	1
house	1
was.	1
	1
Continually	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
loaded	1
carts	1
that	1
were	1
making	1
their	1
way	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
balancing	1
his	1
bulky	1
body	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
slip	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ramshackle	1
old	1
vehicle,	1
Pierre,	1
experiencing	1
the	1
joyful	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
escaping	1
from	1
school,	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
his	1
driver.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
arms	1
were	1
being	1
distributed	1
today	1
at	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
and	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
everyone	1
would	1
be	1
sent	1
out	1
beyond	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
gates	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
battle	1
would	1
be	1
fought	1
there.	1
	1
Having	1
reached	1
the	1
Patriarch's	1
Ponds	1
Pierre	1
found	1
the	1
Bazdeevs'	1
house,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
past.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
Gerasim,	1
that	1
sallow	1
beardless	1
old	1
man	1
Pierre	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
Torzhok	1
five	1
years	1
before	1
with	1
Joseph	1
Bazdeev,	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
knock.	1
	1
"At	1
home?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Owing	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
Sophia	1
Danilovna	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
Torzhok	1
estate	1
with	1
the	1
children,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
look	1
through	1
the	1
books,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
step	1
in.	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
my	1
late	1
master--may	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
be	1
his--has	1
remained	1
here,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
weak	1
state	1
as	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
servant.	1
	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
that	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
Joseph	1
Bazdeev's	1
half-insane	1
brother	1
and	1
a	1
hard	1
drinker.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
know.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
in..."	1
said	1
Pierre	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
A	1
tall,	1
bald-headed	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
nose,	1
wearing	1
a	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
with	1
galoshes	1
on	1
his	1
bare	1
feet,	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Pierre	1
he	1
muttered	1
something	1
angrily	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
man	1
but	1
has	1
now	1
grown	1
quite	1
feeble,	1
as	1
your	1
honor	1
sees,"	1
said	1
Gerasim.	1
"Will	1
you	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
study?"	1
Pierre	1
nodded.	1
"As	1
it	1
was	1
sealed	1
up	1
so	1
it	1
has	1
remained,	1
but	1
Sophia	1
Danilovna	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
if	1
anyone	1
should	1
come	1
from	1
you	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
books."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
into	1
that	1
gloomy	1
study	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
with	1
such	1
trepidation	1
in	1
his	1
benefactor's	1
lifetime.	1
The	1
room,	1
dusty	1
and	1
untouched	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Joseph	1
Bazdeev	1
was	1
now	1
even	1
gloomier.	1
	1
Gerasim	1
opened	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
shutters	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
on	1
tiptoe.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
study,	1
approached	1
the	1
cupboard	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
manuscripts	1
were	1
kept,	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important,	1
the	1
holy	1
of	1
holies	1
of	1
the	1
order.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
authentic	1
Scotch	1
Acts	1
with	1
Bazdeev's	1
notes	1
and	1
explanations.	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
dusty	1
writing	1
table,	1
and,	1
having	1
laid	1
the	1
manuscripts	1
before	1
him,	1
opened	1
them	1
out,	1
closed	1
them,	1
finally	1
pushed	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
resting	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
sank	1
into	1
meditation.	1
	1
Gerasim	1
looked	1
cautiously	1
into	1
the	1
study	1
several	1
times	1
and	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
always	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
attitude.	1
	1
More	1
than	1
two	1
hours	1
passed	1
and	1
Gerasim	1
took	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
slight	1
noise	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
attract	1
his	1
attention,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
cabman	1
to	1
be	1
discharged,	1
your	1
honor?"	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
rousing	1
himself	1
and	1
rising	1
hurriedly.	1
"Look	1
here,"	1
he	1
added,	1
taking	1
Gerasim	1
by	1
a	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
moist,	1
shining,	1
and	1
ecstatic	1
eyes,	1
"I	1
say,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
battle	1
tomorrow?"	1
	1
"We	1
heard	1
so,"	1
replied	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
anyone	1
who	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
ask	1
you."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
Gerasim.	1
"Will	1
you	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
eat?"	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
want	1
something	1
else.	1
I	1
want	1
peasant	1
clothes	1
and	1
a	1
pistol,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
unexpectedly	1
blushing.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
Gerasim	1
after	1
thinking	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
Pierre	1
spent	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
benefactor's	1
study,	1
and	1
Gerasim	1
heard	1
him	1
pacing	1
restlessly	1
from	1
one	1
corner	1
to	1
another	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
himself.	1
And	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
Gerasim,	1
being	1
a	1
servant	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
time	1
had	1
seen	1
many	1
strange	1
things,	1
accepted	1
Pierre's	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
residence	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
without	1
surprise,	1
and	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
someone	1
to	1
wait	1
on.	1
That	1
same	1
evening--	1
without	1
even	1
asking	1
himself	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
wanted	1
for--he	1
procured	1
a	1
coachman's	1
coat	1
and	1
cap	1
for	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
the	1
pistol	1
next	1
day.	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
came	1
twice	1
that	1
evening	1
shuffling	1
along	1
in	1
his	1
galoshes	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
ingratiatingly	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
toward	1
him	1
he	1
wrapped	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
shamefaced	1
and	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
hurried	1
away.	1
It	1
was	1
when	1
Pierre	1
(wearing	1
the	1
coachman's	1
coat	1
which	1
Gerasim	1
had	1
procured	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
disinfected	1
by	1
steam)	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
to	1
buy	1
the	1
pistol	1
at	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
market	1
that	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
order	1
to	1
retreat	1
through	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road	1
was	1
issued	1
at	1
night	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
troops	1
started	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
they	1
marched	1
slowly	1
and	1
steadily	1
without	1
hurry.	1
At	1
daybreak,	1
however,	1
those	1
nearing	1
the	1
town	1
at	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
bridge	1
saw	1
ahead	1
of	1
them	1
masses	1
of	1
soldiers	1
crowding	1
and	1
hurrying	1
across	1
the	1
bridge,	1
ascending	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
and	1
blocking	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
alleys,	1
while	1
endless	1
masses	1
of	1
troops	1
were	1
bearing	1
down	1
on	1
them	1
from	1
behind,	1
and	1
an	1
unreasoning	1
hurry	1
and	1
alarm	1
overcame	1
them.	1
They	1
all	1
rushed	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
bridge,	1
onto	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
fords	1
and	1
the	1
boats.	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
had	1
driven	1
round	1
by	1
side	1
streets	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
	1
By	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September,	1
only	1
the	1
rear	1
guard	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
suburb,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
ample	1
room.	1
The	1
main	1
army	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Moscow	1
or	1
beyond	1
it.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
very	1
time,	1
at	1
ten	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September,	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
standing	1
among	1
his	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
panorama	1
spread	1
out	1
before	1
him.	1
From	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
of	1
August	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September,	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
to	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
into	1
Moscow,	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
agitating,	1
memorable	1
week,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
autumn	1
weather	1
that	1
always	1
comes	1
as	1
a	1
surprise,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
hangs	1
low	1
and	1
gives	1
more	1
heat	1
than	1
in	1
spring,	1
when	1
everything	1
shines	1
so	1
brightly	1
in	1
the	1
rare	1
clear	1
atmosphere	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
smart,	1
when	1
the	1
lungs	1
are	1
strengthened	1
and	1
refreshed	1
by	1
inhaling	1
the	1
aromatic	1
autumn	1
air,	1
when	1
even	1
the	1
nights	1
are	1
warm,	1
and	1
when	1
in	1
those	1
dark	1
warm	1
nights,	1
golden	1
stars	1
startle	1
and	1
delight	1
us	1
continually	1
by	1
falling	1
from	1
the	1
sky.	1
	1
At	1
ten	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September	1
this	1
weather	1
still	1
held.	1
	1
The	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
magical.	1
Moscow	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
lay	1
spaciously	1
spread	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
river,	1
her	1
gardens,	1
and	1
her	1
churches,	1
and	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
living	1
her	1
usual	1
life,	1
her	1
cupolas	1
glittering	1
like	1
stars	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight.	1
	1
The	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
city	1
with	1
its	1
peculiar	1
architecture,	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before,	1
filled	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
the	1
rather	1
envious	1
and	1
uneasy	1
curiosity	1
men	1
feel	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
an	1
alien	1
form	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
has	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them.	1
This	1
city	1
was	1
evidently	1
living	1
with	1
the	1
full	1
force	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
life.	1
By	1
the	1
indefinite	1
signs	1
which,	1
even	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
distinguish	1
a	1
living	1
body	1
from	1
a	1
dead	1
one,	1
Napoleon	1
from	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
perceived	1
the	1
throb	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
felt,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
the	1
breathing	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
beautiful	1
body.	1
	1
Every	1
Russian	1
looking	1
at	1
Moscow	1
feels	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mother;	1
every	1
foreigner	1
who	1
sees	1
her,	1
even	1
if	1
ignorant	1
of	1
her	1
significance	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
city,	1
must	1
feel	1
her	1
feminine	1
character,	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
felt	1
it.	1
	1
"Cette	1
ville	1
asiatique	1
aux	1
innombrables	1
eglises,	1
Moscou	1
la	1
sainte.	1
La	1
voila	1
done	1
enfin,	1
cette	1
fameuse	1
ville!	1
Il	1
etait	1
temps,"	1
*	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
dismounting	1
he	1
ordered	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
Moscow	1
to	1
be	1
spread	1
out	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
summoned	1
Lelorgne	1
d'Ideville,	1
the	1
interpreter.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"That	1
Asiatic	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
churches,	1
holy	1
Moscow!	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
then	1
at	1
last,	1
that	1
famous	1
city.	1
It	1
was	1
high	1
time."	1
	1
"A	1
town	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
enemy	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
maid	1
who	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
honor,"	1
thought	1
he	1
(he	1
had	1
said	1
so	1
to	1
Tuchkov	1
at	1
Smolensk).	1
From	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
Oriental	1
beauty	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
before.	1
It	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
long-felt	1
wish,	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
unattainable,	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
been	1
realized.	1
In	1
the	1
clear	1
morning	1
light	1
he	1
gazed	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
plan,	1
considering	1
its	1
details,	1
and	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
possessing	1
it	1
agitated	1
and	1
awed	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
otherwise?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Here	1
is	1
this	1
capital	1
at	1
my	1
feet.	1
Where	1
is	1
Alexander	1
now,	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
he	1
thinking?	1
A	1
strange,	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
majestic	1
city;	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
majestic	1
moment!	1
In	1
what	1
light	1
must	1
I	1
appear	1
to	1
them!"	1
thought	1
he,	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
troops.	1
"Here	1
she	1
is,	1
the	1
reward	1
for	1
all	1
those	1
fainthearted	1
men,"	1
he	1
reflected,	1
glancing	1
at	1
those	1
near	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
troops	1
who	1
were	1
approaching	1
and	1
forming	1
up.	1
"One	1
word	1
from	1
me,	1
one	1
movement	1
of	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
that	1
ancient	1
capital	1
of	1
the	1
Tsars	1
would	1
perish.	1
But	1
my	1
clemency	1
is	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
descend	1
upon	1
the	1
vanquished.	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
magnanimous	1
and	1
truly	1
great.	1
But	1
no,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
Moscow,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
thought.	1
"Yet	1
here	1
she	1
is	1
lying	1
at	1
my	1
feet,	1
with	1
her	1
golden	1
domes	1
and	1
crosses	1
scintillating	1
and	1
twinkling	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine.	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
spare	1
her.	1
On	1
the	1
ancient	1
monuments	1
of	1
barbarism	1
and	1
despotism	1
I	1
will	1
inscribe	1
great	1
words	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
mercy....	1
It	1
is	1
just	1
this	1
which	1
Alexander	1
will	1
feel	1
most	1
painfully,	1
I	1
know	1
him."	1
(It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
import	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
personal	1
struggle	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
Alexander.)	1
"From	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
Kremlin--yes,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
yes--I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
just	1
laws;	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
them	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
true	1
civilization,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
generations	1
of	1
boyars	1
remember	1
their	1
conqueror	1
with	1
love.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
the	1
deputation	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not,	1
and	1
do	1
not,	1
desire	1
war,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
waged	1
war	1
only	1
against	1
the	1
false	1
policy	1
of	1
their	1
court;	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
Alexander	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
Moscow	1
I	1
will	1
accept	1
terms	1
of	1
peace	1
worthy	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
utilize	1
the	1
fortunes	1
of	1
war	1
to	1
humiliate	1
an	1
honored	1
monarch.	1
'Boyars,'	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
them,	1
'I	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
war,	1
I	1
desire	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
welfare	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
subjects.'	1
However,	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
presence	1
will	1
inspire	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
do:	1
clearly,	1
impressively,	1
and	1
majestically.	1
But	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
Moscow?	1
Yes,	1
there	1
she	1
lies."	1
	1
"Qu'on	1
m'amene	1
les	1
boyars,"	1
*	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
suite.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Bring	1
the	1
boyars	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
A	1
general	1
with	1
a	1
brilliant	1
suite	1
galloped	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
boyars.	1
	1
Two	1
hours	1
passed.	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
lunched	1
and	1
was	1
again	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
awaiting	1
the	1
deputation.	1
His	1
speech	1
to	1
the	1
boyars	1
had	1
already	1
taken	1
definite	1
shape	1
in	1
his	1
imagination.	1
That	1
speech	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
dignity	1
and	1
greatness	1
as	1
Napoleon	1
understood	1
it.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
himself	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
magnanimity	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
adopt	1
toward	1
Moscow.	1
In	1
his	1
imagination	1
he	1
appointed	1
days	1
for	1
assemblies	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
Tsars,	1
at	1
which	1
Russian	1
notables	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
would	1
mingle.	1
He	1
mentally	1
appointed	1
a	1
governor,	1
one	1
who	1
would	1
win	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Having	1
learned	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
charitable	1
institutions	1
in	1
Moscow	1
he	1
mentally	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shower	1
favors	1
on	1
them	1
all.	1
He	1
thought	1
that,	1
as	1
in	1
Africa	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
burnoose	1
and	1
sit	1
in	1
a	1
mosque,	1
so	1
in	1
Moscow	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
beneficent	1
like	1
the	1
Tsars.	1
And	1
in	1
order	1
finally	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Russians--and	1
being	1
like	1
all	1
Frenchmen	1
unable	1
to	1
imagine	1
anything	1
sentimental	1
without	1
a	1
reference	1
to	1
ma	1
chere,	1
ma	1
tendre,	1
ma	1
pauvre	1
mere	1
*	1
--he	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
place	1
an	1
inscription	1
on	1
all	1
these	1
establishments	1
in	1
large	1
letters:	1
"This	1
establishment	1
is	1
dedicated	1
to	1
my	1
dear	1
mother."	1
Or	1
no,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
simply:	1
Maison	1
de	1
ma	1
Mere,	1
*(2)	1
he	1
concluded.	1
"But	1
am	1
I	1
really	1
in	1
Moscow?	1
Yes,	1
here	1
it	1
lies	1
before	1
me,	1
but	1
why	1
is	1
the	1
deputation	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
appearing?"	1
he	1
wondered.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"My	1
dear,	1
my	1
tender,	1
my	1
poor	1
mother."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"House	1
of	1
my	1
Mother."	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
an	1
agitated	1
consultation	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
whispers	1
among	1
his	1
generals	1
and	1
marshals	1
at	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
his	1
suite.	1
Those	1
sent	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
deputation	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
empty,	1
that	1
everyone	1
had	1
left	1
it.	1
The	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
conferring	1
together	1
were	1
pale	1
and	1
perturbed.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
alarmed	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
by	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
(grave	1
as	1
that	1
fact	1
seemed),	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
Emperor--without	1
putting	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
terrible	1
position	1
of	1
appearing	1
ridiculous--that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
awaiting	1
the	1
boyars	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
vain:	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
drunken	1
mobs	1
left	1
in	1
Moscow	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
else.	1
Some	1
said	1
that	1
a	1
deputation	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
must	1
be	1
scraped	1
together,	1
others	1
disputed	1
that	1
opinion	1
and	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
should	1
first	1
be	1
carefully	1
and	1
skillfully	1
prepared,	1
and	1
then	1
told	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
"He	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
said	1
some	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
suite.	1
"But,	1
gentlemen..."	1
	1
The	1
position	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
awkward	1
because	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
meditating	1
upon	1
his	1
magnanimous	1
plans,	1
was	1
pacing	1
patiently	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
outspread	1
map,	1
occasionally	1
glancing	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Moscow	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
lifted	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
and	1
proud	1
smile.	1
	1
"But	1
it's	1
impossible..."	1
declared	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
shrugging	1
their	1
shoulders	1
but	1
not	1
venturing	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
implied	1
word--le	1
ridicule...	1
	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
tired	1
of	1
futile	1
expectation,	1
his	1
actor's	1
instinct	1
suggesting	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
sublime	1
moment	1
having	1
been	1
too	1
long	1
drawn	1
out	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
lose	1
its	1
sublimity,	1
gave	1
a	1
sign	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
A	1
single	1
report	1
of	1
a	1
signaling	1
gun	1
followed,	1
and	1
the	1
troops,	1
who	1
were	1
already	1
spread	1
out	1
on	1
different	1
sides	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
through	1
Tver,	1
Kaluga,	1
and	1
Dorogomilov	1
gates.	1
Faster	1
and	1
faster,	1
vying	1
with	1
one	1
another,	1
they	1
moved	1
at	1
the	1
double	1
or	1
at	1
a	1
trot,	1
vanishing	1
amid	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
dust	1
they	1
raised	1
and	1
making	1
the	1
air	1
ring	1
with	1
a	1
deafening	1
roar	1
of	1
mingling	1
shouts.	1
	1
Drawn	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
troops	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
gate,	1
but	1
there	1
again	1
stopped	1
and,	1
dismounting	1
from	1
his	1
horse,	1
paced	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
Kammer-Kollezski	1
rampart,	1
awaiting	1
the	1
deputation.	1

CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Moscow	1
was	1
empty.	1
There	1
were	1
still	1
people	1
in	1
it,	1
perhaps	1
a	1
fiftieth	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
former	1
inhabitants	1
had	1
remained,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
empty.	1
It	1
was	1
empty	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
a	1
dying	1
queenless	1
hive	1
is	1
empty.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
queenless	1
hive	1
no	1
life	1
is	1
left	1
though	1
to	1
a	1
superficial	1
glance	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
much	1
alive	1
as	1
other	1
hives.	1
	1
The	1
bees	1
circle	1
round	1
a	1
queenless	1
hive	1
in	1
the	1
hot	1
beams	1
of	1
the	1
midday	1
sun	1
as	1
gaily	1
as	1
around	1
the	1
living	1
hives;	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
it	1
smells	1
of	1
honey	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
bees	1
fly	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
But	1
one	1
has	1
only	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
hive	1
to	1
realize	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
life	1
in	1
it.	1
The	1
bees	1
do	1
not	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
the	1
smell	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
that	1
meet	1
the	1
beekeeper	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
same.	1
To	1
the	1
beekeeper's	1
tap	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
sick	1
hive,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
instant	1
unanimous	1
humming	1
of	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
bees	1
with	1
their	1
abdomens	1
threateningly	1
compressed,	1
and	1
producing	1
by	1
the	1
rapid	1
vibration	1
of	1
their	1
wings	1
an	1
aerial	1
living	1
sound,	1
the	1
only	1
reply	1
is	1
a	1
disconnected	1
buzzing	1
from	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
deserted	1
hive.	1
From	1
the	1
alighting	1
board,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
spirituous	1
fragrant	1
smell	1
of	1
honey	1
and	1
venom,	1
and	1
the	1
warm	1
whiffs	1
of	1
crowded	1
life,	1
comes	1
an	1
odor	1
of	1
emptiness	1
and	1
decay	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
honey.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
sentinels	1
sounding	1
the	1
alarm	1
with	1
their	1
abdomens	1
raised,	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
hive.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
measured	1
quiet	1
sound	1
of	1
throbbing	1
activity,	1
like	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
boiling	1
water,	1
but	1
diverse	1
discordant	1
sounds	1
of	1
disorder.	1
In	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
long	1
black	1
robber	1
bees	1
smeared	1
with	1
honey	1
fly	1
timidly	1
and	1
shiftily.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
sting,	1
but	1
crawl	1
away	1
from	1
danger.	1
Formerly	1
only	1
bees	1
laden	1
with	1
honey	1
flew	1
into	1
the	1
hive,	1
and	1
they	1
flew	1
out	1
empty;	1
now	1
they	1
fly	1
out	1
laden.	1
The	1
beekeeper	1
opens	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
and	1
peers	1
in.	1
Instead	1
of	1
black,	1
glossy	1
bees--tamed	1
by	1
toil,	1
clinging	1
to	1
one	1
another's	1
legs	1
and	1
drawing	1
out	1
the	1
wax,	1
with	1
a	1
ceaseless	1
hum	1
of	1
labor--that	1
used	1
to	1
hang	1
in	1
long	1
clusters	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
hive,	1
drowsy	1
shriveled	1
bees	1
crawl	1
about	1
separately	1
in	1
various	1
directions	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
hive.	1
Instead	1
of	1
a	1
neatly	1
glued	1
floor,	1
swept	1
by	1
the	1
bees	1
with	1
the	1
fanning	1
of	1
their	1
wings,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
floor	1
littered	1
with	1
bits	1
of	1
wax,	1
excrement,	1
dying	1
bees	1
scarcely	1
moving	1
their	1
legs,	1
and	1
dead	1
ones	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
cleared	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
beekeeper	1
opens	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
and	1
examines	1
the	1
super.	1
Instead	1
of	1
serried	1
rows	1
of	1
bees	1
sealing	1
up	1
every	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
combs	1
and	1
keeping	1
the	1
brood	1
warm,	1
he	1
sees	1
the	1
skillful	1
complex	1
structures	1
of	1
the	1
combs,	1
but	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
their	1
former	1
state	1
of	1
purity.	1
All	1
is	1
neglected	1
and	1
foul.	1
Black	1
robber	1
bees	1
are	1
swiftly	1
and	1
stealthily	1
prowling	1
about	1
the	1
combs,	1
and	1
the	1
short	1
home	1
bees,	1
shriveled	1
and	1
listless	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
old,	1
creep	1
slowly	1
about	1
without	1
trying	1
to	1
hinder	1
the	1
robbers,	1
having	1
lost	1
all	1
motive	1
and	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
life.	1
Drones,	1
bumblebees,	1
wasps,	1
and	1
butterflies	1
knock	1
awkwardly	1
against	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
in	1
their	1
flight.	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
among	1
the	1
cells	1
containing	1
dead	1
brood	1
and	1
honey	1
an	1
angry	1
buzzing	1
can	1
sometimes	1
be	1
heard.	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
bees,	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
and	1
custom	1
cleaning	1
out	1
the	1
brood	1
cells,	1
with	1
efforts	1
beyond	1
their	1
strength	1
laboriously	1
drag	1
away	1
a	1
dead	1
bee	1
or	1
bumblebee	1
without	1
knowing	1
why	1
they	1
do	1
it.	1
In	1
another	1
corner	1
two	1
old	1
bees	1
are	1
languidly	1
fighting,	1
or	1
cleaning	1
themselves,	1
or	1
feeding	1
one	1
another,	1
without	1
themselves	1
knowing	1
whether	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
friendly	1
or	1
hostile	1
intent.	1
In	1
a	1
third	1
place	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
bees,	1
crushing	1
one	1
another,	1
attack	1
some	1
victim	1
and	1
fight	1
and	1
smother	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
victim,	1
enfeebled	1
or	1
killed,	1
drops	1
from	1
above	1
slowly	1
and	1
lightly	1
as	1
a	1
feather,	1
among	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
corpses.	1
The	1
keeper	1
opens	1
the	1
two	1
center	1
partitions	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
brood	1
cells.	1
In	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
close	1
dark	1
circles	1
formed	1
by	1
thousands	1
of	1
bees	1
sitting	1
back	1
to	1
back	1
and	1
guarding	1
the	1
high	1
mystery	1
of	1
generation,	1
he	1
sees	1
hundreds	1
of	1
dull,	1
listless,	1
and	1
sleepy	1
shells	1
of	1
bees.	1
They	1
have	1
almost	1
all	1
died	1
unawares,	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
they	1
had	1
guarded	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
now	1
no	1
more.	1
They	1
reek	1
of	1
decay	1
and	1
death.	1
Only	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
still	1
move,	1
rise,	1
and	1
feebly	1
fly	1
to	1
settle	1
on	1
the	1
enemy's	1
hand,	1
lacking	1
the	1
spirit	1
to	1
die	1
stinging	1
him;	1
the	1
rest	1
are	1
dead	1
and	1
fall	1
as	1
lightly	1
as	1
fish	1
scales.	1
The	1
beekeeper	1
closes	1
the	1
hive,	1
chalks	1
a	1
mark	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
time	1
tears	1
out	1
its	1
contents	1
and	1
burns	1
it	1
clean.	1
	1
So	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
Moscow	1
was	1
empty	1
when	1
Napoleon,	1
weary,	1
uneasy,	1
and	1
morose,	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Kammer-Kollezski	1
rampart,	1
awaiting	1
what	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
a	1
necessary,	1
if	1
but	1
formal,	1
observance	1
of	1
the	1
proprieties--a	1
deputation.	1
	1
In	1
various	1
corners	1
of	1
Moscow	1
there	1
still	1
remained	1
a	1
few	1
people	1
aimlessly	1
moving	1
about,	1
following	1
their	1
old	1
habits	1
and	1
hardly	1
aware	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing.	1
	1
When	1
with	1
due	1
circumspection	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
empty,	1
he	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
his	1
informant,	1
turned	1
away,	1
and	1
silently	1
continued	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro.	1
	1
"My	1
carriage!"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
beside	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
on	1
duty	1
and	1
drove	1
into	1
the	1
suburb.	1
"Moscow	1
deserted!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"What	1
an	1
incredible	1
event!"	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
drive	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
but	1
put	1
up	1
at	1
an	1
inn	1
in	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
suburb.	1
	1
The	1
coup	1
de	1
theatre	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
off.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
troops	1
were	1
passing	1
through	1
Moscow	1
from	1
two	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night	1
till	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
and	1
bore	1
away	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
wounded	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
who	1
were	1
leaving.	1
	1
The	1
greatest	1
crush	1
during	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
took	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
Stone,	1
Moskva,	1
and	1
Yauza	1
bridges.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
troops,	1
dividing	1
into	1
two	1
parts	1
when	1
passing	1
around	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
were	1
thronging	1
the	1
Moskva	1
and	1
the	1
Stone	1
bridges,	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
soldiers,	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
stoppage	1
and	1
congestion,	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
bridges	1
and	1
slipped	1
stealthily	1
and	1
silently	1
past	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Vasili	1
the	1
Beatified	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
Borovitski	1
gate,	1
back	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
the	1
Red	1
Square	1
where	1
some	1
instinct	1
told	1
them	1
they	1
could	1
easily	1
take	1
things	1
not	1
belonging	1
to	1
them.	1
Crowds	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
seen	1
at	1
cheap	1
sales	1
filled	1
all	1
the	1
passages	1
and	1
alleys	1
of	1
the	1
Bazaar.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
dealers	1
with	1
voices	1
of	1
ingratiating	1
affability	1
inviting	1
customers	1
to	1
enter;	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
hawkers,	1
nor	1
the	1
usual	1
motley	1
crowd	1
of	1
female	1
purchasers--but	1
only	1
soldiers,	1
in	1
uniforms	1
and	1
overcoats	1
though	1
without	1
muskets,	1
entering	1
the	1
Bazaar	1
empty-handed	1
and	1
silently	1
making	1
their	1
way	1
out	1
through	1
its	1
passages	1
with	1
bundles.	1
Tradesmen	1
and	1
their	1
assistants	1
(of	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
few)	1
moved	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers	1
quite	1
bewildered.	1
They	1
unlocked	1
their	1
shops	1
and	1
locked	1
them	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
themselves	1
carried	1
goods	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
their	1
assistants.	1
On	1
the	1
square	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Bazaar	1
were	1
drummers	1
beating	1
the	1
muster	1
call.	1
But	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
drums	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
the	1
looting	1
soldiers	1
run	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
drum	1
as	1
formerly,	1
but	1
made	1
them,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
run	1
farther	1
away.	1
Among	1
the	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
shops	1
and	1
passages	1
some	1
men	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
gray	1
coats,	1
with	1
closely	1
shaven	1
heads.	1
Two	1
officers,	1
one	1
with	1
a	1
scarf	1
over	1
his	1
uniform	1
and	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
lean,	1
dark-gray	1
horse,	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
an	1
overcoat	1
and	1
on	1
foot,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Ilyinka	1
Street,	1
talking.	1
A	1
third	1
officer	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
"The	1
general	1
orders	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
out	1
at	1
once,	1
without	1
fail.	1
This	1
is	1
outrageous!	1
Half	1
the	1
men	1
have	1
dispersed."	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?...	1
Where?..."	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
three	1
infantrymen	1
without	1
muskets	1
who,	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
their	1
overcoats,	1
were	1
slipping	1
past	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
Bazaar	1
passage.	1
"Stop,	1
you	1
rascals!"	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
stop	1
them?"	1
replied	1
another	1
officer.	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
getting	1
them	1
together.	1
The	1
army	1
should	1
push	1
on	1
before	1
the	1
rest	1
bolt,	1
that's	1
all!"	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
one	1
push	1
on?	1
They	1
are	1
stuck	1
there,	1
wedged	1
on	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
don't	1
move.	1
Shouldn't	1
we	1
put	1
a	1
cordon	1
round	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
rest	1
from	1
running	1
away?"	1
	1
"Come,	1
go	1
in	1
there	1
and	1
drive	1
them	1
out!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
senior	1
officer.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
scarf	1
dismounted,	1
called	1
up	1
a	1
drummer,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
arcade.	1
Some	1
soldiers	1
started	1
running	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
group.	1
A	1
shopkeeper	1
with	1
red	1
pimples	1
on	1
his	1
cheeks	1
near	1
the	1
nose,	1
and	1
a	1
calm,	1
persistent,	1
calculating	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
plump	1
face,	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
ostentatiously	1
approached	1
the	1
officer,	1
swinging	1
his	1
arms.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
protect	1
us!	1
We	1
won't	1
grudge	1
trifles,	1
you	1
are	1
welcome	1
to	1
anything--we	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted!	1
Pray!...	1
I'll	1
fetch	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
cloth	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
honorable	1
gentleman,	1
or	1
even	1
two	1
pieces	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
For	1
we	1
feel	1
how	1
it	1
is;	1
but	1
what's	1
all	1
this--sheer	1
robbery!	1
If	1
you	1
please,	1
could	1
not	1
guards	1
be	1
placed	1
if	1
only	1
to	1
let	1
us	1
close	1
the	1
shop...."	1
	1
Several	1
shopkeepers	1
crowded	1
round	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
what	1
twaddle!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
thin,	1
stern-looking	1
man.	1
"When	1
one's	1
head	1
is	1
gone	1
one	1
doesn't	1
weep	1
for	1
one's	1
hair!	1
Take	1
what	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
like!"	1
And	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm	1
energetically	1
he	1
turned	1
sideways	1
to	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you,	1
Ivan	1
Sidorych,	1
to	1
talk,"	1
said	1
the	1
first	1
tradesman	1
angrily.	1
"Please	1
step	1
inside,	1
your	1
honor!"	1
	1
"Talk	1
indeed!"	1
cried	1
the	1
thin	1
one.	1
"In	1
my	1
three	1
shops	1
here	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rubles'	1
worth	1
of	1
goods.	1
Can	1
they	1
be	1
saved	1
when	1
the	1
army	1
has	1
gone?	1
Eh,	1
what	1
people!	1
'Against	1
God's	1
might	1
our	1
hands	1
can't	1
fight.'"	1
	1
"Come	1
inside,	1
your	1
honor!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
tradesman,	1
bowing.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
stood	1
perplexed	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
showed	1
indecision.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
my	1
business!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
and	1
strode	1
on	1
quickly	1
down	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
passages.	1
	1
From	1
one	1
open	1
shop	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
blows	1
and	1
vituperation,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
officer	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
gray	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
shaven	1
head	1
was	1
flung	1
out	1
violently.	1
	1
This	1
man,	1
bent	1
double,	1
rushed	1
past	1
the	1
tradesman	1
and	1
the	1
officer.	1
The	1
officer	1
pounced	1
on	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
shops,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
fearful	1
screams	1
reached	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
huge	1
crowd	1
on	1
the	1
Moskva	1
bridge	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
square.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
but	1
his	1
comrade	1
was	1
already	1
galloping	1
off	1
past	1
Vasili	1
the	1
Beatified	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
screams	1
came.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
mounted	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
after	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
bridge	1
he	1
saw	1
two	1
unlimbered	1
guns,	1
the	1
infantry	1
crossing	1
the	1
bridge,	1
several	1
overturned	1
carts,	1
and	1
frightened	1
and	1
laughing	1
faces	1
among	1
the	1
troops.	1
Beside	1
the	1
cannon	1
a	1
cart	1
was	1
standing	1
to	1
which	1
two	1
horses	1
were	1
harnessed.	1
Four	1
borzois	1
with	1
collars	1
were	1
pressing	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
wheels.	1
The	1
cart	1
was	1
loaded	1
high,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
top,	1
beside	1
a	1
child's	1
chair	1
with	1
its	1
legs	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
sat	1
a	1
peasant	1
woman	1
uttering	1
piercing	1
and	1
desperate	1
shrieks.	1
He	1
was	1
told	1
by	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers	1
that	1
the	1
screams	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
the	1
shrieks	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
were	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
General	1
Ermolov,	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
learning	1
that	1
soldiers	1
were	1
dispersing	1
among	1
the	1
shops	1
while	1
crowds	1
of	1
civilians	1
blocked	1
the	1
bridge,	1
had	1
ordered	1
two	1
guns	1
to	1
be	1
unlimbered	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
bridge.	1
The	1
crowd,	1
crushing	1
one	1
another,	1
upsetting	1
carts,	1
and	1
shouting	1
and	1
squeezing	1
desperately,	1
had	1
cleared	1
off	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
now	1
moving	1
forward.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XXII	1
	1
Meanwhile,	1
the	1
city	1
itself	1
was	1
deserted.	1
There	1
was	1
hardly	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
The	1
gates	1
and	1
shops	1
were	1
all	1
closed,	1
only	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
round	1
the	1
taverns	1
solitary	1
shouts	1
or	1
drunken	1
songs	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Nobody	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
footsteps	1
were	1
rarely	1
heard.	1
The	1
Povarskaya	1
was	1
quite	1
still	1
and	1
deserted.	1
The	1
huge	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
was	1
littered	1
with	1
wisps	1
of	1
hay	1
and	1
with	1
dung	1
from	1
the	1
horses,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
there.	1
In	1
the	1
great	1
drawing	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
with	1
all	1
it	1
contained,	1
were	1
two	1
people.	1
They	1
were	1
the	1
yard	1
porter	1
Ignat,	1
and	1
the	1
page	1
boy	1
Mishka,	1
Vasilich's	1
grandson	1
who	1
had	1
stayed	1
in	1
Moscow	1
with	1
his	1
grandfather.	1
Mishka	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
was	1
strumming	1
on	1
it	1
with	1
one	1
finger.	1
The	1
yard	1
porter,	1
his	1
arms	1
akimbo,	1
stood	1
smiling	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
before	1
the	1
large	1
mirror.	1
	1
"Isn't	1
it	1
fine,	1
eh,	1
Uncle	1
Ignat?"	1
said	1
the	1
boy,	1
suddenly	1
beginning	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
keyboard	1
with	1
both	1
hands.	1
	1
"Only	1
fancy!"	1
answered	1
Ignat,	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
broadening	1
grin	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
mirror.	1
	1
"Impudence!	1
Impudence!"	1
they	1
heard	1
behind	1
them	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
silently.	1
"How	1
he's	1
grinning,	1
the	1
fat	1
mug!	1
Is	1
that	1
what	1
you're	1
here	1
for?	1
Nothing's	1
cleared	1
away	1
down	1
there	1
and	1
Vasilich	1
is	1
worn	1
out.	1
Just	1
you	1
wait	1
a	1
bit!"	1
	1
Ignat	1
left	1
off	1
smiling,	1
adjusted	1
his	1
belt,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
meekly	1
downcast	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Aunt,	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
gently,"	1
said	1
the	1
boy.	1
	1
"I'll	1
give	1
you	1
something	1
gently,	1
you	1
monkey	1
you!"	1
cried	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
raising	1
her	1
arm	1
threateningly.	1
"Go	1
and	1
get	1
the	1
samovar	1
to	1
boil	1
for	1
your	1
grandfather."	1
	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
flicked	1
the	1
dust	1
off	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
closed	1
it,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
left	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
locked	1
its	1
main	1
door.	1
	1
Going	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
she	1
paused	1
to	1
consider	1
where	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
next-	1
-to	1
drink	1
tea	1
in	1
the	1
servants'	1
wing	1
with	1
Vasilich,	1
or	1
into	1
the	1
storeroom	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
what	1
still	1
lay	1
about.	1
	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
quick	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
quiet	1
street.	1
Someone	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
the	1
latch	1
rattled	1
as	1
someone	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
"Who	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
	1
"The	1
count--Count	1
Ilya	1
Andreevich	1
Rostov."	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
are	1
you?"	1
	1
"An	1
officer,	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
see	1
him,"	1
came	1
the	1
reply	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant,	1
well-bred	1
Russian	1
voice.	1
	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
opened	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
eighteen,	1
with	1
the	1
round	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
Rostov,	1
entered	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
"They	1
have	1
gone	1
away,	1
sir.	1
Went	1
away	1
yesterday	1
at	1
vespertime,"	1
said	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
cordially.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
officer	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
gateway,	1
as	1
if	1
hesitating	1
whether	1
to	1
enter	1
or	1
not,	1
clicked	1
his	1
tongue.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
how	1
annoying!"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
"I	1
should	1
have	1
come	1
yesterday....	1
Ah,	1
what	1
a	1
pity."	1
	1
Meanwhile,	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
was	1
attentively	1
and	1
sympathetically	1
examining	1
the	1
familiar	1
Rostov	1
features	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
face,	1
his	1
tattered	1
coat	1
and	1
trodden-down	1
boots.	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count	1
for?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh	1
well...	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
vexation	1
and	1
placed	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
gate	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
leave.	1
	1
He	1
again	1
paused	1
in	1
indecision.	1
	1
"You	1
see,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
said,	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
kinsman	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
kind	1
to	1
me.	1
As	1
you	1
see"	1
(he	1
glanced	1
with	1
an	1
amused	1
air	1
and	1
good-natured	1
smile	1
at	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
boots)	1
"my	1
things	1
are	1
worn	1
out	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
money,	1
so	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
count..."	1
	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
finish.	1
	1
"Just	1
wait	1
a	1
minute,	1
sir.	1
One	1
little	1
moment,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
officer	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
handle	1
she	1
turned	1
and,	1
hurrying	1
away	1
on	1
her	1
old	1
legs,	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
back	1
yard	1
to	1
the	1
servants'	1
quarters.	1
	1
While	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
was	1
running	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
the	1
officer	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
yard	1
gazing	1
at	1
his	1
worn-out	1
boots	1
with	1
lowered	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips.	1
"What	1
a	1
pity	1
I've	1
missed	1
Uncle!	1
What	1
a	1
nice	1
old	1
woman!	1
Where	1
has	1
she	1
run	1
off	1
to?	1
And	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
nearest	1
way	1
to	1
overtake	1
my	1
regiment,	1
which	1
must	1
by	1
now	1
be	1
getting	1
near	1
the	1
Rogozhski	1
gate?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
Just	1
then	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
appeared	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
yet	1
resolute	1
look,	1
carrying	1
a	1
rolled-up	1
check	1
kerchief	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
While	1
still	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
from	1
the	1
officer	1
she	1
unfolded	1
the	1
kerchief	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
a	1
white	1
twenty-	1
five-ruble	1
assignat	1
and	1
hastily	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"If	1
his	1
excellency	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
home,	1
as	1
a	1
kinsman	1
he	1
would	1
of	1
course...	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is..."	1
	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
grew	1
abashed	1
and	1
confused.	1
The	1
officer	1
did	1
not	1
decline,	1
but	1
took	1
the	1
note	1
quietly	1
and	1
thanked	1
her.	1
	1
"If	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
home..."	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
went	1
on	1
apologetically.	1
"Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
sir!	1
May	1
God	1
preserve	1
you!"	1
said	1
she,	1
bowing	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
Swaying	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
smiling	1
as	1
if	1
amused	1
at	1
himself,	1
the	1
officer	1
ran	1
almost	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
through	1
the	1
deserted	1
streets	1
toward	1
the	1
Yauza	1
bridge	1
to	1
overtake	1
his	1
regiment.	1
	1
But	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
closed	1
gate	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
moist	1
eyes,	1
pensively	1
swaying	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
feeling	1
an	1
unexpected	1
flow	1
of	1
motherly	1
tenderness	1
and	1
pity	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
young	1
officer.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIII	1
	1
From	1
an	1
unfinished	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Varvarka,	1
the	1
ground	1
floor	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
dramshop,	1
came	1
drunken	1
shouts	1
and	1
songs.	1
On	1
benches	1
round	1
the	1
tables	1
in	1
a	1
dirty	1
little	1
room	1
sat	1
some	1
ten	1
factory	1
hands.	1
Tipsy	1
and	1
perspiring,	1
with	1
dim	1
eyes	1
and	1
wide-open	1
mouths,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
laboriously	1
singing	1
some	1
song	1
or	1
other.	1
They	1
were	1
singing	1
discordantly,	1
arduously,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
effort,	1
evidently	1
not	1
because	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
sing,	1
but	1
because	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
show	1
they	1
were	1
drunk	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
spree.	1
One,	1
a	1
tall,	1
fair-	1
haired	1
lad	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
blue	1
coat,	1
was	1
standing	1
over	1
the	1
others.	1
His	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
fine	1
straight	1
nose	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
handsome	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
his	1
thin,	1
compressed,	1
twitching	1
lips	1
and	1
dull,	1
gloomy,	1
fixed	1
eyes.	1
Evidently	1
possessed	1
by	1
some	1
idea,	1
he	1
stood	1
over	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
singing,	1
and	1
solemnly	1
and	1
jerkily	1
flourished	1
above	1
their	1
heads	1
his	1
white	1
arm	1
with	1
the	1
sleeve	1
turned	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
elbow,	1
trying	1
unnaturally	1
to	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
dirty	1
fingers.	1
The	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
kept	1
slipping	1
down	1
and	1
he	1
always	1
carefully	1
rolled	1
it	1
up	1
again	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
hand,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
most	1
important	1
that	1
the	1
sinewy	1
white	1
arm	1
he	1
was	1
flourishing	1
should	1
be	1
bare.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
song	1
cries	1
were	1
heard,	1
and	1
fighting	1
and	1
blows	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
and	1
porch.	1
The	1
tall	1
lad	1
waved	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"Stop	1
it!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
peremptorily.	1
"There's	1
a	1
fight,	1
lads!"	1
And,	1
still	1
rolling	1
up	1
his	1
sleeve,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
The	1
factory	1
hands	1
followed	1
him.	1
These	1
men,	1
who	1
under	1
the	1
leadership	1
of	1
the	1
tall	1
lad	1
were	1
drinking	1
in	1
the	1
dramshop	1
that	1
morning,	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
publican	1
some	1
skins	1
from	1
the	1
factory	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
had	1
had	1
drink	1
served	1
them.	1
The	1
blacksmiths	1
from	1
a	1
neighboring	1
smithy,	1
hearing	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
revelry	1
in	1
the	1
tavern	1
and	1
supposing	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
broken	1
into,	1
wished	1
to	1
force	1
their	1
way	1
in	1
too	1
and	1
a	1
fight	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
had	1
resulted.	1
	1
The	1
publican	1
was	1
fighting	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
smiths	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
workmen	1
came	1
out	1
the	1
smith,	1
wrenching	1
himself	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
tavern	1
keeper,	1
fell	1
face	1
downward	1
on	1
the	1
pavement.	1
	1
Another	1
smith	1
tried	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
doorway,	1
pressing	1
against	1
the	1
publican	1
with	1
his	1
chest.	1
	1
The	1
lad	1
with	1
the	1
turned-up	1
sleeve	1
gave	1
the	1
smith	1
a	1
blow	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
cried	1
wildly:	1
"They're	1
fighting	1
us,	1
lads!"	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
first	1
smith	1
got	1
up	1
and,	1
scratching	1
his	1
bruised	1
face	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
bleed,	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
tearful	1
voice:	1
"Police!	1
Murder!...	1
They've	1
killed	1
a	1
man,	1
lads!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
gracious	1
me,	1
a	1
man	1
beaten	1
to	1
death--killed!..."	1
screamed	1
a	1
woman	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
gate	1
close	1
by.	1
	1
A	1
crowd	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
smith.	1
	1
"Haven't	1
you	1
robbed	1
people	1
enough--taking	1
their	1
last	1
shirts?"	1
said	1
a	1
voice	1
addressing	1
the	1
publican.	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
killed	1
a	1
man	1
for,	1
you	1
thief?"	1
	1
The	1
tall	1
lad,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
porch,	1
turned	1
his	1
bleared	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
publican	1
to	1
the	1
smith	1
and	1
back	1
again	1
as	1
if	1
considering	1
whom	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
fight	1
now.	1
	1
"Murderer!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
suddenly	1
to	1
the	1
publican.	1
"Bind	1
him,	1
lads!"	1
	1
"I	1
daresay	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
bind	1
me!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
publican,	1
pushing	1
away	1
the	1
men	1
advancing	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
snatching	1
his	1
cap	1
from	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
flung	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
As	1
if	1
this	1
action	1
had	1
some	1
mysterious	1
and	1
menacing	1
significance,	1
the	1
workmen	1
surrounding	1
the	1
publican	1
paused	1
in	1
indecision.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
the	1
law	1
very	1
well,	1
mates!	1
I'll	1
take	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
police.	1
You	1
think	1
I	1
won't	1
get	1
to	1
him?	1
Robbery	1
is	1
not	1
permitted	1
to	1
anybody	1
now	1
a	1
days!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
publican,	1
picking	1
up	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"Come	1
along	1
then!	1
Come	1
along	1
then!"	1
the	1
publican	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
young	1
fellow	1
repeated	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
they	1
moved	1
up	1
the	1
street	1
together.	1
	1
The	1
bloodstained	1
smith	1
went	1
beside	1
them.	1
The	1
factory	1
hands	1
and	1
others	1
followed	1
behind,	1
talking	1
and	1
shouting.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
Moroseyka,	1
opposite	1
a	1
large	1
house	1
with	1
closed	1
shutters	1
and	1
bearing	1
a	1
bootmaker's	1
signboard,	1
stood	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
thin,	1
worn-out,	1
gloomy-faced	1
bootmakers,	1
wearing	1
overalls	1
and	1
long	1
tattered	1
coats.	1
	1
"He	1
should	1
pay	1
folks	1
off	1
properly,"	1
a	1
thin	1
workingman,	1
with	1
frowning	1
brows	1
and	1
a	1
straggly	1
beard,	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"But	1
he's	1
sucked	1
our	1
blood	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
thinks	1
he's	1
quit	1
of	1
us.	1
He's	1
been	1
misleading	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
week	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
he's	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
this	1
pass	1
he's	1
made	1
off."	1
	1
On	1
seeing	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
man	1
the	1
workman	1
ceased	1
speaking,	1
and	1
with	1
eager	1
curiosity	1
all	1
the	1
bootmakers	1
joined	1
the	1
moving	1
crowd.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
folks	1
going?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
to	1
the	1
police,	1
of	1
course!"	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
beaten?"	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
think?	1
Look	1
what	1
folks	1
are	1
saying."	1
	1
Questions	1
and	1
answers	1
were	1
heard.	1
The	1
publican,	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
increased	1
crowd,	1
dropped	1
behind	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
tavern.	1
	1
The	1
tall	1
youth,	1
not	1
noticing	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
his	1
foe,	1
waved	1
his	1
bare	1
arm	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
incessantly,	1
attracting	1
general	1
attention	1
to	1
himself.	1
It	1
was	1
around	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
chiefly	1
crowded,	1
expecting	1
answers	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
occupied	1
all	1
their	1
minds.	1
	1
"He	1
must	1
keep	1
order,	1
keep	1
the	1
law,	1
that's	1
what	1
the	1
government	1
is	1
there	1
for.	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
right,	1
good	1
Christians?"	1
said	1
the	1
tall	1
youth,	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile.	1
"He	1
thinks	1
there's	1
no	1
government!	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
do	1
without	1
government?	1
Or	1
else	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
plenty	1
who'd	1
rob	1
us."	1
	1
"Why	1
talk	1
nonsense?"	1
rejoined	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
crowd.	1
"Will	1
they	1
give	1
up	1
Moscow	1
like	1
this?	1
They	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
for	1
fun,	1
and	1
you	1
believed	1
it!	1
Aren't	1
there	1
plenty	1
of	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
march?	1
Let	1
him	1
in,	1
indeed!	1
That's	1
what	1
the	1
government	1
is	1
for.	1
You'd	1
better	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
people	1
are	1
saying,"	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
mob	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
tall	1
youth.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
China-Town	1
a	1
smaller	1
group	1
of	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
round	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
frieze	1
coat	1
who	1
held	1
a	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"An	1
ukase,	1
they	1
are	1
reading	1
an	1
ukase!	1
Reading	1
an	1
ukase!"	1
cried	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
crowd,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
reader.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
coat	1
was	1
reading	1
the	1
broadsheet	1
of	1
August	1
31.	1
When	1
the	1
crowd	1
collected	1
round	1
him	1
he	1
seemed	1
confused,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
demand	1
of	1
the	1
tall	1
lad	1
who	1
had	1
pushed	1
his	1
way	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
tremulous	1
voice	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
sheet	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
"Early	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness,"	1
he	1
read	1
("Sirin	1
Highness,"	1
said	1
the	1
tall	1
fellow	1
with	1
a	1
triumphant	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
a	1
frown	1
on	1
his	1
brow),	1
"to	1
consult	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
act,	1
and	1
to	1
aid	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
exterminate	1
these	1
scoundrels.	1
We	1
too	1
will	1
take	1
part..."	1
the	1
reader	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
then	1
paused	1
("Do	1
you	1
see,"	1
shouted	1
the	1
youth	1
victoriously,	1
"he's	1
going	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
for	1
you...."),	1
"in	1
destroying	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
send	1
these	1
visitors	1
to	1
the	1
devil.	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
dinner,	1
and	1
we'll	1
set	1
to	1
work.	1
We	1
will	1
do,	1
completely	1
do,	1
and	1
undo	1
these	1
scoundrels."	1
	1
The	1
last	1
words	1
were	1
read	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
complete	1
silence.	1
The	1
tall	1
lad	1
hung	1
his	1
head	1
gloomily.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
understood	1
the	1
last	1
part.	1
In	1
particular,	1
the	1
words	1
"I	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
dinner,"	1
evidently	1
displeased	1
both	1
reader	1
and	1
audience.	1
The	1
people's	1
minds	1
were	1
tuned	1
to	1
a	1
high	1
pitch	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
too	1
simple	1
and	1
needlessly	1
comprehensible--it	1
was	1
what	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
and	1
therefore	1
was	1
what	1
an	1
ukase	1
emanating	1
from	1
the	1
highest	1
authority	1
should	1
not	1
say.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
stood	1
despondent	1
and	1
silent.	1
The	1
tall	1
youth	1
moved	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
swayed	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side.	1
	1
"We	1
should	1
ask	1
him...	1
that's	1
he	1
himself?"...	1
"Yes,	1
ask	1
him	1
indeed!...	1
Why	1
not?	1
He'll	1
explain"...	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
were	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
saying,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
attention	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
police	1
superintendent's	1
trap	1
which	1
drove	1
into	1
the	1
square	1
attended	1
by	1
two	1
mounted	1
dragoons.	1
	1
The	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
that	1
morning	1
by	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
orders	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
barges	1
and	1
had	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
that	1
matter	1
acquired	1
a	1
large	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
on	1
seeing	1
a	1
crowd	1
bearing	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
told	1
his	1
coachman	1
to	1
stop.	1
	1
"What	1
people	1
are	1
these?"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
men,	1
who	1
were	1
moving	1
singly	1
and	1
timidly	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
trap.	1
	1
"What	1
people	1
are	1
these?"	1
he	1
shouted	1
again,	1
receiving	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor..."	1
replied	1
the	1
shopman	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
coat,	1
"your	1
honor,	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
proclamation	1
of	1
his	1
highest	1
excellency	1
the	1
count,	1
they	1
desire	1
to	1
serve,	1
not	1
sparing	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
riot,	1
but	1
as	1
his	1
highest	1
excellence	1
said..."	1
	1
"The	1
count	1
has	1
not	1
left,	1
he	1
is	1
here,	1
and	1
an	1
order	1
will	1
be	1
issued	1
concerning	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police.	1
"Go	1
on!"	1
he	1
ordered	1
his	1
coachman.	1
	1
The	1
crowd	1
halted,	1
pressing	1
around	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
superintendent	1
had	1
said,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
departing	1
trap.	1
	1
The	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police	1
turned	1
round	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
look,	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
coachman,	1
and	1
his	1
horses	1
increased	1
their	1
speed.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
fraud,	1
lads!	1
Lead	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
him,	1
himself!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
tall	1
youth.	1
"Don't	1
let	1
him	1
go,	1
lads!	1
Let	1
him	1
answer	1
us!	1
Keep	1
him!"	1
shouted	1
different	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
dashed	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
trap.	1
	1
Following	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police	1
and	1
talking	1
loudly	1
the	1
crowd	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Lubyanka	1
Street.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
the	1
gentry	1
and	1
merchants	1
have	1
gone	1
away	1
and	1
left	1
us	1
to	1
perish.	1
Do	1
they	1
think	1
we're	1
dogs?"	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
were	1
heard	1
saying	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIV	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
after	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Kutuzov,	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow	1
mortified	1
and	1
offended	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
invited	1
to	1
attend	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
because	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
offer	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
city;	1
amazed	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
novel	1
outlook	1
revealed	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
camp,	1
which	1
treated	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
the	1
capital	1
and	1
its	1
patriotic	1
fervor	1
as	1
not	1
merely	1
secondary	1
but	1
quite	1
irrelevant	1
and	1
unimportant	1
matters.	1
Distressed,	1
offended,	1
and	1
surprised	1
by	1
all	1
this,	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
After	1
supper	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
without	1
undressing,	1
and	1
was	1
awakened	1
soon	1
after	1
midnight	1
by	1
a	1
courier	1
bringing	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Kutuzov.	1
This	1
letter	1
requested	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
send	1
police	1
officers	1
to	1
guide	1
the	1
troops	1
through	1
the	1
town,	1
as	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
retreating	1
to	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road	1
beyond	1
Moscow.	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
news	1
to	1
Rostopchin.	1
He	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
abandoned	1
not	1
merely	1
since	1
his	1
interview	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
with	1
Kutuzov	1
on	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
but	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
generals	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow	1
after	1
that	1
battle	1
had	1
said	1
unanimously	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
fight	1
another	1
battle,	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
the	1
government	1
property	1
had	1
been	1
removed	1
every	1
night,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
Rostopchin's	1
own	1
permission.	1
Yet	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
this	1
information	1
astonished	1
and	1
irritated	1
the	1
count,	1
coming	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
simple	1
note	1
with	1
an	1
order	1
from	1
Kutuzov,	1
and	1
received	1
at	1
night,	1
breaking	1
in	1
on	1
his	1
beauty	1
sleep.	1
	1
When	1
later	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
memoirs	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
explained	1
his	1
actions	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
actuated	1
by	1
two	1
important	1
considerations:	1
to	1
maintain	1
tranquillity	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
expedite	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants.	1
If	1
one	1
accepts	1
this	1
twofold	1
aim	1
all	1
Rostopchin's	1
actions	1
appear	1
irreproachable.	1
"Why	1
were	1
the	1
holy	1
relics,	1
the	1
arms,	1
ammunition,	1
gunpowder,	1
and	1
stores	1
of	1
corn	1
not	1
removed?	1
Why	1
were	1
thousands	1
of	1
inhabitants	1
deceived	1
into	1
believing	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
given	1
up--and	1
thereby	1
ruined?"	1
"To	1
preserve	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
the	1
city,"	1
explains	1
Count	1
Rostopchin.	1
"Why	1
were	1
bundles	1
of	1
useless	1
papers	1
from	1
the	1
government	1
offices,	1
and	1
Leppich's	1
balloon	1
and	1
other	1
articles	1
removed?"	1
"To	1
leave	1
the	1
town	1
empty,"	1
explains	1
Count	1
Rostopchin.	1
One	1
need	1
only	1
admit	1
that	1
public	1
tranquillity	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
and	1
any	1
action	1
finds	1
a	1
justification.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
terror	1
were	1
based	1
only	1
on	1
solicitude	1
for	1
public	1
tranquillity.	1
	1
On	1
what,	1
then,	1
was	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
fear	1
for	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
Moscow	1
based	1
in	1
1812?	1
What	1
reason	1
was	1
there	1
for	1
assuming	1
any	1
probability	1
of	1
an	1
uprising	1
in	1
the	1
city?	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
were	1
leaving	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
retreating	1
troops	1
were	1
filling	1
it.	1
Why	1
should	1
that	1
cause	1
the	1
masses	1
to	1
riot?	1
	1
Neither	1
in	1
Moscow	1
nor	1
anywhere	1
in	1
Russia	1
did	1
anything	1
resembling	1
an	1
insurrection	1
ever	1
occur	1
when	1
the	1
enemy	1
entered	1
a	1
town.	1
More	1
than	1
ten	1
thousand	1
people	1
were	1
still	1
in	1
Moscow	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
of	1
September,	1
and	1
except	1
for	1
a	1
mob	1
in	1
the	1
governor's	1
courtyard,	1
assembled	1
there	1
at	1
his	1
bidding,	1
nothing	1
happened.	1
It	1
is	1
obvious	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
even	1
less	1
reason	1
to	1
expect	1
a	1
disturbance	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
if	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
when	1
the	1
surrender	1
of	1
Moscow	1
became	1
certain	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
probable,	1
Rostopchin	1
instead	1
of	1
exciting	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
distributing	1
arms	1
and	1
broadsheets	1
had	1
taken	1
steps	1
to	1
remove	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
relics,	1
the	1
gunpowder,	1
munitions,	1
and	1
money,	1
and	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
population	1
plainly	1
that	1
the	1
town	1
would	1
be	1
abandoned.	1
	1
Rostopchin,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
patriotic	1
sentiments,	1
was	1
a	1
sanguine	1
and	1
impulsive	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
moved	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
administrative	1
circles	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
understanding	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
supposed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
guiding.	1
Ever	1
since	1
the	1
enemy's	1
entry	1
into	1
Smolensk	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
imagination	1
been	1
playing	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
director	1
of	1
the	1
popular	1
feeling	1
of	1
"the	1
heart	1
of	1
Russia."	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
it	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
(as	1
to	1
all	1
administrators)	1
that	1
he	1
controlled	1
the	1
external	1
actions	1
of	1
Moscow's	1
inhabitants,	1
but	1
he	1
also	1
thought	1
he	1
controlled	1
their	1
mental	1
attitude	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
his	1
broadsheets	1
and	1
posters,	1
written	1
in	1
a	1
coarse	1
tone	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
despise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
class	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
from	1
those	1
in	1
authority.	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
fine	1
role	1
of	1
leader	1
of	1
popular	1
feeling,	1
and	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
relinquishing	1
that	1
role	1
and	1
abandoning	1
Moscow	1
without	1
any	1
heroic	1
display	1
took	1
him	1
unawares	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
the	1
ground	1
slip	1
away	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
feet,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
positively	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
Though	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
coming,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
wholeheartedly	1
believe	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
abandoned,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
prepare	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
left	1
against	1
his	1
wishes.	1
If	1
the	1
government	1
offices	1
were	1
removed,	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
done	1
on	1
the	1
demand	1
of	1
officials	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
yielded	1
reluctantly.	1
He	1
was	1
absorbed	1
in	1
the	1
role	1
he	1
had	1
created	1
for	1
himself.	1
As	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
those	1
gifted	1
with	1
an	1
ardent	1
imagination,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
known	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
abandoned	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
only	1
with	1
his	1
intellect,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
adapt	1
himself	1
mentally	1
to	1
this	1
new	1
position	1
of	1
affairs.	1
	1
All	1
his	1
painstaking	1
and	1
energetic	1
activity	1
(in	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
was	1
useful	1
and	1
had	1
any	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
another	1
question)	1
had	1
been	1
simply	1
directed	1
toward	1
arousing	1
in	1
the	1
masses	1
his	1
own	1
feeling	1
of	1
patriotic	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
events	1
assumed	1
their	1
true	1
historical	1
character,	1
when	1
expressing	1
hatred	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
in	1
words	1
proved	1
insufficient,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
possible	1
to	1
express	1
that	1
hatred	1
by	1
fighting	1
a	1
battle,	1
when	1
self-	1
confidence	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
avail	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
question	1
before	1
Moscow,	1
when	1
the	1
whole	1
population	1
streamed	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow	1
as	1
one	1
man,	1
abandoning	1
their	1
belongings	1
and	1
proving	1
by	1
that	1
negative	1
action	1
all	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
their	1
national	1
feeling,	1
then	1
the	1
role	1
chosen	1
by	1
Rostopchin	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
senseless.	1
He	1
unexpectedly	1
felt	1
himself	1
ridiculous,	1
weak,	1
and	1
alone,	1
with	1
no	1
ground	1
to	1
stand	1
on.	1
	1
When,	1
awakened	1
from	1
his	1
sleep,	1
he	1
received	1
that	1
cold,	1
peremptory	1
note	1
from	1
Kutuzov,	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
more	1
irritated	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
blame.	1
All	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
specially	1
put	1
in	1
charge	1
of,	1
the	1
state	1
property	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
removed,	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
possible	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it	1
away.	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it?	1
Who	1
has	1
let	1
things	1
come	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pass?"	1
he	1
ruminated.	1
"Not	1
I,	1
of	1
course.	1
I	1
had	1
everything	1
ready.	1
I	1
had	1
Moscow	1
firmly	1
in	1
hand.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
to!	1
Villains!	1
Traitors!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
without	1
clearly	1
defining	1
who	1
the	1
villains	1
and	1
traitors	1
were,	1
but	1
feeling	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
hate	1
those	1
traitors	1
whoever	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
the	1
false	1
and	1
ridiculous	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
night	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
issued	1
orders,	1
for	1
which	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
Those	1
about	1
him	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
the	1
count	1
so	1
morose	1
and	1
irritable.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
the	1
Director	1
of	1
the	1
Registrar's	1
Department	1
has	1
sent	1
for	1
instructions...	1
From	1
the	1
Consistory,	1
from	1
the	1
Senate,	1
from	1
the	1
University,	1
from	1
the	1
Foundling	1
Hospital,	1
the	1
Suffragan	1
has	1
sent...	1
asking	1
for	1
information....	1
What	1
are	1
your	1
orders	1
about	1
the	1
Fire	1
Brigade?	1
From	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
prison...	1
from	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
the	1
lunatic	1
asylum..."	1
All	1
night	1
long	1
such	1
announcements	1
were	1
continually	1
being	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
To	1
all	1
these	1
inquiries	1
he	1
gave	1
brief	1
and	1
angry	1
replies	1
indicating	1
that	1
orders	1
from	1
him	1
were	1
not	1
now	1
needed,	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
affair,	1
carefully	1
prepared	1
by	1
him,	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
ruined	1
by	1
somebody,	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
somebody	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
might	1
happen.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
tell	1
that	1
blockhead,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
from	1
the	1
Registrar's	1
Department,	1
"that	1
he	1
should	1
remain	1
to	1
guard	1
his	1
documents.	1
Now	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
asking	1
silly	1
questions	1
about	1
the	1
Fire	1
Brigade?	1
They	1
have	1
horses,	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
off	1
to	1
Vladimir,	1
and	1
not	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
French."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
the	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
has	1
come:	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
commands?"	1
	1
"My	1
commands?	1
Let	1
them	1
go	1
away,	1
that's	1
all....	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
lunatics	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
town.	1
When	1
lunatics	1
command	1
our	1
armies	1
God	1
evidently	1
means	1
these	1
other	1
madmen	1
to	1
be	1
free."	1
	1
In	1
reply	1
to	1
an	1
inquiry	1
about	1
the	1
convicts	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
shouted	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
governor:	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
two	1
battalions--which	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
got--for	1
a	1
convoy?	1
Release	1
them,	1
that's	1
all	1
about	1
it!"	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
political	1
prisoners,	1
Meshkov,	1
Vereshchagin..."	1
	1
"Vereshchagin!	1
Hasn't	1
he	1
been	1
hanged	1
yet?"	1
shouted	1
Rostopchin.	1
"Bring	1
him	1
to	1
me!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXV	1
	1
Toward	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
already	1
moving	1
through	1
Moscow,	1
nobody	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
any	1
more	1
for	1
instructions.	1
Those	1
who	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
were	1
going	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord,	1
those	1
who	1
remained	1
behind	1
decided	1
for	1
themselves	1
what	1
they	1
must	1
do.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
ordered	1
his	1
carriage	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
drive	1
to	1
Sokolniki,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
with	1
folded	1
hands,	1
morose,	1
sallow,	1
and	1
taciturn.	1
	1
In	1
quiet	1
and	1
untroubled	1
times	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
every	1
administrator	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
by	1
his	1
efforts	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
population	1
under	1
his	1
rule	1
is	1
kept	1
going,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
indispensable	1
every	1
administrator	1
finds	1
the	1
chief	1
reward	1
of	1
his	1
labor	1
and	1
efforts.	1
While	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
history	1
remains	1
calm	1
the	1
ruler-administrator	1
in	1
his	1
frail	1
bark,	1
holding	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
boat	1
hook	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
himself	1
moving,	1
naturally	1
imagines	1
that	1
his	1
efforts	1
move	1
the	1
ship	1
he	1
is	1
holding	1
on	1
to.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
a	1
storm	1
arises	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
begins	1
to	1
heave	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
move,	1
such	1
a	1
delusion	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
possible.	1
The	1
ship	1
moves	1
independently	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
enormous	1
motion,	1
the	1
boat	1
hook	1
no	1
longer	1
reaches	1
the	1
moving	1
vessel,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
the	1
administrator,	1
instead	1
of	1
appearing	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
power,	1
becomes	1
an	1
insignificant,	1
useless,	1
feeble	1
man.	1
	1
Rostopchin	1
felt	1
this,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
which	1
exasperated	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police,	1
whom	1
the	1
crowd	1
had	1
stopped,	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
an	1
adjutant	1
who	1
informed	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
harnessed.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
pale,	1
and	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police,	1
after	1
reporting	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
executed	1
the	1
instructions	1
he	1
had	1
received,	1
informed	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
an	1
immense	1
crowd	1
had	1
collected	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
Without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
Rostopchin	1
rose	1
and	1
walked	1
hastily	1
to	1
his	1
light,	1
luxurious	1
drawing	1
room,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
balcony	1
door,	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
handle,	1
let	1
it	1
go	1
again,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
better	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd.	1
The	1
tall	1
lad	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
front,	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
saying	1
something	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
look.	1
The	1
blood-	1
stained	1
smith	1
stood	1
beside	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
face.	1
A	1
drone	1
of	1
voices	1
was	1
audible	1
through	1
the	1
closed	1
window.	1
	1
"Is	1
my	1
carriage	1
ready?"	1
asked	1
Rostopchin,	1
stepping	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
"It	1
is,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
Rostopchin	1
went	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
balcony	1
door.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
do	1
they	1
want?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
they	1
say	1
they	1
have	1
got	1
ready,	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
orders,	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
they	1
shouted	1
something	1
about	1
treachery.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
turbulent	1
crowd,	1
your	1
excellency--I	1
hardly	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
it.	1
Your	1
excellency,	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
suggest..."	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
go.	1
I	1
don't	1
need	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
to	1
do!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rostopchin	1
angrily.	1
	1
He	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
balcony	1
door	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
Russia!	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
me!"	1
thought	1
he,	1
full	1
of	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
fury	1
that	1
welled	1
up	1
within	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
someone	1
to	1
whom	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
might	1
be	1
attributed.	1
As	1
often	1
happens	1
with	1
passionate	1
people,	1
he	1
was	1
mastered	1
by	1
anger	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
seeking	1
an	1
object	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
vent	1
it.	1
"Here	1
is	1
that	1
mob,	1
the	1
dregs	1
of	1
the	1
people,"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
crowd:	1
"this	1
rabble	1
they	1
have	1
roused	1
by	1
their	1
folly!	1
They	1
want	1
a	1
victim,"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
tall	1
lad	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm.	1
And	1
this	1
thought	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
himself	1
desired	1
a	1
victim,	1
something	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
vent	1
his	1
rage.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
carriage	1
ready?"	1
he	1
asked	1
again.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
What	1
are	1
your	1
orders	1
about	1
Vereshchagin?	1
He	1
is	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
porch,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rostopchin,	1
as	1
if	1
struck	1
by	1
an	1
unexpected	1
recollection.	1
	1
And	1
rapidly	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
went	1
resolutely	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
balcony.	1
The	1
talking	1
instantly	1
ceased,	1
hats	1
and	1
caps	1
were	1
doffed,	1
and	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
raised	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"Good	1
morning,	1
lads!"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
briskly	1
and	1
loudly.	1
"Thank	1
you	1
for	1
coming.	1
I'll	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
first	1
settle	1
with	1
the	1
villain.	1
We	1
must	1
punish	1
the	1
villain	1
who	1
has	1
caused	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
Wait	1
for	1
me!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
count	1
stepped	1
as	1
briskly	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
A	1
murmur	1
of	1
approbation	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
crowd.	1
"He'll	1
settle	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
villains,	1
you'll	1
see!	1
And	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
French...	1
He'll	1
show	1
you	1
what	1
law	1
is!"	1
the	1
mob	1
were	1
saying	1
as	1
if	1
reproving	1
one	1
another	1
for	1
their	1
lack	1
of	1
confidence.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
an	1
officer	1
came	1
hurriedly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
door,	1
gave	1
an	1
order,	1
and	1
the	1
dragoons	1
formed	1
up	1
in	1
line.	1
The	1
crowd	1
moved	1
eagerly	1
from	1
the	1
balcony	1
toward	1
the	1
porch.	1
Rostopchin,	1
coming	1
out	1
there	1
with	1
quick	1
angry	1
steps,	1
looked	1
hastily	1
around	1
as	1
if	1
seeking	1
someone.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?"	1
he	1
inquired.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
coming	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
between	1
two	1
dragoons.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
thin	1
neck,	1
and	1
his	1
head,	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
half	1
shaved,	1
was	1
again	1
covered	1
by	1
short	1
hair.	1
This	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
threadbare	1
blue	1
cloth	1
coat	1
lined	1
with	1
fox	1
fur,	1
that	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
smart,	1
and	1
dirty	1
hempen	1
convict	1
trousers,	1
over	1
which	1
were	1
pulled	1
his	1
thin,	1
dirty,	1
trodden-down	1
boots.	1
On	1
his	1
thin,	1
weak	1
legs	1
were	1
heavy	1
chains	1
which	1
hampered	1
his	1
irresolute	1
movements.	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Rostopchin,	1
hurriedly	1
turning	1
away	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
fur-lined	1
coat	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
step	1
of	1
the	1
porch.	1
"Put	1
him	1
there."	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
clattering	1
chains	1
stepped	1
clumsily	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
indicated,	1
holding	1
away	1
with	1
one	1
finger	1
the	1
coat	1
collar	1
which	1
chafed	1
his	1
neck,	1
turned	1
his	1
long	1
neck	1
twice	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that,	1
sighed,	1
and	1
submissively	1
folded	1
before	1
him	1
his	1
thin	1
hands,	1
unused	1
to	1
work.	1
	1
For	1
several	1
seconds	1
while	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
taking	1
his	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
the	1
silence	1
continued.	1
Only	1
among	1
the	1
back	1
rows	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
pressing	1
toward	1
the	1
one	1
spot,	1
could	1
sighs,	1
groans,	1
and	1
the	1
shuffling	1
of	1
feet	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
While	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
Rostopchin	1
stood	1
frowning	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"Lads!"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
metallic	1
ring	1
in	1
his	1
voice.	1
"This	1
man,	1
Vereshchagin,	1
is	1
the	1
scoundrel	1
by	1
whose	1
doing	1
Moscow	1
is	1
perishing."	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
fur-lined	1
coat,	1
stooping	1
a	1
little,	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
submissive	1
attitude,	1
his	1
fingers	1
clasped	1
before	1
him.	1
His	1
emaciated	1
young	1
face,	1
disfigured	1
by	1
the	1
half-shaven	1
head,	1
hung	1
down	1
hopelessly.	1
At	1
the	1
count's	1
first	1
words	1
he	1
raised	1
it	1
slowly	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
eye.	1
But	1
Rostopchin	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
him.	1
A	1
vein	1
in	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
long	1
thin	1
neck	1
swelled	1
like	1
a	1
cord	1
and	1
went	1
blue	1
behind	1
the	1
ear,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
his	1
face	1
flushed.	1
	1
All	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
him.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
crowd,	1
and	1
rendered	1
more	1
hopeful	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
he	1
read	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
there,	1
he	1
smiled	1
sadly	1
and	1
timidly,	1
and	1
lowering	1
his	1
head	1
shifted	1
his	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
step.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
betrayed	1
his	1
Tsar	1
and	1
his	1
country,	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
over	1
to	1
Bonaparte.	1
He	1
alone	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
has	1
disgraced	1
the	1
Russian	1
name,	1
he	1
has	1
caused	1
Moscow	1
to	1
perish,"	1
said	1
Rostopchin	1
in	1
a	1
sharp,	1
even	1
voice,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
he	1
glanced	1
down	1
at	1
Vereshchagin	1
who	1
continued	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
submissive	1
attitude.	1
As	1
if	1
inflamed	1
by	1
the	1
sight,	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
addressed	1
the	1
people,	1
almost	1
shouting:	1
	1
"Deal	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
fit!	1
I	1
hand	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
crowd	1
remained	1
silent	1
and	1
only	1
pressed	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
To	1
keep	1
one	1
another	1
back,	1
to	1
breathe	1
in	1
that	1
stifling	1
atmosphere,	1
to	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
stir,	1
and	1
to	1
await	1
something	1
unknown,	1
uncomprehended,	1
and	1
terrible,	1
was	1
becoming	1
unbearable.	1
Those	1
standing	1
in	1
front,	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
before	1
them,	1
all	1
stood	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
and	1
mouths,	1
straining	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
strength,	1
and	1
held	1
back	1
the	1
crowd	1
that	1
was	1
pushing	1
behind	1
them.	1
	1
"Beat	1
him!...	1
Let	1
the	1
traitor	1
perish	1
and	1
not	1
disgrace	1
the	1
Russian	1
name!"	1
shouted	1
Rostopchin.	1
"Cut	1
him	1
down.	1
I	1
command	1
it."	1
	1
Hearing	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
words	1
as	1
the	1
angry	1
tone	1
of	1
Rostopchin's	1
voice,	1
the	1
crowd	1
moaned	1
and	1
heaved	1
forward,	1
but	1
again	1
paused.	1
	1
"Count!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
timid	1
yet	1
theatrical	1
voice	1
of	1
Vereshchagin	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
momentary	1
silence	1
that	1
ensued,	1
"Count!	1
One	1
God	1
is	1
above	1
us	1
both...."	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
thick	1
vein	1
in	1
his	1
thin	1
neck	1
filled	1
with	1
blood	1
and	1
the	1
color	1
rapidly	1
came	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
what	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Cut	1
him	1
down!	1
I	1
command	1
it..."	1
shouted	1
Rostopchin,	1
suddenly	1
growing	1
pale	1
like	1
Vereshchagin.	1
	1
"Draw	1
sabers!"	1
cried	1
the	1
dragoon	1
officer,	1
drawing	1
his	1
own.	1
	1
Another	1
still	1
stronger	1
wave	1
flowed	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
reaching	1
the	1
front	1
ranks	1
carried	1
it	1
swaying	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
porch.	1
The	1
tall	1
youth,	1
with	1
a	1
stony	1
look	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
rigid	1
and	1
uplifted	1
arm,	1
stood	1
beside	1
Vereshchagin.	1
	1
"Saber	1
him!"	1
the	1
dragoon	1
officer	1
almost	1
whispered.	1
	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
his	1
face	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
distorted	1
with	1
fury,	1
struck	1
Vereshchagin	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
blunt	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
saber.	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
cried	1
Vereshchagin	1
in	1
meek	1
surprise,	1
looking	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
glance	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
understanding	1
why	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
to	1
him.	1
A	1
similar	1
moan	1
of	1
surprise	1
and	1
horror	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
crowd.	1
"O	1
Lord!"	1
exclaimed	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
voice.	1
	1
But	1
after	1
the	1
exclamation	1
of	1
surprise	1
that	1
had	1
escaped	1
from	1
Vereshchagin	1
he	1
uttered	1
a	1
plaintive	1
cry	1
of	1
pain,	1
and	1
that	1
cry	1
was	1
fatal.	1
The	1
barrier	1
of	1
human	1
feeling,	1
strained	1
to	1
the	1
utmost,	1
that	1
had	1
held	1
the	1
crowd	1
in	1
check	1
suddenly	1
broke.	1
The	1
crime	1
had	1
begun	1
and	1
must	1
now	1
be	1
completed.	1
The	1
plaintive	1
moan	1
of	1
reproach	1
was	1
drowned	1
by	1
the	1
threatening	1
and	1
angry	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
Like	1
the	1
seventh	1
and	1
last	1
wave	1
that	1
shatters	1
a	1
ship,	1
that	1
last	1
irresistible	1
wave	1
burst	1
from	1
the	1
rear	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
front	1
ranks,	1
carrying	1
them	1
off	1
their	1
feet	1
and	1
engulfing	1
them	1
all.	1
The	1
dragoon	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
repeat	1
his	1
blow.	1
Vereshchagin	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
horror,	1
covering	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
crowd.	1
The	1
tall	1
youth,	1
against	1
whom	1
he	1
stumbled,	1
seized	1
his	1
thin	1
neck	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
and,	1
yelling	1
wildly,	1
fell	1
with	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
pressing,	1
struggling	1
crowd.	1
	1
Some	1
beat	1
and	1
tore	1
at	1
Vereshchagin,	1
others	1
at	1
the	1
tall	1
youth.	1
And	1
the	1
screams	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
trampled	1
on	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
rescue	1
the	1
tall	1
lad	1
only	1
increased	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
the	1
dragoons	1
could	1
extricate	1
the	1
bleeding	1
youth,	1
beaten	1
almost	1
to	1
death.	1
And	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
despite	1
the	1
feverish	1
haste	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
mob	1
tried	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
begun,	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
hitting,	1
throttling,	1
and	1
tearing	1
at	1
Vereshchagin	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
for	1
the	1
crowd	1
pressed	1
from	1
all	1
sides,	1
swaying	1
as	1
one	1
mass	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
and	1
rendering	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
either	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
or	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
"Hit	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
ax,	1
eh!...	1
Crushed?...	1
Traitor,	1
he	1
sold	1
Christ....	1
Still	1
alive...	1
tenacious...	1
serves	1
him	1
right!	1
Torture	1
serves	1
a	1
thief	1
right.	1
Use	1
the	1
hatchet!...	1
What--still	1
alive?"	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
the	1
victim	1
ceased	1
to	1
struggle	1
and	1
his	1
cries	1
changed	1
to	1
a	1
long-	1
drawn,	1
measured	1
death	1
rattle	1
did	1
the	1
crowd	1
around	1
his	1
prostrate,	1
bleeding	1
corpse	1
begin	1
rapidly	1
to	1
change	1
places.	1
Each	1
one	1
came	1
up,	1
glanced	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done,	1
and	1
with	1
horror,	1
reproach,	1
and	1
astonishment	1
pushed	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord!	1
The	1
people	1
are	1
like	1
wild	1
beasts!	1
How	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
alive?"	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
saying.	1
"Quite	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
too...	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
merchant's	1
son.	1
What	1
men!...	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
he's	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
one....	1
How	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
one?...	1
O	1
Lord!	1
And	1
there's	1
another	1
has	1
been	1
beaten	1
too--they	1
say	1
he's	1
nearly	1
done	1
for....	1
Oh,	1
the	1
people...	1
Aren't	1
they	1
afraid	1
of	1
sinning?..."	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
mob	1
now,	1
looking	1
with	1
pained	1
distress	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
with	1
its	1
long,	1
thin,	1
half-severed	1
neck	1
and	1
its	1
livid	1
face	1
stained	1
with	1
blood	1
and	1
dust.	1
	1
A	1
painstaking	1
police	1
officer,	1
considering	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
corpse	1
in	1
his	1
excellency's	1
courtyard	1
unseemly,	1
told	1
the	1
dragoons	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
away.	1
Two	1
dragoons	1
took	1
it	1
by	1
its	1
distorted	1
legs	1
and	1
dragged	1
it	1
along	1
the	1
ground.	1
The	1
gory,	1
dust-stained,	1
half-shaven	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
long	1
neck	1
trailed	1
twisting	1
along	1
the	1
ground.	1
The	1
crowd	1
shrank	1
back	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Vereshchagin	1
fell	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
closed	1
in	1
with	1
savage	1
yells	1
and	1
swayed	1
about	1
him,	1
Rostopchin	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
pale	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
entrance	1
where	1
his	1
carriage	1
awaited	1
him,	1
went	1
with	1
hurried	1
steps	1
and	1
bent	1
head,	1
not	1
knowing	1
where	1
and	1
why,	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
rooms	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor.	1
The	1
count's	1
face	1
was	1
white	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
the	1
feverish	1
twitching	1
of	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw.	1
	1
"This	1
way,	1
your	1
excellency...	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?...	1
This	1
way,	1
please..."	1
said	1
a	1
trembling,	1
frightened	1
voice	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
reply	1
and,	1
turning	1
obediently,	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
indicated.	1
At	1
the	1
back	1
entrance	1
stood	1
his	1
caleche.	1
The	1
distant	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
yelling	1
crowd	1
was	1
audible	1
even	1
there.	1
He	1
hastily	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
coachman	1
to	1
drive	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
house	1
in	1
Sokolniki.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
Myasnitski	1
Street	1
and	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
hear	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
mob,	1
the	1
count	1
began	1
to	1
repent.	1
He	1
remembered	1
with	1
dissatisfaction	1
the	1
agitation	1
and	1
fear	1
he	1
had	1
betrayed	1
before	1
his	1
subordinates.	1
"The	1
mob	1
is	1
terrible--disgusting,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
French.	1
"They	1
are	1
like	1
wolves	1
whom	1
nothing	1
but	1
flesh	1
can	1
appease."	1
"Count!	1
One	1
God	1
is	1
above	1
us	1
both!"--Vereshchagin's	1
words	1
suddenly	1
recurred	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
shiver	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
back.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
momentary	1
feeling	1
and	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
smiled	1
disdainfully	1
at	1
himself.	1
"I	1
had	1
other	1
duties,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"The	1
people	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
appeased.	1
Many	1
other	1
victims	1
have	1
perished	1
and	1
are	1
perishing	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good"--and	1
he	1
began	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
social	1
duties	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
himself--not	1
himself	1
as	1
Theodore	1
Vasilyevich	1
Rostopchin	1
(he	1
fancied	1
that	1
Theodore	1
Vasilyevich	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
sacrificing	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good)	1
but	1
himself	1
as	1
governor,	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
authority	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar.	1
"Had	1
I	1
been	1
simply	1
Theodore	1
Vasilyevich	1
my	1
course	1
of	1
action	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
quite	1
different,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
safeguard	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
dignity	1
as	1
commander-in-chief."	1
	1
Lightly	1
swaying	1
on	1
the	1
flexible	1
springs	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
hearing	1
the	1
terrible	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
crowd,	1
Rostopchin	1
grew	1
physically	1
calm	1
and,	1
as	1
always	1
happens,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
became	1
physically	1
tranquil	1
his	1
mind	1
devised	1
reasons	1
why	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
mentally	1
tranquil	1
too.	1
The	1
thought	1
which	1
tranquillized	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
new	1
one.	1
Since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
and	1
men	1
have	1
killed	1
one	1
another	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
ever	1
committed	1
such	1
a	1
crime	1
against	1
his	1
fellow	1
man	1
without	1
comforting	1
himself	1
with	1
this	1
same	1
idea.	1
This	1
idea	1
is	1
le	1
bien	1
public,	1
the	1
hypothetical	1
welfare	1
of	1
other	1
people.	1
	1
To	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
swayed	1
by	1
passion	1
that	1
welfare	1
is	1
never	1
certain,	1
but	1
he	1
who	1
commits	1
such	1
a	1
crime	1
always	1
knows	1
just	1
where	1
that	1
welfare	1
lies.	1
And	1
Rostopchin	1
now	1
knew	1
it.	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
his	1
reason	1
not	1
reproach	1
him	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done,	1
but	1
he	1
even	1
found	1
cause	1
for	1
self-satisfaction	1
in	1
having	1
so	1
successfully	1
contrived	1
to	1
avail	1
himself	1
of	1
a	1
convenient	1
opportunity	1
to	1
punish	1
a	1
criminal	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
pacify	1
the	1
mob.	1
	1
"Vereshchagin	1
was	1
tried	1
and	1
condemned	1
to	1
death,"	1
thought	1
Rostopchin	1
(though	1
the	1
Senate	1
had	1
only	1
condemned	1
Vereshchagin	1
to	1
hard	1
labor),	1
"he	1
was	1
a	1
traitor	1
and	1
a	1
spy.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
unpunished	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
killed	1
two	1
birds	1
with	1
one	1
stone:	1
to	1
appease	1
the	1
mob	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
victim	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
punished	1
a	1
miscreant."	1
	1
Having	1
reached	1
his	1
country	1
house	1
and	1
begun	1
to	1
give	1
orders	1
about	1
domestic	1
arrangements,	1
the	1
count	1
grew	1
quite	1
tranquil.	1
	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
he	1
was	1
driving	1
with	1
his	1
fast	1
horses	1
across	1
the	1
Sokolniki	1
field,	1
no	1
longer	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
but	1
considering	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
come.	1
He	1
was	1
driving	1
to	1
the	1
Yauza	1
bridge	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
was.	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
mentally	1
preparing	1
the	1
angry	1
and	1
stinging	1
reproaches	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
address	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
for	1
his	1
deception.	1
He	1
would	1
make	1
that	1
foxy	1
old	1
courtier	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
responsibility	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
calamities	1
that	1
would	1
follow	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
Russia	1
(as	1
Rostopchin	1
regarded	1
it)	1
would	1
fall	1
upon	1
his	1
doting	1
old	1
head.	1
Planning	1
beforehand	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
Rostopchin	1
turned	1
angrily	1
in	1
his	1
caleche	1
and	1
gazed	1
sternly	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side.	1
	1
The	1
Sokolniki	1
field	1
was	1
deserted.	1
Only	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
almshouse	1
and	1
the	1
lunatic	1
asylum,	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
some	1
people	1
in	1
white	1
and	1
others	1
like	1
them	1
walking	1
singly	1
across	1
the	1
field	1
shouting	1
and	1
gesticulating.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
running	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
carriage,	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
himself,	1
his	1
coachman,	1
and	1
his	1
dragoons	1
looked	1
with	1
vague	1
horror	1
and	1
curiosity	1
at	1
these	1
released	1
lunatics	1
and	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
one	1
running	1
toward	1
them.	1
	1
Swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
on	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
legs	1
in	1
his	1
fluttering	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
this	1
lunatic	1
was	1
running	1
impetuously,	1
his	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
on	1
Rostopchin,	1
shouting	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
and	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
stop.	1
The	1
lunatic's	1
solemn,	1
gloomy	1
face	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
yellow,	1
with	1
its	1
beard	1
growing	1
in	1
uneven	1
tufts.	1
His	1
black,	1
agate	1
pupils	1
with	1
saffron-	1
yellow	1
whites	1
moved	1
restlessly	1
near	1
the	1
lower	1
eyelids.	1
	1
"Stop!	1
Pull	1
up,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!"	1
he	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
piercing	1
voice,	1
and	1
again	1
shouted	1
something	1
breathlessly	1
with	1
emphatic	1
intonations	1
and	1
gestures.	1
	1
Coming	1
abreast	1
of	1
the	1
caleche	1
he	1
ran	1
beside	1
it.	1
	1
"Thrice	1
have	1
they	1
slain	1
me,	1
thrice	1
have	1
I	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
They	1
stoned	1
me,	1
crucified	1
me...	1
I	1
shall	1
rise...	1
shall	1
rise...	1
shall	1
rise.	1
They	1
have	1
torn	1
my	1
body.	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
will	1
be	1
overthrown...	1
Thrice	1
will	1
I	1
overthrow	1
it	1
and	1
thrice	1
re-establish	1
it!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
higher	1
and	1
higher.	1
	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
suddenly	1
grew	1
pale	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
the	1
crowd	1
closed	1
in	1
on	1
Vereshchagin.	1
He	1
turned	1
away.	1
"Go	1
fas...	1
faster!"	1
he	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
to	1
his	1
coachman.	1
The	1
caleche	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
horses	1
could	1
draw	1
it,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
still	1
heard	1
the	1
insane	1
despairing	1
screams	1
growing	1
fainter	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
while	1
his	1
eyes	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
astonished,	1
frightened,	1
bloodstained	1
face	1
of	1
"the	1
traitor"	1
in	1
the	1
fur-lined	1
coat.	1
	1
Recent	1
as	1
that	1
mental	1
picture	1
was,	1
Rostopchin	1
already	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
cut	1
deep	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
drawn	1
blood.	1
Even	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
clearly	1
that	1
the	1
gory	1
trace	1
of	1
that	1
recollection	1
would	1
not	1
pass	1
with	1
time,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
terrible	1
memory	1
would,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
dwell	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
ever	1
more	1
cruelly	1
and	1
painfully	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
seemed	1
still	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
words:	1
"Cut	1
him	1
down!	1
I	1
command	1
it...."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
I	1
utter	1
those	1
words?	1
It	1
was	1
by	1
some	1
accident	1
I	1
said	1
them....	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
them,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"And	1
then	1
nothing	1
would	1
have	1
happened."	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
frightened	1
and	1
then	1
infuriated	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
dragoon	1
who	1
dealt	1
the	1
blow,	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
silent,	1
timid	1
reproach	1
that	1
boy	1
in	1
the	1
fur-lined	1
coat	1
had	1
turned	1
upon	1
him.	1
"But	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sake.	1
I	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
act	1
that	1
way....	1
The	1
mob,	1
the	1
traitor...	1
the	1
public	1
welfare,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
Troops	1
were	1
still	1
crowding	1
at	1
the	1
Yauza	1
bridge.	1
It	1
was	1
hot.	1
Kutuzov,	1
dejected	1
and	1
frowning,	1
sat	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
by	1
the	1
bridge	1
toying	1
with	1
his	1
whip	1
in	1
the	1
sand	1
when	1
a	1
caleche	1
dashed	1
up	1
noisily.	1
A	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
general's	1
uniform	1
with	1
plumes	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
French.	1
It	1
was	1
Count	1
Rostopchin.	1
He	1
told	1
Kutuzov	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
because	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
capital,	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
army	1
remained.	1
	1
"Things	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
different	1
if	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
had	1
not	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
abandon	1
Moscow	1
without	1
another	1
battle;	1
all	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
happened,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
at	1
Rostopchin	1
as	1
if,	1
not	1
grasping	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
read	1
something	1
peculiar	1
written	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
addressing	1
him.	1
Rostopchin	1
grew	1
confused	1
and	1
became	1
silent.	1
Kutuzov	1
slightly	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
penetrating	1
gaze	1
from	1
Rostopchin's	1
face	1
muttered	1
softly:	1
	1
"No!	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle!"	1
	1
Whether	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
something	1
entirely	1
different	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
those	1
words,	1
or	1
uttered	1
them	1
purposely,	1
knowing	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
meaningless,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
Rostopchin	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
hastily	1
left	1
him.	1
And	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
Governor	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
proud	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
Cossack	1
whip	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
where	1
he	1
began	1
with	1
shouts	1
to	1
drive	1
on	1
the	1
carts	1
that	1
blocked	1
the	1
way.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVI	1
	1
Toward	1
four	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
Murat's	1
troops	1
were	1
entering	1
Moscow.	1
In	1
front	1
rode	1
a	1
detachment	1
of	1
Wurttemberg	1
hussars	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
rode	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Naples	1
himself	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
numerous	1
suite.	1
	1
About	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
Arbat	1
Street,	1
near	1
the	1
Church	1
of	1
the	1
Miraculous	1
Icon	1
of	1
St.	1
Nicholas,	1
Murat	1
halted	1
to	1
await	1
news	1
from	1
the	1
advanced	1
detachment	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
citadel,	1
le	1
Kremlin.	1
	1
Around	1
Murat	1
gathered	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
They	1
all	1
stared	1
in	1
timid	1
bewilderment	1
at	1
the	1
strange,	1
long-haired	1
commander	1
dressed	1
up	1
in	1
feathers	1
and	1
gold.	1
	1
"Is	1
that	1
their	1
Tsar	1
himself?	1
He's	1
not	1
bad!"	1
low	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
saying.	1
	1
An	1
interpreter	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
group.	1
	1
"Take	1
off	1
your	1
cap...	1
your	1
caps!"	1
These	1
words	1
went	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
crowd.	1
The	1
interpreter	1
addressed	1
an	1
old	1
porter	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
to	1
the	1
Kremlin.	1
The	1
porter,	1
listening	1
in	1
perplexity	1
to	1
the	1
unfamiliar	1
Polish	1
accent	1
and	1
not	1
realizing	1
that	1
the	1
interpreter	1
was	1
speaking	1
Russian,	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
slipped	1
behind	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
Murat	1
approached	1
the	1
interpreter	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
where	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
asked	1
and	1
several	1
voices	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
answering	1
the	1
interpreter.	1
A	1
French	1
officer,	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
advanced	1
detachment,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Murat	1
and	1
reported	1
that	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
citadel	1
had	1
been	1
barricaded	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
probably	1
an	1
ambuscade	1
there.	1
	1
"Good!"	1
said	1
Murat	1
and,	1
turning	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
his	1
suite,	1
ordered	1
four	1
light	1
guns	1
to	1
be	1
moved	1
forward	1
to	1
fire	1
at	1
the	1
gates.	1
	1
The	1
guns	1
emerged	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
from	1
the	1
column	1
following	1
Murat	1
and	1
advanced	1
up	1
the	1
Arbat.	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka	1
Street	1
they	1
halted	1
and	1
drew	1
in	1
the	1
Square.	1
Several	1
French	1
officers	1
superintended	1
the	1
placing	1
of	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
through	1
field	1
glasses.	1
	1
The	1
bells	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
were	1
ringing	1
for	1
vespers,	1
and	1
this	1
sound	1
troubled	1
the	1
French.	1
They	1
imagined	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
call	1
to	1
arms.	1
A	1
few	1
infantrymen	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
Kutafyev	1
Gate.	1
Beams	1
and	1
wooden	1
screens	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
there,	1
and	1
two	1
musket	1
shots	1
rang	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
gate	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
toward	1
it.	1
A	1
general	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
guns	1
shouted	1
some	1
words	1
of	1
command	1
to	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
ran	1
back	1
again	1
with	1
his	1
men.	1
	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
three	1
more	1
shots	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
One	1
shot	1
struck	1
a	1
French	1
soldier's	1
foot,	1
and	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
screens	1
came	1
the	1
strange	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
voices	1
shouting.	1
Instantly	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
cheerful	1
serenity	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
general,	1
officers,	1
and	1
men	1
changed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
determined	1
concentrated	1
readiness	1
for	1
strife	1
and	1
suffering.	1
To	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
marshal	1
to	1
the	1
least	1
soldier,	1
that	1
place	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka,	1
Mokhavaya,	1
or	1
Kutafyev	1
Street,	1
nor	1
the	1
Troitsa	1
Gate	1
(places	1
familiar	1
in	1
Moscow),	1
but	1
a	1
new	1
battlefield	1
which	1
would	1
probably	1
prove	1
sanguinary.	1
And	1
all	1
made	1
ready	1
for	1
that	1
battle.	1
The	1
cries	1
from	1
the	1
gates	1
ceased.	1
The	1
guns	1
were	1
advanced,	1
the	1
artillerymen	1
blew	1
the	1
ash	1
off	1
their	1
linstocks,	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
gave	1
the	1
word	1
"Fire!"	1
This	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
two	1
whistling	1
sounds	1
of	1
canister	1
shot,	1
one	1
after	1
another.	1
The	1
shot	1
rattled	1
against	1
the	1
stone	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
wooden	1
beams	1
and	1
screens,	1
and	1
two	1
wavering	1
clouds	1
of	1
smoke	1
rose	1
over	1
the	1
Square.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
instants	1
after	1
the	1
echo	1
of	1
the	1
reports	1
resounding	1
over	1
the	1
stone-	1
built	1
Kremlin	1
had	1
died	1
away	1
the	1
French	1
heard	1
a	1
strange	1
sound	1
above	1
their	1
head.	1
Thousands	1
of	1
crows	1
rose	1
above	1
the	1
walls	1
and	1
circled	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
cawing	1
and	1
noisily	1
flapping	1
their	1
wings.	1
Together	1
with	1
that	1
sound	1
came	1
a	1
solitary	1
human	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
gateway	1
and	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
appeared	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
bareheaded	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
peasant's	1
coat.	1
He	1
grasped	1
a	1
musket	1
and	1
took	1
aim	1
at	1
the	1
French.	1
"Fire!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
officer	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
a	1
musket	1
and	1
of	1
two	1
cannon	1
shots	1
were	1
heard	1
simultaneously.	1
The	1
gate	1
was	1
again	1
hidden	1
by	1
smoke.	1
	1
Nothing	1
more	1
stirred	1
behind	1
the	1
screens	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
infantry	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
advanced	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
In	1
the	1
gateway	1
lay	1
three	1
wounded	1
and	1
four	1
dead.	1
Two	1
men	1
in	1
peasant	1
coats	1
ran	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
toward	1
the	1
Znamenka.	1
	1
"Clear	1
that	1
away!"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
beams	1
and	1
the	1
corpses,	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers,	1
after	1
dispatching	1
the	1
wounded,	1
threw	1
the	1
corpses	1
over	1
the	1
parapet.	1
	1
Who	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
nobody	1
knew.	1
"Clear	1
that	1
away!"	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
thrown	1
over	1
the	1
parapet	1
and	1
removed	1
later	1
on	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
stink.	1
Thiers	1
alone	1
dedicates	1
a	1
few	1
eloquent	1
lines	1
to	1
their	1
memory:	1
"These	1
wretches	1
had	1
occupied	1
the	1
sacred	1
citadel,	1
having	1
supplied	1
themselves	1
with	1
guns	1
from	1
the	1
arsenal,	1
and	1
fired"	1
(the	1
wretches)	1
"at	1
the	1
French.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
sabered	1
and	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
was	1
purged	1
of	1
their	1
presence."	1
	1
Murat	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
had	1
been	1
cleared.	1
The	1
French	1
entered	1
the	1
gates	1
and	1
began	1
pitching	1
their	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
Senate	1
Square.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
House	1
the	1
soldiers	1
threw	1
chairs	1
into	1
the	1
Square	1
for	1
fuel	1
and	1
kindled	1
fires	1
there.	1
	1
Other	1
detachments	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
and	1
encamped	1
along	1
the	1
Moroseyka,	1
the	1
Lubyanka,	1
and	1
Pokrovka	1
Streets.	1
Others	1
quartered	1
themselves	1
along	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka,	1
the	1
Nikolski,	1
and	1
the	1
Tverskoy	1
Streets.	1
No	1
masters	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
being	1
found	1
anywhere,	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
not	1
billeted	1
on	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
towns	1
but	1
lived	1
in	1
it	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
camp.	1
	1
Though	1
tattered,	1
hungry,	1
worn	1
out,	1
and	1
reduced	1
to	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
their	1
original	1
number,	1
the	1
French	1
entered	1
Moscow	1
in	1
good	1
marching	1
order.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
weary	1
and	1
famished,	1
but	1
still	1
a	1
fighting	1
and	1
menacing	1
army.	1
But	1
it	1
remained	1
an	1
army	1
only	1
until	1
its	1
soldiers	1
had	1
dispersed	1
into	1
their	1
different	1
lodgings.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
regiments	1
began	1
to	1
disperse	1
among	1
the	1
wealthy	1
and	1
deserted	1
houses,	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
lost	1
forever	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
being	1
something	1
nondescript,	1
neither	1
citizens	1
nor	1
soldiers	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
known	1
as	1
marauders.	1
When	1
five	1
weeks	1
later	1
these	1
same	1
men	1
left	1
Moscow,	1
they	1
no	1
longer	1
formed	1
an	1
army.	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
mob	1
of	1
marauders,	1
each	1
carrying	1
a	1
quantity	1
of	1
articles	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
valuable	1
or	1
useful.	1
The	1
aim	1
of	1
each	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
Moscow	1
was	1
no	1
longer,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been,	1
to	1
conquer,	1
but	1
merely	1
to	1
keep	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
acquired.	1
Like	1
a	1
monkey	1
which	1
puts	1
its	1
paw	1
into	1
the	1
narrow	1
neck	1
of	1
a	1
jug,	1
and	1
having	1
seized	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
nuts	1
will	1
not	1
open	1
its	1
fist	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
losing	1
what	1
it	1
holds,	1
and	1
therefore	1
perishes,	1
the	1
French	1
when	1
they	1
left	1
Moscow	1
had	1
inevitably	1
to	1
perish	1
because	1
they	1
carried	1
their	1
loot	1
with	1
them,	1
yet	1
to	1
abandon	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
stolen	1
was	1
as	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
monkey	1
to	1
open	1
its	1
paw	1
and	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
its	1
nuts.	1
Ten	1
minutes	1
after	1
each	1
regiment	1
had	1
entered	1
a	1
Moscow	1
district,	1
not	1
a	1
soldier	1
or	1
officer	1
was	1
left.	1
Men	1
in	1
military	1
uniforms	1
and	1
Hessian	1
boots	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
the	1
windows,	1
laughing	1
and	1
walking	1
through	1
the	1
rooms.	1
In	1
cellars	1
and	1
storerooms	1
similar	1
men	1
were	1
busy	1
among	1
the	1
provisions,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
yards	1
unlocking	1
or	1
breaking	1
open	1
coach	1
house	1
and	1
stable	1
doors,	1
lighting	1
fires	1
in	1
kitchens	1
and	1
kneading	1
and	1
baking	1
bread	1
with	1
rolled-up	1
sleeves,	1
and	1
cooking;	1
or	1
frightening,	1
amusing,	1
or	1
caressing	1
women	1
and	1
children.	1
There	1
were	1
many	1
such	1
men	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
shops	1
and	1
houses--but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
army.	1
	1
Order	1
after	1
order	1
was	1
issued	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
commanders	1
that	1
day	1
forbidding	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
disperse	1
about	1
the	1
town,	1
sternly	1
forbidding	1
any	1
violence	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
or	1
any	1
looting,	1
and	1
announcing	1
a	1
roll	1
call	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
evening.	1
But	1
despite	1
all	1
these	1
measures	1
the	1
men,	1
who	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
constituted	1
an	1
army,	1
flowed	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
wealthy,	1
deserted	1
city	1
with	1
its	1
comforts	1
and	1
plentiful	1
supplies.	1
As	1
a	1
hungry	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
keeps	1
well	1
together	1
when	1
crossing	1
a	1
barren	1
field,	1
but	1
gets	1
out	1
of	1
hand	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
disperses	1
uncontrollably	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
reaches	1
rich	1
pastures,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
army	1
disperse	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
wealthy	1
city.	1
	1
No	1
residents	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers--like	1
water	1
percolating	1
through	1
sand--spread	1
irresistibly	1
through	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
from	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
first	1
marched.	1
The	1
cavalry,	1
on	1
entering	1
a	1
merchant's	1
house	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
and	1
finding	1
there	1
stabling	1
more	1
than	1
sufficient	1
for	1
their	1
horses,	1
went	1
on,	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
house	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
better.	1
Many	1
of	1
them	1
appropriated	1
several	1
houses,	1
chalked	1
their	1
names	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
quarreled	1
and	1
even	1
fought	1
with	1
other	1
companies	1
for	1
them.	1
Before	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
secure	1
quarters	1
the	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
city	1
and,	1
hearing	1
that	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned,	1
rushed	1
to	1
places	1
where	1
valuables	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
taking.	1
The	1
officers	1
followed	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
were	1
involuntarily	1
drawn	1
into	1
doing	1
the	1
same.	1
In	1
Carriage	1
Row	1
carriages	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
shops,	1
and	1
generals	1
flocked	1
there	1
to	1
select	1
caleches	1
and	1
coaches	1
for	1
themselves.	1
The	1
few	1
inhabitants	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
invited	1
commanding	1
officers	1
to	1
their	1
houses,	1
hoping	1
thereby	1
to	1
secure	1
themselves	1
from	1
being	1
plundered.	1
There	1
were	1
masses	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
no	1
end	1
to	1
it.	1
All	1
around	1
the	1
quarters	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
other	1
regions	1
still	1
unexplored	1
and	1
unoccupied	1
where,	1
they	1
thought,	1
yet	1
greater	1
riches	1
might	1
be	1
found.	1
And	1
Moscow	1
engulfed	1
the	1
army	1
ever	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper.	1
When	1
water	1
is	1
spilled	1
on	1
dry	1
ground	1
both	1
the	1
dry	1
ground	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
disappear	1
and	1
mud	1
results;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
famished	1
army	1
into	1
the	1
rich	1
and	1
deserted	1
city	1
resulted	1
in	1
fires	1
and	1
looting	1
and	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
both	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
wealthy	1
city.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
attributed	1
the	1
Fire	1
of	1
Moscow	1
au	1
patriotisme	1
feroce	1
de	1
Rostopchine,	1
*	1
the	1
Russians	1
to	1
the	1
barbarity	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
In	1
reality,	1
however,	1
it	1
was	1
not,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be,	1
possible	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
by	1
making	1
any	1
individual,	1
or	1
any	1
group	1
of	1
people,	1
responsible	1
for	1
it.	1
Moscow	1
was	1
burned	1
because	1
it	1
found	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
any	1
town	1
built	1
of	1
wood	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
burn,	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
whether	1
it	1
had,	1
or	1
had	1
not,	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
inferior	1
fire	1
engines.	1
Deserted	1
Moscow	1
had	1
to	1
burn	1
as	1
inevitably	1
as	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
shavings	1
has	1
to	1
burn	1
on	1
which	1
sparks	1
continually	1
fall	1
for	1
several	1
days.	1
A	1
town	1
built	1
of	1
wood,	1
where	1
scarcely	1
a	1
day	1
passes	1
without	1
conflagrations	1
when	1
the	1
house	1
owners	1
are	1
in	1
residence	1
and	1
a	1
police	1
force	1
is	1
present,	1
cannot	1
help	1
burning	1
when	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
have	1
left	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
occupied	1
by	1
soldiers	1
who	1
smoke	1
pipes,	1
make	1
campfires	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
chairs	1
in	1
the	1
Senate	1
Square,	1
and	1
cook	1
themselves	1
meals	1
twice	1
a	1
day.	1
In	1
peacetime	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
to	1
billet	1
troops	1
in	1
the	1
villages	1
of	1
any	1
district	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
fires	1
in	1
that	1
district	1
immediately	1
increases.	1
How	1
much	1
then	1
must	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
fire	1
be	1
increased	1
in	1
an	1
abandoned,	1
wooden	1
town	1
where	1
foreign	1
troops	1
are	1
quartered.	1
"Le	1
patriotisme	1
feroce	1
de	1
Rostopchine"	1
and	1
the	1
barbarity	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
Moscow	1
was	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
pipes,	1
kitchens,	1
and	1
campfires,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
carelessness	1
of	1
enemy	1
soldiers	1
occupying	1
houses	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
own.	1
Even	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
arson	1
(which	1
is	1
very	1
doubtful,	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
houses--in	1
any	1
case	1
a	1
troublesome	1
and	1
dangerous	1
thing	1
to	1
do),	1
arson	1
cannot	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
cause,	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
without	1
any	1
incendiarism.	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
Rostopchin's	1
ferocious	1
patriotism.	1
	1
However	1
tempting	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
blame	1
Rostopchin's	1
ferocity	1
and	1
for	1
Russians	1
to	1
blame	1
the	1
scoundrel	1
Bonaparte,	1
or	1
later	1
on	1
to	1
place	1
an	1
heroic	1
torch	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
people,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
such	1
direct	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
for	1
Moscow	1
had	1
to	1
burn	1
as	1
every	1
village,	1
factory,	1
or	1
house	1
must	1
burn	1
which	1
is	1
left	1
by	1
its	1
owners	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
strangers	1
are	1
allowed	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
cook	1
their	1
porridge.	1
Moscow	1
was	1
burned	1
by	1
its	1
inhabitants,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
but	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
abandoned	1
it	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
remained	1
in	1
it.	1
Moscow	1
when	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
enemy	1
did	1
not	1
remain	1
intact	1
like	1
Berlin,	1
Vienna,	1
and	1
other	1
towns,	1
simply	1
because	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
abandoned	1
it	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
welcome	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
salt,	1
nor	1
bring	1
them	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVII	1
	1
The	1
absorption	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
by	1
Moscow,	1
radiating	1
starwise	1
as	1
it	1
did,	1
only	1
reached	1
the	1
quarter	1
where	1
Pierre	1
was	1
staying	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
days	1
spent	1
in	1
solitude	1
and	1
unusual	1
circumstances,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
bordering	1
on	1
insanity.	1
He	1
was	1
completely	1
obsessed	1
by	1
one	1
persistent	1
thought.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
or	1
when	1
this	1
thought	1
had	1
taken	1
such	1
possession	1
of	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
remembered	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
understood	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
present,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
home	1
only	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
intricate	1
tangle	1
of	1
life's	1
demands	1
that	1
enmeshed	1
him,	1
and	1
which	1
in	1
his	1
present	1
condition	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
unravel.	1
He	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
house,	1
on	1
the	1
plea	1
of	1
sorting	1
the	1
deceased's	1
books	1
and	1
papers,	1
only	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
rest	1
from	1
life's	1
turmoil,	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
eternal,	1
solemn,	1
and	1
calm	1
thoughts,	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
restless	1
confusion	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
being	1
drawn.	1
He	1
sought	1
a	1
quiet	1
refuge,	1
and	1
in	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
study	1
he	1
really	1
found	1
it.	1
When	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
dusty	1
writing	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
deathlike	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
study,	1
calm	1
and	1
significant	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
rose	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
in	1
his	1
imagination,	1
particularly	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
vague	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
insignificance	1
and	1
insincerity	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
truth,	1
simplicity,	1
and	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
mentally	1
classed	1
as	1
they.	1
When	1
Gerasim	1
roused	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
reverie	1
the	1
idea	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
popular	1
defense	1
of	1
Moscow	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
projected.	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
object	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
Gerasim	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
a	1
peasant's	1
coat	1
and	1
a	1
pistol,	1
confiding	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
intentions	1
of	1
remaining	1
in	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
house	1
and	1
keeping	1
his	1
name	1
secret.	1
Then	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
spent	1
in	1
inaction	1
and	1
solitude	1
(he	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
fix	1
his	1
attention	1
on	1
the	1
masonic	1
manuscripts,	1
but	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
do	1
so)	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
had	1
previously	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
cabalistic	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
Bonaparte's	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
vaguely	1
presented	1
itself.	1
But	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he,	1
L'russe	1
Besuhof,	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
limit	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Beast	1
was	1
as	1
yet	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fancies	1
that	1
often	1
passed	1
through	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
left	1
no	1
trace	1
behind.	1
	1
When,	1
having	1
bought	1
the	1
coat	1
merely	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
taking	1
part	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
met	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
Natasha	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
"Are	1
you	1
remaining	1
in	1
Moscow?...	1
How	1
splendid!"	1
the	1
thought	1
flashed	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
it	1
really	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
even	1
if	1
Moscow	1
were	1
taken,	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
remain	1
there	1
and	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
predestined	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
idea	1
of	1
not	1
sparing	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
lagging	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
behind	1
them,	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
gate.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
convinced	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
defended,	1
he	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
before	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
merely	1
a	1
possibility	1
had	1
now	1
become	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
and	1
inevitable.	1
He	1
must	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
concealing	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
must	1
meet	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
either	1
perish	1
or	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
all	1
Europe--which	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
solely	1
due	1
to	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
attempt	1
on	1
Bonaparte's	1
life	1
in	1
1809	1
by	1
a	1
German	1
student	1
in	1
Vienna,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
student	1
had	1
been	1
shot.	1
And	1
the	1
risk	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
expose	1
his	1
life	1
by	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
design	1
excited	1
him	1
still	1
more.	1
	1
Two	1
equally	1
strong	1
feelings	1
drew	1
Pierre	1
irresistibly	1
to	1
this	1
purpose.	1
The	1
first	1
was	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
suffering	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
calamity,	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
that	1
had	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Mozhaysk	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fifth	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
thick	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
had	1
now	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
home	1
and,	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
luxury	1
and	1
comfort	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
accustomed,	1
to	1
sleep	1
on	1
a	1
hard	1
sofa	1
without	1
undressing	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
same	1
food	1
as	1
Gerasim.	1
The	1
other	1
was	1
that	1
vague	1
and	1
quite	1
Russian	1
feeling	1
of	1
contempt	1
for	1
everything	1
conventional,	1
artificial,	1
and	1
human--for	1
everything	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
men	1
regard	1
as	1
the	1
greatest	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
first	1
experienced	1
this	1
strange	1
and	1
fascinating	1
feeling	1
at	1
the	1
Sloboda	1
Palace,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
wealth,	1
power,	1
and	1
life--all	1
that	1
men	1
so	1
painstakingly	1
acquire	1
and	1
guard--if	1
it	1
has	1
any	1
worth	1
has	1
so	1
only	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
joy	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
can	1
all	1
be	1
renounced.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
induces	1
a	1
volunteer	1
recruit	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
last	1
penny	1
on	1
drink,	1
and	1
a	1
drunken	1
man	1
to	1
smash	1
mirrors	1
or	1
glasses	1
for	1
no	1
apparent	1
reason	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
cost	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
possesses:	1
the	1
feeling	1
which	1
causes	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
perform	1
actions	1
which	1
from	1
an	1
ordinary	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
are	1
insane,	1
to	1
test,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
his	1
personal	1
power	1
and	1
strength,	1
affirming	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
a	1
higher,	1
nonhuman	1
criterion	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
Pierre	1
had	1
experienced	1
this	1
feeling	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
Sloboda	1
Palace	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
continuously	1
under	1
its	1
influence,	1
but	1
only	1
now	1
found	1
full	1
satisfaction	1
for	1
it.	1
Moreover,	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
was	1
supported	1
in	1
his	1
design	1
and	1
prevented	1
from	1
renouncing	1
it	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
done	1
in	1
that	1
direction.	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
now	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
like	1
everyone	1
else,	1
his	1
flight	1
from	1
home,	1
the	1
peasant	1
coat,	1
the	1
pistol,	1
and	1
his	1
announcement	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow	1
would	1
all	1
become	1
not	1
merely	1
meaningless	1
but	1
contemptible	1
and	1
ridiculous,	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
Pierre	1
was	1
very	1
sensitive.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
physical	1
condition,	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case,	1
corresponded	1
to	1
his	1
mental	1
state.	1
The	1
unaccustomed	1
coarse	1
food,	1
the	1
vodka	1
he	1
drank	1
during	1
those	1
days,	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
cigars,	1
his	1
dirty	1
unchanged	1
linen,	1
two	1
almost	1
sleepless	1
nights	1
passed	1
on	1
a	1
short	1
sofa	1
without	1
bedding--all	1
this	1
kept	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
bordering	1
on	1
insanity.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
two	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
already	1
entered	1
Moscow.	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
this,	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
acting	1
he	1
only	1
thought	1
about	1
his	1
undertaking,	1
going	1
over	1
its	1
minutest	1
details	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
In	1
his	1
fancy	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
clearly	1
picture	1
to	1
himself	1
either	1
the	1
striking	1
of	1
the	1
blow	1
or	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
but	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
vividness	1
and	1
melancholy	1
enjoyment	1
imagined	1
his	1
own	1
destruction	1
and	1
heroic	1
endurance.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
alone,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
all,	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
it	1
or	1
perish!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
will	1
approach...	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly...	1
with	1
pistol	1
or	1
dagger?	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same!	1
'It	1
is	1
not	1
I	1
but	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Providence	1
that	1
punishes	1
thee,'	1
I	1
shall	1
say,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
imagining	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
when	1
killing	1
Napoleon.	1
"Well	1
then,	1
take	1
me	1
and	1
execute	1
me!"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
speaking	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
bowing	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
but	1
firm	1
expression.	1
	1
While	1
Pierre,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
the	1
study	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
appeared	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
always	1
so	1
timid	1
before	1
but	1
now	1
quite	1
transformed.	1
	1
His	1
dressing	1
gown	1
was	1
unfastened,	1
his	1
face	1
red	1
and	1
distorted.	1
He	1
was	1
obviously	1
drunk.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Pierre	1
he	1
grew	1
confused	1
at	1
first,	1
but	1
noticing	1
embarrassment	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
immediately	1
grew	1
bold	1
and,	1
staggering	1
on	1
his	1
thin	1
legs,	1
advanced	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"They're	1
frightened,"	1
he	1
said	1
confidentially	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice.	1
"I	1
say	1
I	1
won't	1
surrender,	1
I	1
say...	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
right,	1
sir?"	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
seeing	1
the	1
pistol	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
seized	1
it	1
with	1
unexpected	1
rapidity	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor.	1
	1
Gerasim	1
and	1
the	1
porter,	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
stopped	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
pistol	1
from	1
him.	1
Pierre,	1
coming	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor,	1
looked	1
with	1
pity	1
and	1
repulsion	1
at	1
the	1
half-crazy	1
old	1
man.	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
frowning	1
with	1
exertion,	1
held	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
pistol	1
and	1
screamed	1
hoarsely,	1
evidently	1
with	1
some	1
heroic	1
fancy	1
in	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"To	1
arms!	1
Board	1
them!	1
No,	1
you	1
shan't	1
get	1
it,"	1
he	1
yelled.	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
do,	1
please,	1
that	1
will	1
do.	1
Have	1
the	1
goodness--please,	1
sir,	1
to	1
let	1
go!	1
Please,	1
sir..."	1
pleaded	1
Gerasim,	1
trying	1
carefully	1
to	1
steer	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
by	1
the	1
elbows	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?	1
Bonaparte!..."	1
shouted	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
right,	1
sir.	1
Come	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
please,	1
and	1
rest.	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
pistol."	1
	1
"Be	1
off,	1
thou	1
base	1
slave!	1
Touch	1
me	1
not!	1
See	1
this?"	1
shouted	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
brandishing	1
the	1
pistol.	1
"Board	1
them!"	1
	1
"Catch	1
hold!"	1
whispered	1
Gerasim	1
to	1
the	1
porter.	1
	1
They	1
seized	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
by	1
the	1
arms	1
and	1
dragged	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
The	1
vestibule	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
discordant	1
sounds	1
of	1
a	1
struggle	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
tipsy,	1
hoarse	1
voice.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
fresh	1
sound,	1
a	1
piercing	1
feminine	1
scream,	1
reverberated	1
from	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
the	1
cook	1
came	1
running	1
into	1
the	1
vestibule.	1
	1
"It's	1
them!	1
Gracious	1
heavens!	1
O	1
Lord,	1
four	1
of	1
them,	1
horsemen!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
	1
Gerasim	1
and	1
the	1
porter	1
let	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
go,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
now	1
silent	1
corridor	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
several	1
hands	1
knocking	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXVIII	1
	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
decided	1
that	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
out	1
his	1
design	1
he	1
would	1
disclose	1
neither	1
his	1
identity	1
nor	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
French,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
half-open	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
corridor,	1
intending	1
to	1
conceal	1
himself	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
entered.	1
But	1
the	1
French	1
entered	1
and	1
still	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
retire--an	1
irresistible	1
curiosity	1
kept	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
of	1
them.	1
One	1
was	1
an	1
officer--a	1
tall,	1
soldierly,	1
handsome	1
man--the	1
other	1
evidently	1
a	1
private	1
or	1
an	1
orderly,	1
sunburned,	1
short,	1
and	1
thin,	1
with	1
sunken	1
cheeks	1
and	1
a	1
dull	1
expression.	1
The	1
officer	1
walked	1
in	1
front,	1
leaning	1
on	1
a	1
stick	1
and	1
slightly	1
limping.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
advanced	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
he	1
stopped,	1
having	1
apparently	1
decided	1
that	1
these	1
were	1
good	1
quarters,	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
of	1
command	1
ordered	1
them	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
the	1
horses.	1
Having	1
done	1
that,	1
the	1
officer,	1
lifting	1
his	1
elbow	1
with	1
a	1
smart	1
gesture,	1
stroked	1
his	1
mustache	1
and	1
lightly	1
touched	1
his	1
hat.	1
	1
"Bonjour,	1
la	1
compagnie!"	1
*	1
said	1
he	1
gaily,	1
smiling	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Good	1
day,	1
everybody!"	1
	1
No	1
one	1
gave	1
any	1
reply.	1
	1
"Vous	1
etes	1
le	1
bourgeois?"	1
*	1
the	1
officer	1
asked	1
Gerasim.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Are	1
you	1
the	1
master	1
here?"	1
	1
Gerasim	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
with	1
an	1
alarmed	1
and	1
inquiring	1
look.	1
	1
"Quartier,	1
quartier,	1
logement!"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
condescending	1
and	1
good-natured	1
smile.	1
"Les	1
francais	1
sont	1
de	1
bons	1
enfants.	1
Que	1
diable!	1
Voyons!	1
Ne	1
nous	1
fachons	1
pas,	1
mon	1
vieux!"	1
*	1
added	1
he,	1
clapping	1
the	1
scared	1
and	1
silent	1
Gerasim	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
"Well,	1
does	1
no	1
one	1
speak	1
French	1
in	1
this	1
establishment?"	1
he	1
asked	1
again	1
in	1
French,	1
looking	1
around	1
and	1
meeting	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
Pierre	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Quarters,	1
quarters,	1
lodgings!	1
The	1
French	1
are	1
good	1
fellows.	1
What	1
the	1
devil!	1
There,	1
don't	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
cross,	1
old	1
fellow!"	1
	1
Again	1
the	1
officer	1
turned	1
to	1
Gerasim	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"Master,	1
not	1
here--don't	1
understand...	1
me,	1
you..."	1
said	1
Gerasim,	1
trying	1
to	1
render	1
his	1
words	1
more	1
comprehensible	1
by	1
contorting	1
them.	1
	1
Still	1
smiling,	1
the	1
French	1
officer	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
Gerasim's	1
nose,	1
intimating	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
either,	1
and	1
moved,	1
limping,	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
standing.	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
conceal	1
himself,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
appearing	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
kitchen	1
door	1
with	1
the	1
pistol	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
With	1
a	1
madman's	1
cunning,	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
eyed	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
raised	1
his	1
pistol,	1
and	1
took	1
aim.	1
	1
"Board	1
them!"	1
yelled	1
the	1
tipsy	1
man,	1
trying	1
to	1
press	1
the	1
trigger.	1
Hearing	1
the	1
yell	1
the	1
officer	1
turned	1
round,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
drunkard.	1
Just	1
when	1
Pierre	1
snatched	1
at	1
and	1
struck	1
up	1
the	1
pistol	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
at	1
last	1
got	1
his	1
fingers	1
on	1
the	1
trigger,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deafening	1
report,	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
enveloped	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
turned	1
pale	1
and	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Forgetting	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
concealing	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
French,	1
Pierre,	1
snatching	1
away	1
the	1
pistol	1
and	1
throwing	1
it	1
down,	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
addressed	1
him	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
wounded?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
not,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
feeling	1
himself	1
over.	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
lucky	1
escape	1
this	1
time,"	1
he	1
added,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
damaged	1
plaster	1
of	1
the	1
wall.	1
"Who	1
is	1
that	1
man?"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
sternly	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
am	1
really	1
in	1
despair	1
at	1
what	1
has	1
occurred,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
rapidly,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
intended	1
to	1
play.	1
"He	1
is	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
madman	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing."	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
collar.	1
	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
parted	1
lips,	1
swaying,	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep,	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
"Brigand!	1
You	1
shall	1
pay	1
for	1
this,"	1
said	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
letting	1
go	1
of	1
him.	1
"We	1
French	1
are	1
merciful	1
after	1
victory,	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
pardon	1
traitors,"	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
gloomy	1
dignity	1
and	1
a	1
fine	1
energetic	1
gesture.	1
	1
Pierre	1
continued,	1
in	1
French,	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
officer	1
not	1
to	1
hold	1
that	1
drunken	1
imbecile	1
to	1
account.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
gloomy	1
expression,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
His	1
handsome	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
melodramatically	1
gentle	1
expression	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
saved	1
my	1
life.	1
You	1
are	1
French,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
that	1
deduction	1
was	1
indubitable.	1
Only	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
could	1
perform	1
a	1
great	1
deed,	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
life--the	1
life	1
of	1
M.	1
Ramballe,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
13th	1
Light	1
Regiment--was	1
undoubtedly	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
deed.	1
	1
But	1
however	1
indubitable	1
that	1
conclusion	1
and	1
the	1
officer's	1
conviction	1
based	1
upon	1
it,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
disillusion	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
Russian,"	1
he	1
said	1
quickly.	1
	1
"Tut,	1
tut,	1
tut!	1
Tell	1
that	1
to	1
others,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
waving	1
his	1
finger	1
before	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
smiling.	1
"You	1
shall	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
that	1
presently.	1
I	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
compatriot.	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
man?"	1
he	1
added,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
Pierre	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
Even	1
if	1
Pierre	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
having	1
once	1
received	1
that	1
loftiest	1
of	1
human	1
appellations	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
renounce	1
it,	1
said	1
the	1
officer's	1
look	1
and	1
tone.	1
In	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
last	1
question	1
Pierre	1
again	1
explained	1
who	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
and	1
how	1
just	1
before	1
their	1
arrival	1
that	1
drunken	1
imbecile	1
had	1
seized	1
the	1
loaded	1
pistol	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
recover	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
officer	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
deed	1
go	1
unpunished.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
expanded	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
majestic	1
gesture	1
with	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
saved	1
my	1
life!	1
You	1
are	1
French.	1
You	1
ask	1
his	1
pardon?	1
I	1
grant	1
it	1
you.	1
Lead	1
that	1
man	1
away!"	1
said	1
he	1
quickly	1
and	1
energetically,	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
Pierre	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
promoted	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
for	1
saving	1
his	1
life,	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
hearing	1
the	1
shot,	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
asking	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
and	1
expressed	1
their	1
readiness	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
culprits,	1
but	1
the	1
officer	1
sternly	1
checked	1
them.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
wanted,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
went	1
out	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
orderly,	1
who	1
had	1
meanwhile	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
kitchen,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
officer.	1
	1
"Captain,	1
there	1
is	1
soup	1
and	1
a	1
leg	1
of	1
mutton	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Shall	1
I	1
serve	1
them	1
up?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
some	1
wine,"	1
answered	1
the	1
captain.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIX	1
	1
When	1
the	1
French	1
officer	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
Pierre	1
the	1
latter	1
again	1
thought	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
French	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
but	1
the	1
officer	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
very	1
polite,	1
amiable,	1
good-natured,	1
and	1
genuinely	1
grateful	1
to	1
Pierre	1
for	1
saving	1
his	1
life	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
refuse,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
parlor--the	1
first	1
room	1
they	1
entered.	1
To	1
Pierre's	1
assurances	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
the	1
captain,	1
evidently	1
not	1
understanding	1
how	1
anyone	1
could	1
decline	1
so	1
flattering	1
an	1
appellation,	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
Pierre	1
absolutely	1
insisted	1
on	1
passing	1
for	1
a	1
Russian	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
forever	1
bound	1
to	1
Pierre	1
by	1
gratitude	1
for	1
saving	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
Had	1
this	1
man	1
been	1
endowed	1
with	1
the	1
slightest	1
capacity	1
for	1
perceiving	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
had	1
he	1
at	1
all	1
understood	1
what	1
Pierre's	1
feelings	1
were,	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
left	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
man's	1
animated	1
obtuseness	1
to	1
everything	1
other	1
than	1
himself	1
disarmed	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"A	1
Frenchman	1
or	1
a	1
Russian	1
prince	1
incognito,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
fine	1
though	1
dirty	1
linen	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
finger.	1
"I	1
owe	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
friendship.	1
A	1
Frenchman	1
never	1
forgets	1
either	1
an	1
insult	1
or	1
a	1
service.	1
I	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
friendship.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
nature	1
and	1
nobility	1
(in	1
the	1
French	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word)	1
in	1
the	1
officer's	1
voice,	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
gestures,	1
that	1
Pierre,	1
unconsciously	1
smiling	1
in	1
response	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman's	1
smile,	1
pressed	1
the	1
hand	1
held	1
out	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Captain	1
Ramballe,	1
of	1
the	1
13th	1
Light	1
Regiment,	1
Chevalier	1
of	1
the	1
Legion	1
of	1
Honor	1
for	1
the	1
affair	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
of	1
September,"	1
he	1
introduced	1
himself,	1
a	1
self-satisfied	1
irrepressible	1
smile	1
puckering	1
his	1
lips	1
under	1
his	1
mustache.	1
"Will	1
you	1
now	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
conversing	1
so	1
pleasantly,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
ambulance	1
with	1
that	1
maniac's	1
bullet	1
in	1
my	1
body?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
his	1
name	1
and,	1
blushing,	1
began	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
invent	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
about	1
his	1
reason	1
for	1
concealing	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
hastily	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
please!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
understand	1
your	1
reasons.	1
You	1
are	1
an	1
officer...	1
a	1
superior	1
officer	1
perhaps.	1
You	1
have	1
borne	1
arms	1
against	1
us.	1
That's	1
not	1
my	1
business.	1
I	1
owe	1
you	1
my	1
life.	1
That	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
at	1
your	1
service.	1
You	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
gentry?"	1
he	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
inquiry	1
in	1
his	1
tone.	1
Pierre	1
bent	1
his	1
head.	1
"Your	1
baptismal	1
name,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
ask.	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
you	1
say....	1
That's	1
all	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know."	1
	1
When	1
the	1
mutton	1
and	1
an	1
omelet	1
had	1
been	1
served	1
and	1
a	1
samovar	1
and	1
vodka	1
brought,	1
with	1
some	1
wine	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
a	1
Russian	1
cellar	1
and	1
brought	1
with	1
them,	1
Ramballe	1
invited	1
Pierre	1
to	1
share	1
his	1
dinner,	1
and	1
himself	1
began	1
to	1
eat	1
greedily	1
and	1
quickly	1
like	1
a	1
healthy	1
and	1
hungry	1
man,	1
munching	1
his	1
food	1
rapidly	1
with	1
his	1
strong	1
teeth,	1
continually	1
smacking	1
his	1
lips,	1
and	1
repeating--"Excellent!	1
Delicious!"	1
His	1
face	1
grew	1
red	1
and	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
perspiration.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
hungry	1
and	1
shared	1
the	1
dinner	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
Morel,	1
the	1
orderly,	1
brought	1
some	1
hot	1
water	1
in	1
a	1
saucepan	1
and	1
placed	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
claret	1
in	1
it.	1
He	1
also	1
brought	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
kvass,	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
kitchen	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
try.	1
That	1
beverage	1
was	1
already	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
a	1
special	1
name.	1
They	1
called	1
it	1
limonade	1
de	1
cochon	1
(pig's	1
lemonade),	1
and	1
Morel	1
spoke	1
well	1
of	1
the	1
limonade	1
de	1
cochon	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
captain	1
had	1
the	1
wine	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
while	1
passing	1
through	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
kvass	1
to	1
Morel	1
and	1
applied	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
bottle	1
of	1
Bordeaux.	1
He	1
wrapped	1
the	1
bottle	1
up	1
to	1
its	1
neck	1
in	1
a	1
table	1
napkin	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
wine	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
for	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
his	1
hunger	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
rendered	1
the	1
captain	1
still	1
more	1
lively	1
and	1
he	1
chatted	1
incessantly	1
all	1
through	1
dinner.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
dear	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
I	1
owe	1
you	1
a	1
fine	1
votive	1
candle	1
for	1
saving	1
me	1
from	1
that	1
maniac....	1
You	1
see,	1
I	1
have	1
bullets	1
enough	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
already.	1
Here	1
is	1
one	1
I	1
got	1
at	1
Wagram"	1
(he	1
touched	1
his	1
side)	1
"and	1
a	1
second	1
at	1
Smolensk"--he	1
showed	1
a	1
scar	1
on	1
his	1
cheek--"and	1
this	1
leg	1
which	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
march,	1
I	1
got	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
at	1
the	1
great	1
battle	1
of	1
la	1
Moskowa.	1
Sacre	1
Dieu!	1
It	1
was	1
splendid!	1
That	1
deluge	1
of	1
fire	1
was	1
worth	1
seeing.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
tough	1
job	1
you	1
set	1
us	1
there,	1
my	1
word!	1
You	1
may	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
it!	1
And	1
on	1
my	1
honor,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
cough	1
I	1
caught	1
there,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
begin	1
again.	1
I	1
pity	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
there,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Bah,	1
really?	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better!	1
You	1
are	1
certainly	1
brave	1
foes.	1
The	1
great	1
redoubt	1
held	1
out	1
well,	1
by	1
my	1
pipe!"	1
continued	1
the	1
Frenchman.	1
"And	1
you	1
made	1
us	1
pay	1
dear	1
for	1
it.	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
it	1
three	1
times--sure	1
as	1
I	1
sit	1
here.	1
Three	1
times	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
three	1
times	1
we	1
were	1
thrown	1
back	1
like	1
cardboard	1
figures.	1
Oh,	1
it	1
was	1
beautiful,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre!	1
Your	1
grenadiers	1
were	1
splendid,	1
by	1
heaven!	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
close	1
up	1
their	1
ranks	1
six	1
times	1
in	1
succession	1
and	1
march	1
as	1
if	1
on	1
parade.	1
Fine	1
fellows!	1
Our	1
King	1
of	1
Naples,	1
who	1
knows	1
what's	1
what,	1
cried	1
'Bravo!'	1
Ha,	1
ha!	1
So	1
you	1
are	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
soldiers!"	1
he	1
added,	1
smiling,	1
after	1
a	1
momentary	1
pause.	1
"So	1
much	1
the	1
better,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre!	1
Terrible	1
in	1
battle...	1
gallant...	1
with	1
the	1
fair"	1
(he	1
winked	1
and	1
smiled),	1
"that's	1
what	1
the	1
French	1
are,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
aren't	1
they?"	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
was	1
so	1
naively	1
and	1
good-humoredly	1
gay,	1
so	1
real,	1
and	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
himself	1
that	1
Pierre	1
almost	1
winked	1
back	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
merrily	1
at	1
him.	1
Probably	1
the	1
word	1
"gallant"	1
turned	1
the	1
captain's	1
thoughts	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"Apropos,	1
tell	1
me	1
please,	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
women	1
have	1
all	1
left	1
Moscow?	1
What	1
a	1
queer	1
idea!	1
What	1
had	1
they	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of?"	1
	1
"Would	1
not	1
the	1
French	1
ladies	1
leave	1
Paris	1
if	1
the	1
Russians	1
entered	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!"	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
emitted	1
a	1
merry,	1
sanguine	1
chuckle,	1
patting	1
Pierre	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
"What	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
say!"	1
he	1
exclaimed.	1
"Paris?...	1
But	1
Paris,	1
Paris..."	1
	1
"Paris--the	1
capital	1
of	1
the	1
world,"	1
Pierre	1
finished	1
his	1
remark	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
stopping	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
talk	1
and	1
gazing	1
intently	1
with	1
his	1
laughing,	1
kindly	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Well,	1
if	1
you	1
hadn't	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
were	1
Russian,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
wagered	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
Parisian!	1
You	1
have	1
that...	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what,	1
that..."	1
and	1
having	1
uttered	1
this	1
compliment,	1
he	1
again	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
Paris.	1
I	1
spent	1
years	1
there,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
one	1
sees	1
that	1
plainly.	1
Paris!...	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
doesn't	1
know	1
Paris	1
is	1
a	1
savage.	1
You	1
can	1
tell	1
a	1
Parisian	1
two	1
leagues	1
off.	1
Paris	1
is	1
Talma,	1
la	1
Duchenois,	1
Potier,	1
the	1
Sorbonne,	1
the	1
boulevards,"	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
his	1
conclusion	1
was	1
weaker	1
than	1
what	1
had	1
gone	1
before,	1
he	1
added	1
quickly:	1
"There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
Paris	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
Paris	1
and	1
have	1
remained	1
Russian.	1
Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
esteem	1
you	1
the	1
less	1
for	1
it."	1
	1
Under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
depressing	1
thoughts,	1
Pierre	1
involuntarily	1
enjoyed	1
talking	1
with	1
this	1
cheerful	1
and	1
good-natured	1
man.	1
	1
"To	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
ladies--I	1
hear	1
they	1
are	1
lovely.	1
What	1
a	1
wretched	1
idea	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
bury	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
steppes	1
when	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
is	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
What	1
a	1
chance	1
those	1
girls	1
have	1
missed!	1
Your	1
peasants,	1
now--	1
that's	1
another	1
thing;	1
but	1
you	1
civilized	1
people,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
us	1
better	1
than	1
that.	1
We	1
took	1
Vienna,	1
Berlin,	1
Madrid,	1
Naples,	1
Rome,	1
Warsaw,	1
all	1
the	1
world's	1
capitals....	1
We	1
are	1
feared,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
loved.	1
We	1
are	1
nice	1
to	1
know.	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
Emperor..."	1
he	1
began,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor,"	1
Pierre	1
repeated,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
suddenly	1
became	1
sad	1
and	1
embarrassed,	1
"is	1
the	1
Emperor...?"	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor?	1
He	1
is	1
generosity,	1
mercy,	1
justice,	1
order,	1
genius--that's	1
what	1
the	1
Emperor	1
is!	1
It	1
is	1
I,	1
Ramballe,	1
who	1
tell	1
you	1
so....	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
was	1
his	1
enemy	1
eight	1
years	1
ago.	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
an	1
emigrant	1
count....	1
But	1
that	1
man	1
has	1
vanquished	1
me.	1
He	1
has	1
taken	1
hold	1
of	1
me.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
grandeur	1
and	1
glory	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
covered	1
France.	1
When	1
I	1
understood	1
what	1
he	1
wanted--when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
laurels	1
for	1
us,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
myself:	1
'That	1
is	1
a	1
monarch,'	1
and	1
I	1
devoted	1
myself	1
to	1
him!	1
So	1
there!	1
Oh	1
yes,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
ages	1
past	1
or	1
future."	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
Pierre	1
stammered	1
with	1
a	1
guilty	1
look.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
guilty	1
face	1
and	1
smiled.	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
his	1
entry	1
tomorrow,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
and	1
continued	1
his	1
talk.	1
	1
Their	1
conversation	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
several	1
voices	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
by	1
Morel,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
some	1
Wurttemberg	1
hussars	1
had	1
come	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
their	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
where	1
the	1
captain's	1
horses	1
were.	1
This	1
difficulty	1
had	1
arisen	1
chiefly	1
because	1
the	1
hussars	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
had	1
their	1
senior	1
sergeant	1
called	1
in,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
stern	1
voice	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
what	1
regiment	1
he	1
belonged,	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
commanding	1
officer,	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
right	1
he	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
claim	1
quarters	1
that	1
were	1
already	1
occupied.	1
The	1
German	1
who	1
knew	1
little	1
French,	1
answered	1
the	1
two	1
first	1
questions	1
by	1
giving	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
commanding	1
officer,	1
but	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
question	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
said,	1
introducing	1
broken	1
French	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
German,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
his	1
commander	1
had	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
occupy	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
one	1
after	1
another.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
knew	1
German,	1
translated	1
what	1
the	1
German	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
captain's	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
Wurttemberg	1
hussar	1
in	1
German.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
the	1
German	1
submitted	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
men	1
elsewhere.	1
The	1
captain	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
gave	1
some	1
orders	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
as	1
before,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
His	1
face	1
expressed	1
suffering.	1
He	1
really	1
was	1
suffering	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
When	1
the	1
captain	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
alone,	1
suddenly	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
realized	1
the	1
position	1
he	1
was	1
in.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
happy	1
conquerors	1
were	1
masters	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
were	1
patronizing	1
him.	1
Painful	1
as	1
that	1
was	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
tormented	1
Pierre	1
at	1
the	1
moment.	1
He	1
was	1
tormented	1
by	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
weakness.	1
The	1
few	1
glasses	1
of	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
this	1
good-natured	1
man	1
had	1
destroyed	1
the	1
mood	1
of	1
concentrated	1
gloom	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
essential	1
for	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
design.	1
The	1
pistol,	1
dagger,	1
and	1
peasant	1
coat	1
were	1
ready.	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
town	1
next	1
day.	1
Pierre	1
still	1
considered	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
useful	1
and	1
worthy	1
action	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
evildoer,	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
it.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
why,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
foreboding	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
intention.	1
He	1
struggled	1
against	1
the	1
confession	1
of	1
his	1
weakness	1
but	1
dimly	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
overcome	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
former	1
gloomy	1
frame	1
of	1
mind,	1
concerning	1
vengeance,	1
killing,	1
and	1
self-	1
sacrifice,	1
had	1
been	1
dispersed	1
like	1
dust	1
by	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
he	1
met.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
room,	1
limping	1
slightly	1
and	1
whistling	1
a	1
tune.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman's	1
chatter	1
which	1
had	1
previously	1
amused	1
Pierre	1
now	1
repelled	1
him.	1
The	1
tune	1
he	1
was	1
whistling,	1
his	1
gait,	1
and	1
the	1
gesture	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
twirled	1
his	1
mustache,	1
all	1
now	1
seemed	1
offensive.	1
"I	1
will	1
go	1
away	1
immediately.	1
I	1
won't	1
say	1
another	1
word	1
to	1
him,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
thought	1
this,	1
but	1
still	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place.	1
A	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
weakness	1
tied	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
spot;	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
go	1
away,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
The	1
captain,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
seemed	1
very	1
cheerful.	1
He	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
twice.	1
His	1
eyes	1
shone	1
and	1
his	1
mustache	1
twitched	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
smiling	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
some	1
amusing	1
thought.	1
	1
"The	1
colonel	1
of	1
those	1
Wurttembergers	1
is	1
delightful,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
said.	1
"He's	1
a	1
German,	1
but	1
a	1
nice	1
fellow	1
all	1
the	1
same....	1
But	1
he's	1
a	1
German."	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
facing	1
Pierre.	1
"By	1
the	1
way,	1
you	1
know	1
German,	1
then?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
German	1
for	1
'shelter'?"	1
	1
"Shelter?"	1
Pierre	1
repeated.	1
"The	1
German	1
for	1
shelter	1
is	1
Unterkunft."	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
it?"	1
the	1
captain	1
asked	1
quickly	1
and	1
doubtfully.	1
	1
"Unterkunft,"	1
Pierre	1
repeated.	1
	1
"Onterkoff,"	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
for	1
some	1
seconds	1
with	1
laughing	1
eyes.	1
"These	1
Germans	1
are	1
first-rate	1
fools,	1
don't	1
you	1
think	1
so,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre?"	1
he	1
concluded.	1
	1
"Well,	1
let's	1
have	1
another	1
bottle	1
of	1
this	1
Moscow	1
Bordeaux,	1
shall	1
we?	1
Morel	1
will	1
warm	1
us	1
up	1
another	1
little	1
bottle.	1
Morel!"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
gaily.	1
	1
Morel	1
brought	1
candles	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine.	1
The	1
captain	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
by	1
the	1
candlelight	1
and	1
was	1
evidently	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
troubled	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
companion's	1
face.	1
Ramballe,	1
with	1
genuine	1
distress	1
and	1
sympathy	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
bent	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
we're	1
sad,"	1
said	1
he,	1
touching	1
Pierre's	1
hand.	1
"Have	1
I	1
upset	1
you?	1
No,	1
really,	1
have	1
you	1
anything	1
against	1
me?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
"Perhaps	1
it's	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
affairs?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
but	1
looked	1
cordially	1
into	1
the	1
Frenchman's	1
eyes	1
whose	1
expression	1
of	1
sympathy	1
was	1
pleasing	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Honestly,	1
without	1
speaking	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
owe	1
you,	1
I	1
feel	1
friendship	1
for	1
you.	1
Can	1
I	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
you?	1
Dispose	1
of	1
me.	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
life	1
and	1
death.	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
heart!"	1
said	1
he,	1
striking	1
his	1
chest.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
gazed	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
"shelter"	1
was	1
Unterkunft	1
in	1
German,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
suddenly	1
brightened.	1
	1
"Well,	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
I	1
drink	1
to	1
our	1
friendship!"	1
he	1
cried	1
gaily,	1
filling	1
two	1
glasses	1
with	1
wine.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
glasses	1
and	1
emptied	1
it.	1
Ramballe	1
emptied	1
his	1
too,	1
again	1
pressed	1
Pierre's	1
hand,	1
and	1
leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
pensive	1
attitude.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,"	1
he	1
began,	1
"such	1
is	1
fortune's	1
caprice.	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
soldier	1
and	1
a	1
captain	1
of	1
dragoons	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
Bonaparte,	1
as	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
him?	1
Yet	1
here	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
Moscow	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
he	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
sad	1
and	1
measured	1
tones	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
intends	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
long	1
story,	1
"that	1
our	1
name	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
ancient	1
in	1
France."	1
	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
Frenchman's	1
easy	1
and	1
naive	1
frankness	1
the	1
captain	1
told	1
Pierre	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
ancestors,	1
his	1
childhood,	1
youth,	1
and	1
manhood,	1
and	1
all	1
about	1
his	1
relations	1
and	1
his	1
financial	1
and	1
family	1
affairs,	1
"ma	1
pauvre	1
mere"	1
playing	1
of	1
course	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
story.	1
	1
"But	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
life's	1
setting,	1
the	1
real	1
thing	1
is	1
love--love!	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
right,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre?"	1
said	1
he,	1
growing	1
animated.	1
"Another	1
glass?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
again	1
emptied	1
his	1
glass	1
and	1
poured	1
himself	1
out	1
a	1
third.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
women,	1
women!"	1
and	1
the	1
captain,	1
looking	1
with	1
glistening	1
eyes	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
began	1
talking	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
affairs.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
very	1
many	1
of	1
these,	1
as	1
one	1
could	1
easily	1
believe,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
officer's	1
handsome,	1
self-satisfied	1
face,	1
and	1
noting	1
the	1
eager	1
enthusiasm	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
women.	1
Though	1
all	1
Ramballe's	1
love	1
stories	1
had	1
the	1
sensual	1
character	1
which	1
Frenchmen	1
regard	1
as	1
the	1
special	1
charm	1
and	1
poetry	1
of	1
love,	1
yet	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
story	1
with	1
such	1
sincere	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
had	1
experienced	1
and	1
known	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
he	1
described	1
women	1
so	1
alluringly	1
that	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
curiosity.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
l'amour	1
which	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
was	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
low	1
and	1
simple	1
kind	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
once	1
felt	1
for	1
his	1
wife,	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
the	1
romantic	1
love	1
stimulated	1
by	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
experienced	1
for	1
Natasha.	1
(Ramballe	1
despised	1
both	1
these	1
kinds	1
of	1
love	1
equally:	1
the	1
one	1
he	1
considered	1
the	1
"love	1
of	1
clodhoppers"	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
"love	1
of	1
simpletons.")	1
L'amour	1
which	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
worshiped	1
consisted	1
principally	1
in	1
the	1
unnaturalness	1
of	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
incongruities	1
giving	1
the	1
chief	1
charm	1
to	1
the	1
feeling.	1
	1
Thus	1
the	1
captain	1
touchingly	1
recounted	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
fascinating	1
marquise	1
of	1
thirty-five	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
charming,	1
innocent	1
child	1
of	1
seventeen,	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
bewitching	1
marquise.	1
The	1
conflict	1
of	1
magnanimity	1
between	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
daughter,	1
ending	1
in	1
the	1
mother's	1
sacrificing	1
herself	1
and	1
offering	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
marriage	1
to	1
her	1
lover,	1
even	1
now	1
agitated	1
the	1
captain,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
a	1
distant	1
past.	1
Then	1
he	1
recounted	1
an	1
episode	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
husband	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
lover,	1
and	1
he--the	1
lover--assumed	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
the	1
husband,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
several	1
droll	1
incidents	1
from	1
his	1
recollections	1
of	1
Germany,	1
where	1
"shelter"	1
is	1
called	1
Unterkunft	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
husbands	1
eat	1
sauerkraut	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
girls	1
are	1
"too	1
blonde."	1
	1
Finally,	1
the	1
latest	1
episode	1
in	1
Poland	1
still	1
fresh	1
in	1
the	1
captain's	1
memory,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
narrated	1
with	1
rapid	1
gestures	1
and	1
glowing	1
face,	1
was	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
saved	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
Pole	1
(in	1
general,	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
life	1
continually	1
occurred	1
in	1
the	1
captain's	1
stories)	1
and	1
the	1
Pole	1
had	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
enchanting	1
wife	1
(parisienne	1
de	1
coeur)	1
while	1
himself	1
entering	1
the	1
French	1
service.	1
The	1
captain	1
was	1
happy,	1
the	1
enchanting	1
Polish	1
lady	1
wished	1
to	1
elope	1
with	1
him,	1
but,	1
prompted	1
by	1
magnanimity,	1
the	1
captain	1
restored	1
the	1
wife	1
to	1
the	1
husband,	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so:	1
"I	1
have	1
saved	1
your	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
save	1
your	1
honor!"	1
Having	1
repeated	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
captain	1
wiped	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
a	1
shake,	1
as	1
if	1
driving	1
away	1
the	1
weakness	1
which	1
assailed	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
touching	1
recollection.	1
	1
Listening	1
to	1
the	1
captain's	1
tales,	1
Pierre--as	1
often	1
happens	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
wine--followed	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
told	1
him,	1
understood	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
followed	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
personal	1
memories	1
which,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
why,	1
suddenly	1
arose	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
While	1
listening	1
to	1
these	1
love	1
stories	1
his	1
own	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha	1
unexpectedly	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
going	1
over	1
the	1
pictures	1
of	1
that	1
love	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
he	1
mentally	1
compared	1
them	1
with	1
Ramballe's	1
tales.	1
Listening	1
to	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
struggle	1
between	1
love	1
and	1
duty,	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
every	1
minutest	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
last	1
meeting	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
at	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
water	1
tower.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
that	1
meeting	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
upon	1
him--he	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
once	1
recalled	1
it.	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
that	1
meeting	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
it	1
something	1
very	1
important	1
and	1
poetic.	1
	1
"Peter	1
Kirilovich,	1
come	1
here!	1
We	1
have	1
recognized	1
you,"	1
he	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
had	1
uttered	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
before	1
him	1
her	1
eyes,	1
her	1
smile,	1
her	1
traveling	1
hood,	1
and	1
a	1
stray	1
lock	1
of	1
her	1
hair...	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
something	1
pathetic	1
and	1
touching	1
in	1
all	1
this.	1
	1
Having	1
finished	1
his	1
tale	1
about	1
the	1
enchanting	1
Polish	1
lady,	1
the	1
captain	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
experienced	1
a	1
similar	1
impulse	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
himself	1
for	1
love	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
envy	1
of	1
the	1
legitimate	1
husband.	1
	1
Challenged	1
by	1
this	1
question	1
Pierre	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
women	1
somewhat	1
differently.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
loved	1
and	1
still	1
loved	1
only	1
one	1
woman,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
his.	1
	1
"Tiens!"	1
said	1
the	1
captain.	1
	1
Pierre	1
then	1
explained	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
loved	1
this	1
woman	1
from	1
his	1
earliest	1
years,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
dared	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
young,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
without	1
a	1
name.	1
Afterwards	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
wealth	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
too	1
well,	1
placing	1
her	1
far	1
above	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
especially	1
therefore	1
above	1
himself.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
this	1
point,	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
the	1
captain	1
whether	1
he	1
understood	1
that.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
signifying	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
it	1
he	1
begged	1
Pierre	1
to	1
continue.	1
	1
"Platonic	1
love,	1
clouds..."	1
he	1
muttered.	1
	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk,	1
or	1
an	1
impulse	1
of	1
frankness,	1
or	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
did	1
not,	1
and	1
never	1
would,	1
know	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
played	1
a	1
part	1
in	1
his	1
story,	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
together,	1
something	1
loosened	1
Pierre's	1
tongue.	1
Speaking	1
thickly	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
faraway	1
look	1
in	1
his	1
shining	1
eyes,	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
life:	1
his	1
marriage,	1
Natasha's	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
best	1
friend,	1
her	1
betrayal	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
simple	1
relations	1
with	1
her.	1
Urged	1
on	1
by	1
Ramballe's	1
questions	1
he	1
also	1
told	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
concealed--his	1
own	1
position	1
and	1
even	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
More	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
story	1
the	1
captain	1
was	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Pierre	1
was	1
very	1
rich,	1
had	1
two	1
mansions	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
abandoned	1
everything	1
and	1
not	1
left	1
the	1
city,	1
but	1
remained	1
there	1
concealing	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
station.	1
	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
at	1
night	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
warm	1
and	1
light.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Pokrovka	1
a	1
fire	1
glowed--the	1
first	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
beginning	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
To	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
high	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
the	1
sickle	1
of	1
the	1
waning	1
moon	1
and	1
opposite	1
to	1
it	1
hung	1
that	1
bright	1
comet	1
which	1
was	1
connected	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
heart	1
with	1
his	1
love.	1
At	1
the	1
gate	1
stood	1
Gerasim,	1
the	1
cook,	1
and	1
two	1
Frenchmen.	1
Their	1
laughter	1
and	1
their	1
mutually	1
incomprehensible	1
remarks	1
in	1
two	1
languages	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
They	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
glow	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
terrible	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
small,	1
distant	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
immense	1
city.	1
	1
Gazing	1
at	1
the	1
high	1
starry	1
sky,	1
at	1
the	1
moon,	1
at	1
the	1
comet,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
glow	1
from	1
the	1
fire,	1
Pierre	1
experienced	1
a	1
joyful	1
emotion.	1
"There	1
now,	1
how	1
good	1
it	1
is,	1
what	1
more	1
does	1
one	1
need?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
remembering	1
his	1
intention	1
he	1
grew	1
dizzy	1
and	1
felt	1
so	1
faint	1
that	1
he	1
leaned	1
against	1
the	1
fence	1
to	1
save	1
himself	1
from	1
falling.	1
	1
Without	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
friend,	1
Pierre	1
left	1
the	1
gate	1
with	1
unsteady	1
steps	1
and	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
immediately	1
fell	1
asleep.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXX	1
	1
The	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
fire	1
that	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September	1
was	1
watched	1
from	1
the	1
various	1
roads	1
by	1
the	1
fugitive	1
Muscovites	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
retreating	1
troops,	1
with	1
many	1
different	1
feelings.	1
	1
The	1
Rostov	1
party	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
Mytishchi,	1
fourteen	1
miles	1
from	1
Moscow.	1
They	1
had	1
started	1
so	1
late	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
the	1
road	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
blocked	1
by	1
vehicles	1
and	1
troops,	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
for	1
which	1
servants	1
were	1
sent	1
back,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
spend	1
that	1
night	1
at	1
a	1
place	1
three	1
miles	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
they	1
woke	1
late	1
and	1
were	1
again	1
delayed	1
so	1
often	1
that	1
they	1
only	1
got	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Great	1
Mytishchi.	1
At	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
that	1
evening	1
the	1
Rostov	1
family	1
and	1
the	1
wounded	1
traveling	1
with	1
them	1
were	1
all	1
distributed	1
in	1
the	1
yards	1
and	1
huts	1
of	1
that	1
large	1
village.	1
The	1
Rostovs'	1
servants	1
and	1
coachmen	1
and	1
the	1
orderlies	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
officers,	1
after	1
attending	1
to	1
their	1
masters,	1
had	1
supper,	1
fed	1
the	1
horses,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porches.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
neighboring	1
hut	1
lay	1
Raevski's	1
adjutant	1
with	1
a	1
fractured	1
wrist.	1
The	1
awful	1
pain	1
he	1
suffered	1
made	1
him	1
moan	1
incessantly	1
and	1
piteously,	1
and	1
his	1
moaning	1
sounded	1
terrible	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
autumn	1
night.	1
He	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
first	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
yard	1
as	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
The	1
countess	1
said	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
close	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
moaning,	1
and	1
at	1
Mytishchi	1
she	1
moved	1
into	1
a	1
worse	1
hut	1
simply	1
to	1
be	1
farther	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wounded	1
man.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
noticed,	1
above	1
the	1
high	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
coach	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
porch,	1
the	1
small	1
glow	1
of	1
another	1
fire.	1
One	1
glow	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
visible	1
and	1
everybody	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Little	1
Mytishchi	1
burning--set	1
on	1
fire	1
by	1
Mamonov's	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
"But	1
look	1
here,	1
brothers,	1
there's	1
another	1
fire!"	1
remarked	1
an	1
orderly.	1
	1
All	1
turned	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
glow.	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
told	1
us	1
Little	1
Mytishchi	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
by	1
Mamonov's	1
Cossacks."	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
not	1
Mytishchi,	1
it's	1
farther	1
away."	1
	1
"Look,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
Moscow!"	1
	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
gazers	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
its	1
steps.	1
	1
"It's	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
why,	1
Little	1
Mytishchi	1
is	1
over	1
there,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
right	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side."	1
	1
Several	1
men	1
joined	1
the	1
first	1
two.	1
	1
"See	1
how	1
it's	1
flaring,"	1
said	1
one.	1
"That's	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
Moscow:	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
Sushchevski	1
or	1
the	1
Rogozhski	1
quarter."	1
	1
No	1
one	1
replied	1
to	1
this	1
remark	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
they	1
all	1
gazed	1
silently	1
at	1
the	1
spreading	1
flames	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
	1
Old	1
Daniel	1
Terentich,	1
the	1
count's	1
valet	1
(as	1
he	1
was	1
called),	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
group	1
and	1
shouted	1
at	1
Mishka.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
staring	1
at,	1
you	1
good-for-nothing?...	1
The	1
count	1
will	1
be	1
calling	1
and	1
there's	1
nobody	1
there;	1
go	1
and	1
gather	1
the	1
clothes	1
together."	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
water,"	1
said	1
Mishka.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Daniel	1
Terentich?	1
Doesn't	1
it	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
glow	1
were	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
remarked	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
footmen.	1
	1
Daniel	1
Terentich	1
made	1
no	1
reply,	1
and	1
again	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
silent.	1
The	1
glow	1
spread,	1
rising	1
and	1
falling,	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
still.	1
	1
"God	1
have	1
mercy....	1
It's	1
windy	1
and	1
dry..."	1
said	1
another	1
voice.	1
	1
"Just	1
look!	1
See	1
what	1
it's	1
doing	1
now.	1
O	1
Lord!	1
You	1
can	1
even	1
see	1
the	1
crows	1
flying.	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
sinners!"	1
	1
"They'll	1
put	1
it	1
out,	1
no	1
fear!"	1
	1
"Who's	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
out?"	1
Daniel	1
Terentich,	1
who	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
silent,	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
say.	1
His	1
voice	1
was	1
calm	1
and	1
deliberate.	1
"Moscow	1
it	1
is,	1
brothers,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Mother	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
white..."	1
his	1
voice	1
faltered,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
man's	1
sob.	1
	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
only	1
waited	1
for	1
this	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
significance	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
glow	1
they	1
were	1
watching.	1
Sighs	1
were	1
heard,	1
words	1
of	1
prayer,	1
and	1
the	1
sobbing	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
old	1
valet.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXXI	1
	1
The	1
valet,	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
cottage,	1
informed	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
burning.	1
The	1
count	1
donned	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
look.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
undressed,	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
Only	1
Natasha	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
Petya	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
with	1
the	1
family,	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
regiment	1
which	1
was	1
making	1
for	1
Troitsa.	1
	1
The	1
countess,	1
on	1
hearing	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
on	1
fire,	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
Natasha,	1
pale,	1
with	1
a	1
fixed	1
look,	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
under	1
the	1
icons	1
just	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
arriving	1
and	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
father's	1
words.	1
She	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
moaning	1
of	1
the	1
adjutant,	1
three	1
houses	1
off.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
terrible,"	1
said	1
Sonya	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
yard	1
chilled	1
and	1
frightened.	1
"I	1
believe	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
Moscow	1
will	1
burn,	1
there's	1
an	1
awful	1
glow!	1
Natasha,	1
do	1
look!	1
You	1
can	1
see	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
window,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
cousin,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
distract	1
her	1
mind.	1
	1
But	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
understanding	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
again	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
stove.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
this	1
condition	1
of	1
stupor	1
since	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
Sonya,	1
to	1
the	1
surprise	1
and	1
annoyance	1
of	1
the	1
countess,	1
had	1
for	1
some	1
unaccountable	1
reason	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
tell	1
Natasha	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
wound	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
with	1
their	1
party.	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
seldom	1
been	1
so	1
angry	1
with	1
anyone	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
Sonya.	1
Sonya	1
had	1
cried	1
and	1
begged	1
to	1
be	1
forgiven	1
and	1
now,	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
her	1
fault,	1
paid	1
unceasing	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
cousin.	1
	1
"Look,	1
Natasha,	1
how	1
dreadfully	1
it	1
is	1
burning!"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"What's	1
burning?"	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
Moscow."	1
	1
And	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
offend	1
Sonya	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
her,	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
looked	1
out	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
anything,	1
and	1
again	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
attitude.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
didn't	1
see	1
it!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
really	1
I	1
did,"	1
Natasha	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
pleaded	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
Both	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
Sonya	1
understood	1
that,	1
naturally,	1
neither	1
Moscow	1
nor	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
nor	1
anything	1
else	1
could	1
seem	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
returned	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
behind	1
the	1
partition.	1
The	1
countess	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
touched	1
her	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
Natasha	1
was	1
ill,	1
then	1
touched	1
her	1
forehead	1
with	1
her	1
lips	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
feel	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
feverish,	1
and	1
finally	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
cold.	1
You	1
are	1
trembling	1
all	1
over.	1
You'd	1
better	1
lie	1
down,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Lie	1
down?	1
All	1
right,	1
I	1
will.	1
I'll	1
lie	1
down	1
at	1
once,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
When	1
Natasha	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
morning	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
seriously	1
wounded	1
and	1
was	1
traveling	1
with	1
their	1
party,	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
asked	1
many	1
questions:	1
Where	1
was	1
he	1
going?	1
How	1
was	1
he	1
wounded?	1
Was	1
it	1
serious?	1
And	1
could	1
she	1
see	1
him?	1
But	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
seriously	1
wounded	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
danger,	1
she	1
ceased	1
to	1
ask	1
questions	1
or	1
to	1
speak	1
at	1
all,	1
evidently	1
disbelieving	1
what	1
they	1
told	1
her,	1
and	1
convinced	1
that	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
might	1
she	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
told	1
the	1
same.	1
All	1
the	1
way	1
she	1
had	1
sat	1
motionless	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
with	1
wide	1
open	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
in	1
them	1
which	1
the	1
countess	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
feared	1
so	1
much,	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
seated	1
herself	1
on	1
arriving.	1
She	1
was	1
planning	1
something	1
and	1
either	1
deciding	1
or	1
had	1
already	1
decided	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
mind.	1
The	1
countess	1
knew	1
this,	1
but	1
what	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
and	1
this	1
alarmed	1
and	1
tormented	1
her.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
undress,	1
darling;	1
lie	1
down	1
on	1
my	1
bed."	1
	1
A	1
bed	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
on	1
a	1
bedstead	1
for	1
the	1
countess	1
only.	1
Madame	1
Schoss	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
were	1
to	1
sleep	1
on	1
some	1
hay	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
"No,	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
will	1
lie	1
down	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
floor,"	1
Natasha	1
replied	1
irritably	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
opened	1
it.	1
Through	1
the	1
open	1
window	1
the	1
moans	1
of	1
the	1
adjutant	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
more	1
distinctly.	1
She	1
put	1
her	1
head	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
damp	1
night	1
air,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
saw	1
her	1
slim	1
neck	1
shaking	1
with	1
sobs	1
and	1
throbbing	1
against	1
the	1
window	1
frame.	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
who	1
was	1
moaning.	1
She	1
knew	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
yard	1
as	1
themselves	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
across	1
the	1
passage;	1
but	1
this	1
dreadful	1
incessant	1
moaning	1
made	1
her	1
sob.	1
The	1
countess	1
exchanged	1
a	1
look	1
with	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Lie	1
down,	1
darling;	1
lie	1
down,	1
my	1
pet,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
softly	1
touching	1
Natasha's	1
shoulders.	1
"Come,	1
lie	1
down."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes...	1
I'll	1
lie	1
down	1
at	1
once,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
began	1
hurriedly	1
undressing,	1
tugging	1
at	1
the	1
tapes	1
of	1
her	1
petticoat.	1
	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
thrown	1
off	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
dressing	1
jacket,	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
foot	1
under	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
jerked	1
her	1
thin	1
and	1
rather	1
short	1
plait	1
of	1
hair	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
and	1
began	1
replaiting	1
it.	1
Her	1
long,	1
thin,	1
practiced	1
fingers	1
rapidly	1
unplaited,	1
replaited,	1
and	1
tied	1
up	1
her	1
plait.	1
Her	1
head	1
moved	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
from	1
habit,	1
but	1
her	1
eyes,	1
feverishly	1
wide,	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
before	1
her.	1
When	1
her	1
toilet	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
finished	1
she	1
sank	1
gently	1
onto	1
the	1
sheet	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
hay	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
nearest	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
you'd	1
better	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
middle,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"I'll	1
stay	1
here,"	1
muttered	1
Natasha.	1
"Do	1
lie	1
down,"	1
she	1
added	1
crossly,	1
and	1
buried	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
The	1
countess,	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
and	1
Sonya	1
undressed	1
hastily	1
and	1
lay	1
down.	1
The	1
small	1
lamp	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
icons	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
light	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
fire	1
at	1
Little	1
Mytishchi	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
away,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
people	1
shouting	1
at	1
a	1
tavern	1
Mamonov's	1
Cossacks	1
had	1
set	1
up	1
across	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
the	1
adjutant's	1
unceasing	1
moans	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Natasha	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
that	1
reached	1
her	1
from	1
inside	1
and	1
outside	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
First	1
she	1
heard	1
her	1
mother	1
praying	1
and	1
sighing	1
and	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
her	1
bed	1
under	1
her,	1
then	1
Madame	1
Schoss'	1
familiar	1
whistling	1
snore	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
gentle	1
breathing.	1
Then	1
the	1
countess	1
called	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
she's	1
asleep,	1
Mamma,"	1
said	1
Sonya	1
softly.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
the	1
countess	1
spoke	1
again	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
no	1
one	1
replied.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
that	1
Natasha	1
heard	1
her	1
mother's	1
even	1
breathing.	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
move,	1
though	1
her	1
little	1
bare	1
foot,	1
thrust	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
quilt,	1
was	1
growing	1
cold	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
floor.	1
	1
As	1
if	1
to	1
celebrate	1
a	1
victory	1
over	1
everybody,	1
a	1
cricket	1
chirped	1
in	1
a	1
crack	1
in	1
the	1
wall.	1
A	1
cock	1
crowed	1
far	1
off	1
and	1
another	1
replied	1
near	1
by.	1
The	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
tavern	1
had	1
died	1
down;	1
only	1
the	1
moaning	1
of	1
the	1
adjutant	1
was	1
heard.	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
up.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
are	1
you	1
asleep?	1
Mamma?"	1
she	1
whispered.	1
	1
No	1
one	1
replied.	1
Natasha	1
rose	1
slowly	1
and	1
carefully,	1
crossed	1
herself,	1
and	1
stepped	1
cautiously	1
on	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
dirty	1
floor	1
with	1
her	1
slim,	1
supple,	1
bare	1
feet.	1
The	1
boards	1
of	1
the	1
floor	1
creaked.	1
Stepping	1
cautiously	1
from	1
one	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
ran	1
like	1
a	1
kitten	1
the	1
few	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
grasped	1
the	1
cold	1
door	1
handle.	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
something	1
heavy	1
was	1
beating	1
rhythmically	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
room:	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
own	1
heart,	1
sinking	1
with	1
alarm	1
and	1
terror	1
and	1
overflowing	1
with	1
love.	1
	1
She	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
stepped	1
across	1
the	1
threshold	1
and	1
onto	1
the	1
cold,	1
damp	1
earthen	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
passage.	1
The	1
cold	1
she	1
felt	1
refreshed	1
her.	1
With	1
her	1
bare	1
feet	1
she	1
touched	1
a	1
sleeping	1
man,	1
stepped	1
over	1
him,	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
where	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lay.	1
It	1
was	1
dark	1
in	1
there.	1
In	1
the	1
farthest	1
corner,	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
beside	1
a	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
something	1
was	1
lying,	1
stood	1
a	1
tallow	1
candle	1
with	1
a	1
long,	1
thick,	1
and	1
smoldering	1
wick.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
morning	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
wound	1
and	1
his	1
presence	1
there,	1
Natasha	1
had	1
resolved	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
to,	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
meeting	1
would	1
be	1
painful,	1
but	1
felt	1
the	1
more	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary.	1
	1
All	1
day	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
only	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
that	1
night.	1
But	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
moment	1
had	1
come	1
she	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
dread	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
might	1
see.	1
How	1
was	1
he	1
maimed?	1
What	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
him?	1
Was	1
he	1
like	1
that	1
incessant	1
moaning	1
of	1
the	1
adjutant's?	1
Yes,	1
he	1
was	1
altogether	1
like	1
that.	1
In	1
her	1
imagination	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
terrible	1
moaning	1
personified.	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
an	1
indistinct	1
shape	1
in	1
the	1
corner,	1
and	1
mistook	1
his	1
knees	1
raised	1
under	1
the	1
quilt	1
for	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
she	1
imagined	1
a	1
horrible	1
body	1
there,	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
terror.	1
But	1
an	1
irresistible	1
impulse	1
drew	1
her	1
forward.	1
She	1
cautiously	1
took	1
one	1
step	1
and	1
then	1
another,	1
and	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
room	1
containing	1
baggage.	1
Another	1
man--Timokhin--was	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
on	1
the	1
benches	1
beneath	1
the	1
icons,	1
and	1
two	1
others--the	1
doctor	1
and	1
a	1
valet--lay	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
The	1
valet	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
whispered	1
something.	1
Timokhin,	1
kept	1
awake	1
by	1
the	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
wounded	1
leg,	1
gazed	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
at	1
this	1
strange	1
apparition	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
chemise,	1
dressing	1
jacket,	1
and	1
nightcap.	1
The	1
valet's	1
sleepy,	1
frightened	1
exclamation,	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want?	1
What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
made	1
Natasha	1
approach	1
more	1
swiftly	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
corner.	1
Horribly	1
unlike	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
that	1
body	1
looked,	1
she	1
must	1
see	1
him.	1
She	1
passed	1
the	1
valet,	1
the	1
snuff	1
fell	1
from	1
the	1
candle	1
wick,	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
clearly	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
outside	1
the	1
quilt,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
seen	1
him.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
ever,	1
but	1
the	1
feverish	1
color	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
his	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
rapturously	1
turned	1
toward	1
her,	1
and	1
especially	1
his	1
neck,	1
delicate	1
as	1
a	1
child's,	1
revealed	1
by	1
the	1
turn-down	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
shirt,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
innocent,	1
childlike	1
look,	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
on	1
him	1
before.	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
swift,	1
flexible,	1
youthful	1
movement	1
dropped	1
on	1
her	1
knees.	1
	1
He	1
smiled	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXXII	1
	1
Seven	1
days	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
ambulance	1
station	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
His	1
feverish	1
state	1
and	1
the	1
inflammation	1
of	1
his	1
bowels,	1
which	1
were	1
injured,	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
doctor's	1
opinion	1
sure	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
off.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
ate	1
with	1
pleasure	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
with	1
some	1
tea,	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
noticed	1
that	1
his	1
temperature	1
was	1
lower.	1
He	1
had	1
regained	1
consciousness	1
that	1
morning.	1
The	1
first	1
night	1
after	1
they	1
left	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
fairly	1
warm	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
caleche,	1
but	1
at	1
Mytishchi	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
himself	1
asked	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
and	1
given	1
some	1
tea.	1
The	1
pain	1
caused	1
by	1
his	1
removal	1
into	1
the	1
hut	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
groan	1
aloud	1
and	1
again	1
lose	1
consciousness.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
on	1
his	1
camp	1
bed	1
he	1
lay	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
motionless	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
he	1
opened	1
them	1
and	1
whispered	1
softly:	1
"And	1
the	1
tea?"	1
His	1
remembering	1
such	1
a	1
small	1
detail	1
of	1
everyday	1
life	1
astonished	1
the	1
doctor.	1
He	1
felt	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
pulse,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
and	1
dissatisfaction	1
found	1
it	1
had	1
improved.	1
He	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
if	1
his	1
patient	1
did	1
not	1
die	1
now,	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
so	1
a	1
little	1
later	1
with	1
greater	1
suffering.	1
Timokhin,	1
the	1
red-nosed	1
major	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
regiment,	1
had	1
joined	1
him	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
was	1
being	1
taken	1
along	1
with	1
him,	1
having	1
been	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
leg	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
They	1
were	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
doctor,	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
valet,	1
his	1
coachman,	1
and	1
two	1
orderlies.	1
	1
They	1
gave	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
some	1
tea.	1
He	1
drank	1
it	1
eagerly,	1
looking	1
with	1
feverish	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
remember	1
something.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
any	1
more.	1
Is	1
Timokhin	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
Timokhin	1
crept	1
along	1
the	1
bench	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
here,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"How's	1
your	1
wound?"	1
	1
"Mine,	1
sir?	1
All	1
right.	1
But	1
how	1
about	1
you?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again	1
pondered	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
something.	1
	1
"Couldn't	1
one	1
get	1
a	1
book?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"What	1
book?"	1
	1
"The	1
Gospels.	1
I	1
haven't	1
one."	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
promised	1
to	1
procure	1
it	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
feeling.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
answered	1
all	1
his	1
questions	1
reluctantly	1
but	1
reasonably,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
he	1
wanted	1
a	1
bolster	1
placed	1
under	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
pain.	1
The	1
doctor	1
and	1
valet	1
lifted	1
the	1
cloak	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
covered	1
and,	1
making	1
wry	1
faces	1
at	1
the	1
noisome	1
smell	1
of	1
mortifying	1
flesh	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
wound,	1
began	1
examining	1
that	1
dreadful	1
place.	1
The	1
doctor	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
displeased	1
about	1
something	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
dressings,	1
turning	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
over	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
groaned	1
again	1
and	1
grew	1
unconscious	1
and	1
delirious	1
from	1
the	1
agony.	1
He	1
kept	1
asking	1
them	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
trouble	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
you?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
one.	1
Please	1
get	1
it	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
for	1
a	1
moment,"	1
he	1
pleaded	1
in	1
a	1
piteous	1
voice.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
"You	1
fellows	1
have	1
no	1
conscience,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
valet	1
who	1
was	1
pouring	1
water	1
over	1
his	1
hands.	1
"For	1
just	1
one	1
moment	1
I	1
didn't	1
look	1
after	1
you...	1
It's	1
such	1
pain,	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
I	1
wonder	1
how	1
he	1
can	1
bear	1
it."	1
	1
"By	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
I	1
thought	1
we	1
had	1
put	1
something	1
under	1
him!"	1
said	1
the	1
valet.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
understood	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
remembered	1
being	1
wounded	1
and	1
how	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
hut	1
after	1
his	1
caleche	1
had	1
stopped	1
at	1
Mytishchi.	1
After	1
growing	1
confused	1
from	1
pain	1
while	1
being	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
hut	1
he	1
again	1
regained	1
consciousness,	1
and	1
while	1
drinking	1
tea	1
once	1
more	1
recalled	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
vividly	1
remembered	1
the	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
ambulance	1
station	1
when,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
disliked,	1
those	1
new	1
thoughts	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
promised	1
him	1
happiness.	1
And	1
those	1
thoughts,	1
though	1
now	1
vague	1
and	1
indefinite,	1
again	1
possessed	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
a	1
new	1
source	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
happiness	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
Gospels.	1
That	1
was	1
why	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
uncomfortable	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
put	1
him	1
and	1
turned	1
him	1
over	1
again	1
confused	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
complete	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
Everybody	1
near	1
him	1
was	1
sleeping.	1
A	1
cricket	1
chirped	1
from	1
across	1
the	1
passage;	1
someone	1
was	1
shouting	1
and	1
singing	1
in	1
the	1
street;	1
cockroaches	1
rustled	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
on	1
the	1
icons,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
a	1
big	1
fly	1
flopped	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
around	1
the	1
candle	1
beside	1
him,	1
the	1
wick	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
charred	1
and	1
had	1
shaped	1
itself	1
like	1
a	1
mushroom.	1
	1
His	1
mind	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
normal	1
state.	1
A	1
healthy	1
man	1
usually	1
thinks	1
of,	1
feels,	1
and	1
remembers	1
innumerable	1
things	1
simultaneously,	1
but	1
has	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
will	1
to	1
select	1
one	1
sequence	1
of	1
thoughts	1
or	1
events	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
fix	1
his	1
whole	1
attention.	1
A	1
healthy	1
man	1
can	1
tear	1
himself	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
deepest	1
reflections	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
civil	1
word	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
comes	1
in	1
and	1
can	1
then	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts.	1
But	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
mind	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
normal	1
state	1
in	1
that	1
respect.	1
All	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
were	1
more	1
active	1
and	1
clearer	1
than	1
ever,	1
but	1
they	1
acted	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
will.	1
Most	1
diverse	1
thoughts	1
and	1
images	1
occupied	1
him	1
simultaneously.	1
At	1
times	1
his	1
brain	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
a	1
vigor,	1
clearness,	1
and	1
depth	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
reached	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
health,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
its	1
work	1
it	1
would	1
turn	1
to	1
some	1
unexpected	1
idea	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
turn	1
it	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
new	1
happiness	1
was	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
which	1
man	1
cannot	1
be	1
deprived,"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
semidarkness	1
of	1
the	1
quiet	1
hut,	1
gazing	1
fixedly	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
feverish	1
wide	1
open	1
eyes.	1
"A	1
happiness	1
lying	1
beyond	1
material	1
forces,	1
outside	1
the	1
material	1
influences	1
that	1
act	1
on	1
man--a	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
alone,	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
loving.	1
Every	1
man	1
can	1
understand	1
it,	1
but	1
to	1
conceive	1
it	1
and	1
enjoin	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
only	1
for	1
God.	1
But	1
how	1
did	1
God	1
enjoin	1
that	1
law?	1
And	1
why	1
was	1
the	1
Son...?"	1
	1
And	1
suddenly	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
these	1
thoughts	1
broke	1
off,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
heard	1
(without	1
knowing	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
delusion	1
or	1
reality)	1
a	1
soft	1
whispering	1
voice	1
incessantly	1
and	1
rhythmically	1
repeating	1
"piti-piti-	1
piti,"	1
and	1
then	1
"titi,"	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
"piti-piti-piti,"	1
and	1
"ti-ti"	1
once	1
more.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
above	1
his	1
face,	1
above	1
the	1
very	1
middle	1
of	1
it,	1
some	1
strange	1
airy	1
structure	1
was	1
being	1
erected	1
out	1
of	1
slender	1
needles	1
or	1
splinters,	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
this	1
whispered	1
music.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
balance	1
carefully	1
(though	1
it	1
was	1
difficult)	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
airy	1
structure	1
should	1
not	1
collapse;	1
but	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
kept	1
collapsing	1
and	1
again	1
slowly	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
whispered	1
rhythmic	1
music--"it	1
stretches,	1
stretches,	1
spreading	1
out	1
and	1
stretching,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
himself.	1
While	1
listening	1
to	1
this	1
whispering	1
and	1
feeling	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
this	1
drawing	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
this	1
edifice	1
of	1
needles,	1
he	1
also	1
saw	1
by	1
glimpses	1
a	1
red	1
halo	1
round	1
the	1
candle,	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
the	1
cockroaches	1
and	1
the	1
buzzing	1
of	1
the	1
fly	1
that	1
flopped	1
against	1
his	1
pillow	1
and	1
his	1
face.	1
Each	1
time	1
the	1
fly	1
touched	1
his	1
face	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
burning	1
sensation	1
and	1
yet	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1
structure,	1
though	1
it	1
knocked	1
against	1
the	1
very	1
region	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
rising.	1
But	1
besides	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
else	1
of	1
importance.	1
It	1
was	1
something	1
white	1
by	1
the	1
door--the	1
statue	1
of	1
a	1
sphinx,	1
which	1
also	1
oppressed	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
that's	1
my	1
shirt	1
on	1
the	1
table,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"and	1
that's	1
my	1
legs,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
always	1
stretching	1
and	1
drawing	1
itself	1
out,	1
and	1
'piti-piti-piti'	1
and	1
'ti-ti'	1
and	1
'piti-piti-piti'...?	1
That's	1
enough,	1
please	1
leave	1
off!"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
painfully	1
entreated	1
someone.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
again	1
swam	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
with	1
peculiar	1
clearness	1
and	1
force.	1
	1
"Yes--love,"	1
he	1
thought	1
again	1
quite	1
clearly.	1
"But	1
not	1
love	1
which	1
loves	1
for	1
something,	1
for	1
some	1
quality,	1
for	1
some	1
purpose,	1
or	1
for	1
some	1
reason,	1
but	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
I--while	1
dying--first	1
experienced	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
my	1
enemy	1
and	1
yet	1
loved	1
him.	1
I	1
experienced	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
an	1
object.	1
Now	1
again	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
bliss.	1
To	1
love	1
one's	1
neighbors,	1
to	1
love	1
one's	1
enemies,	1
to	1
love	1
everything,	1
to	1
love	1
God	1
in	1
all	1
His	1
manifestations.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
love	1
someone	1
dear	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
human	1
love,	1
but	1
an	1
enemy	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
loved	1
by	1
divine	1
love.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
experienced	1
such	1
joy	1
when	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
loved	1
that	1
man.	1
What	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
him?	1
Is	1
he	1
alive?...	1
	1
"When	1
loving	1
with	1
human	1
love	1
one	1
may	1
pass	1
from	1
love	1
to	1
hatred,	1
but	1
divine	1
love	1
cannot	1
change.	1
No,	1
neither	1
death	1
nor	1
anything	1
else	1
can	1
destroy	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
soul.	1
Yet	1
how	1
many	1
people	1
have	1
I	1
hated	1
in	1
my	1
life?	1
And	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
I	1
loved	1
and	1
hated	1
none	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
her."	1
And	1
he	1
vividly	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
Natasha,	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
with	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
charms	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
delight,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
picturing	1
to	1
himself	1
her	1
soul.	1
And	1
he	1
understood	1
her	1
feelings,	1
her	1
sufferings,	1
shame,	1
and	1
remorse.	1
He	1
now	1
understood	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
all	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
his	1
rejection	1
of	1
her,	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
his	1
rupture	1
with	1
her.	1
"If	1
only	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
once	1
more!	1
Just	1
once,	1
looking	1
into	1
those	1
eyes	1
to	1
say..."	1
	1
"Piti-piti-piti	1
and	1
ti-ti	1
and	1
piti-piti-piti	1
boom!"	1
flopped	1
the	1
fly...	1
And	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
suddenly	1
carried	1
into	1
another	1
world,	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
reality	1
and	1
delirium	1
in	1
which	1
something	1
particular	1
was	1
happening.	1
In	1
that	1
world	1
some	1
structure	1
was	1
still	1
being	1
erected	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
fall,	1
something	1
was	1
still	1
stretching	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
candle	1
with	1
its	1
red	1
halo	1
was	1
still	1
burning,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
shirtlike	1
sphinx	1
lay	1
near	1
the	1
door;	1
but	1
besides	1
all	1
this	1
something	1
creaked,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
fresh	1
air,	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
white	1
sphinx	1
appeared,	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
And	1
that	1
sphinx	1
had	1
the	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
shining	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
Natasha	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
thinking.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
oppressive	1
this	1
continual	1
delirium	1
is,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
trying	1
to	1
drive	1
that	1
face	1
from	1
his	1
imagination.	1
But	1
the	1
face	1
remained	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
reality	1
and	1
drew	1
nearer.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
wished	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
that	1
former	1
world	1
of	1
pure	1
thought,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not,	1
and	1
delirium	1
drew	1
him	1
back	1
into	1
its	1
domain.	1
The	1
soft	1
whispering	1
voice	1
continued	1
its	1
rhythmic	1
murmur,	1
something	1
oppressed	1
him	1
and	1
stretched	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
face	1
was	1
before	1
him.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
collected	1
all	1
his	1
strength	1
in	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
senses,	1
he	1
moved	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
ringing	1
in	1
his	1
ears,	1
a	1
dimness	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
plunged	1
into	1
water	1
he	1
lost	1
consciousness.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
Natasha,	1
that	1
same	1
living	1
Natasha	1
whom	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
he	1
most	1
longed	1
to	1
love	1
with	1
this	1
new	1
pure	1
divine	1
love	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
him,	1
was	1
kneeling	1
before	1
him.	1
He	1
realized	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
living	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
but	1
quietly	1
happy.	1
Natasha,	1
motionless	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
(she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
stir),	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
riveted	1
on	1
him,	1
was	1
restraining	1
her	1
sobs.	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
rigid.	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
something	1
quivered.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sighed	1
with	1
relief,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"You?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"How	1
fortunate!"	1
	1
With	1
a	1
rapid	1
but	1
careful	1
movement	1
Natasha	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
and,	1
taking	1
his	1
hand	1
carefully,	1
bent	1
her	1
face	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
began	1
kissing	1
it,	1
just	1
touching	1
it	1
lightly	1
with	1
her	1
lips.	1
	1
"Forgive	1
me!"	1
she	1
whispered,	1
raising	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
him.	1
"Forgive	1
me!"	1
	1
"I	1
love	1
you,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Forgive...!"	1
	1
"Forgive	1
what?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
ha-ve	1
do-ne!"	1
faltered	1
Natasha	1
in	1
a	1
scarcely	1
audible,	1
broken	1
whisper,	1
and	1
began	1
kissing	1
his	1
hand	1
more	1
rapidly,	1
just	1
touching	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
lips.	1
	1
"I	1
love	1
you	1
more,	1
better	1
than	1
before,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
lifting	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
Those	1
eyes,	1
filled	1
with	1
happy	1
tears,	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
timidly,	1
compassionately,	1
and	1
with	1
joyous	1
love.	1
Natasha's	1
thin	1
pale	1
face,	1
with	1
its	1
swollen	1
lips,	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
plain--it	1
was	1
dreadful.	1
But	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
that,	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
shining	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
beautiful.	1
They	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
behind	1
them.	1
	1
Peter	1
the	1
valet,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
wide	1
awake,	1
had	1
roused	1
the	1
doctor.	1
Timokhin,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
slept	1
at	1
all	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
leg,	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
watching	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
carefully	1
covering	1
his	1
bare	1
body	1
with	1
the	1
sheet	1
as	1
he	1
huddled	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
bench.	1
	1
"What's	1
this?"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
bed.	1
"Please	1
go	1
away,	1
madam!"	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
maid	1
sent	1
by	1
the	1
countess,	1
who	1
had	1
noticed	1
her	1
daughter's	1
absence,	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Like	1
a	1
somnambulist	1
aroused	1
from	1
her	1
sleep	1
Natasha	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and,	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
hut,	1
fell	1
sobbing	1
on	1
her	1
bed.	1
	1
From	1
that	1
time,	1
during	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
journey,	1
at	1
every	1
halting	1
place	1
and	1
wherever	1
they	1
spent	1
a	1
night,	1
Natasha	1
never	1
left	1
the	1
wounded	1
Bolkonski,	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
from	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
either	1
such	1
firmness	1
or	1
such	1
skill	1
in	1
nursing	1
a	1
wounded	1
man.	1
	1
Dreadful	1
as	1
the	1
countess	1
imagined	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
should	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
die	1
in	1
her	1
daughter's	1
arms	1
during	1
the	1
journey--as,	1
judging	1
by	1
what	1
the	1
doctor	1
said,	1
it	1
seemed	1
might	1
easily	1
happen--she	1
could	1
not	1
oppose	1
Natasha.	1
Though	1
with	1
the	1
intimacy	1
now	1
established	1
between	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
and	1
Natasha	1
the	1
thought	1
occurred	1
that	1
should	1
he	1
recover	1
their	1
former	1
engagement	1
would	1
be	1
renewed,	1
no	1
one--least	1
of	1
all	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew--spoke	1
of	1
this:	1
the	1
unsettled	1
question	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death,	1
which	1
hung	1
not	1
only	1
over	1
Bolkonski	1
but	1
over	1
all	1
Russia,	1
shut	1
out	1
all	1
other	1
considerations.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXIII	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
of	1
September	1
Pierre	1
awoke	1
late.	1
His	1
head	1
was	1
aching,	1
the	1
clothes	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
slept	1
without	1
undressing	1
felt	1
uncomfortable	1
on	1
his	1
body,	1
and	1
his	1
mind	1
had	1
a	1
dim	1
consciousness	1
of	1
something	1
shameful	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
That	1
something	1
shameful	1
was	1
his	1
yesterday's	1
conversation	1
with	1
Captain	1
Ramballe.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
eleven	1
by	1
the	1
clock,	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
peculiarly	1
dark	1
out	1
of	1
doors.	1
Pierre	1
rose,	1
rubbed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
pistol	1
with	1
an	1
engraved	1
stock	1
which	1
Gerasim	1
had	1
replaced	1
on	1
the	1
writing	1
table,	1
he	1
remembered	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
very	1
day.	1
	1
"Am	1
I	1
not	1
too	1
late?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"No,	1
probably	1
he	1
won't	1
make	1
his	1
entry	1
into	1
Moscow	1
before	1
noon."	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
hastened	1
to	1
act.	1
	1
After	1
arranging	1
his	1
clothes,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
pistol	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
out.	1
But	1
it	1
then	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
certainly	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
the	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
through	1
the	1
streets.	1
It	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
hide	1
such	1
a	1
big	1
pistol	1
even	1
under	1
his	1
wide	1
coat.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
it	1
unnoticed	1
in	1
his	1
belt	1
or	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
discharged,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
reload	1
it.	1
"No	1
matter,	1
dagger	1
will	1
do,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
though	1
when	1
planning	1
his	1
design	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
mistake	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
student	1
in	1
1809	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
kill	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
a	1
dagger.	1
But	1
as	1
his	1
chief	1
aim	1
consisted	1
not	1
in	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
design,	1
but	1
in	1
proving	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
abandon	1
his	1
intention	1
and	1
was	1
doing	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
achieve	1
it,	1
Pierre	1
hastily	1
took	1
the	1
blunt	1
jagged	1
dagger	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
sheath	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
at	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
market	1
with	1
the	1
pistol,	1
and	1
hid	1
it	1
under	1
his	1
waistcoat.	1
	1
Having	1
tied	1
a	1
girdle	1
over	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
pulled	1
his	1
cap	1
low	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
Pierre	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
corridor,	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
making	1
a	1
noise	1
or	1
meeting	1
the	1
captain,	1
and	1
passed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
The	1
conflagration,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
indifference	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
had	1
greatly	1
increased	1
during	1
the	1
night.	1
Moscow	1
was	1
on	1
fire	1
in	1
several	1
places.	1
The	1
buildings	1
in	1
Carriage	1
Row,	1
across	1
the	1
river,	1
in	1
the	1
Bazaar	1
and	1
the	1
Povarskoy,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
barges	1
on	1
the	1
Moskva	1
River	1
and	1
the	1
timber	1
yards	1
by	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
Bridge,	1
were	1
all	1
ablaze.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
way	1
led	1
through	1
side	1
streets	1
to	1
the	1
Povarskoy	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
St.	1
Nicholas	1
on	1
the	1
Arbat,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
before	1
decided	1
that	1
the	1
deed	1
should	1
be	1
done.	1
The	1
gates	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
were	1
locked	1
and	1
the	1
shutters	1
up.	1
The	1
streets	1
and	1
lanes	1
were	1
deserted.	1
The	1
air	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
smoke	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
burning.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
met	1
Russians	1
with	1
anxious	1
and	1
timid	1
faces,	1
and	1
Frenchmen	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
Both	1
the	1
Russians	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
surprise.	1
Besides	1
his	1
height	1
and	1
stoutness,	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
morose	1
look	1
of	1
suffering	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
whole	1
figure,	1
the	1
Russians	1
stared	1
at	1
Pierre	1
because	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
to	1
what	1
class	1
he	1
could	1
belong.	1
The	1
French	1
followed	1
him	1
with	1
astonishment	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
chiefly	1
because	1
Pierre,	1
unlike	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
Russians	1
who	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
curiosity,	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
them.	1
At	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
one	1
house	1
three	1
Frenchmen,	1
who	1
were	1
explaining	1
something	1
to	1
some	1
Russians	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
them,	1
stopped	1
Pierre	1
asking	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
French.	1
	1
Pierre	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
went	1
on.	1
In	1
another	1
side	1
street	1
a	1
sentinel	1
standing	1
beside	1
a	1
green	1
caisson	1
shouted	1
at	1
him,	1
but	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
shout	1
was	1
threateningly	1
repeated	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
click	1
of	1
the	1
man's	1
musket	1
as	1
he	1
raised	1
it	1
did	1
Pierre	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
street.	1
He	1
heard	1
nothing	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
around	1
him.	1
He	1
carried	1
his	1
resolution	1
within	1
himself	1
in	1
terror	1
and	1
haste,	1
like	1
something	1
dreadful	1
and	1
alien	1
to	1
him,	1
for,	1
after	1
the	1
previous	1
night's	1
experience,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
losing	1
it.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
destined	1
to	1
bring	1
his	1
mood	1
safely	1
to	1
his	1
destination.	1
And	1
even	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
hindered	1
by	1
anything	1
on	1
the	1
way,	1
his	1
intention	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
have	1
been	1
carried	1
out,	1
for	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
Arbat	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
hours	1
previously	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
suburb	1
to	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
gloomy	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
a	1
royal	1
study	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
giving	1
detailed	1
and	1
exact	1
orders	1
as	1
to	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
immediately	1
to	1
extinguish	1
the	1
fire,	1
to	1
prevent	1
looting,	1
and	1
to	1
reassure	1
the	1
inhabitants.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
this;	1
he	1
was	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
tortured--as	1
those	1
are	1
who	1
obstinately	1
undertake	1
a	1
task	1
that	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
difficulty	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
incompatibility	1
with	1
their	1
natures--by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
weakening	1
at	1
the	1
decisive	1
moment	1
and	1
so	1
losing	1
his	1
self-esteem.	1
	1
Though	1
he	1
heard	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
around	1
him	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
way	1
by	1
instinct	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
wrong	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
streets	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
Povarskoy.	1
	1
As	1
Pierre	1
approached	1
that	1
street	1
the	1
smoke	1
became	1
denser	1
and	1
denser--he	1
even	1
felt	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
Occasionally	1
curly	1
tongues	1
of	1
flame	1
rose	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
houses.	1
He	1
met	1
more	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
excited.	1
But	1
Pierre,	1
though	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
unusual	1
was	1
happening	1
around	1
him,	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
fire.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
along	1
a	1
foot	1
path	1
across	1
a	1
wide-	1
open	1
space	1
adjoining	1
the	1
Povarskoy	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
gardens	1
of	1
Prince	1
Gruzinski's	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
the	1
desperate	1
weeping	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
close	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
stopped	1
as	1
if	1
awakening	1
from	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
lifted	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
path,	1
on	1
the	1
dusty	1
dry	1
grass,	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
household	1
goods	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
heap:	1
featherbeds,	1
a	1
samovar,	1
icons,	1
and	1
trunks.	1
On	1
the	1
ground,	1
beside	1
the	1
trunks,	1
sat	1
a	1
thin	1
woman	1
no	1
longer	1
young,	1
with	1
long,	1
prominent	1
upper	1
teeth,	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
black	1
cloak	1
and	1
cap.	1
This	1
woman,	1
swaying	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
and	1
muttering	1
something,	1
was	1
choking	1
with	1
sobs.	1
Two	1
girls	1
of	1
about	1
ten	1
and	1
twelve,	1
dressed	1
in	1
dirty	1
short	1
frocks	1
and	1
cloaks,	1
were	1
staring	1
at	1
their	1
mother	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
stupefaction	1
on	1
their	1
pale	1
frightened	1
faces.	1
The	1
youngest	1
child,	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
about	1
seven,	1
who	1
wore	1
an	1
overcoat	1
and	1
an	1
immense	1
cap	1
evidently	1
not	1
his	1
own,	1
was	1
crying	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
nurse's	1
arms.	1
A	1
dirty,	1
barefooted	1
maid	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
trunk,	1
and,	1
having	1
undone	1
her	1
pale-colored	1
plait,	1
was	1
pulling	1
it	1
straight	1
and	1
sniffing	1
at	1
her	1
singed	1
hair.	1
The	1
woman's	1
husband,	1
a	1
short,	1
round-	1
shouldered	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
undress	1
uniform	1
of	1
a	1
civilian	1
official,	1
with	1
sausage-shaped	1
whiskers	1
and	1
showing	1
under	1
his	1
square-set	1
cap	1
the	1
hair	1
smoothly	1
brushed	1
forward	1
over	1
his	1
temples,	1
with	1
expressionless	1
face	1
was	1
moving	1
the	1
trunks,	1
which	1
were	1
placed	1
one	1
on	1
another,	1
and	1
was	1
dragging	1
some	1
garments	1
from	1
under	1
them.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
Pierre,	1
the	1
woman	1
almost	1
threw	1
herself	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
"Dear	1
people,	1
good	1
Christians,	1
save	1
me,	1
help	1
me,	1
dear	1
friends...	1
help	1
us,	1
somebody,"	1
she	1
muttered	1
between	1
her	1
sobs.	1
"My	1
girl...	1
My	1
daughter!	1
My	1
youngest	1
daughter	1
is	1
left	1
behind.	1
She's	1
burned!	1
Ooh!	1
Was	1
it	1
for	1
this	1
I	1
nursed	1
you....	1
Ooh!"	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Mary	1
Nikolievna!"	1
said	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
evidently	1
only	1
to	1
justify	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
stranger.	1
"Sister	1
must	1
have	1
taken	1
her,	1
or	1
else	1
where	1
can	1
she	1
be?"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Monster!	1
Villain!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
woman	1
angrily,	1
suddenly	1
ceasing	1
to	1
weep.	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
heart,	1
you	1
don't	1
feel	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
child!	1
Another	1
man	1
would	1
have	1
rescued	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
fire.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
monster	1
and	1
neither	1
a	1
man	1
nor	1
a	1
father!	1
You,	1
honored	1
sir,	1
are	1
a	1
noble	1
man,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
addressing	1
Pierre	1
rapidly	1
between	1
her	1
sobs.	1
"The	1
fire	1
broke	1
out	1
alongside,	1
and	1
blew	1
our	1
way,	1
the	1
maid	1
called	1
out	1
'Fire!'	1
and	1
we	1
rushed	1
to	1
collect	1
our	1
things.	1
We	1
ran	1
out	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
were....	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
away....	1
The	1
icons,	1
and	1
my	1
dowry	1
bed,	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
is	1
lost.	1
We	1
seized	1
the	1
children.	1
But	1
not	1
Katie!	1
Ooh!	1
O	1
Lord!..."	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
sob.	1
"My	1
child,	1
my	1
dear	1
one!	1
Burned,	1
burned!"	1
	1
"But	1
where	1
was	1
she	1
left?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
animated	1
face	1
the	1
woman	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
might	1
help	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
dear	1
sir!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
legs.	1
"My	1
benefactor,	1
set	1
my	1
heart	1
at	1
ease....	1
Aniska,	1
go,	1
you	1
horrid	1
girl,	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
way!"	1
she	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
maid,	1
angrily	1
opening	1
her	1
mouth	1
and	1
still	1
farther	1
exposing	1
her	1
long	1
teeth.	1
	1
"Show	1
me	1
the	1
way,	1
show	1
me,	1
I...	1
I'll	1
do	1
it,"	1
gasped	1
Pierre	1
rapidly.	1
	1
The	1
dirty	1
maidservant	1
stepped	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
trunk,	1
put	1
up	1
her	1
plait,	1
sighed,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
her	1
short,	1
bare	1
feet	1
along	1
the	1
path.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
life	1
after	1
a	1
heavy	1
swoon.	1
He	1
held	1
his	1
head	1
higher,	1
his	1
eyes	1
shone	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
with	1
swift	1
steps	1
he	1
followed	1
the	1
maid,	1
overtook	1
her,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
Povarskoy.	1
The	1
whole	1
street	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
clouds	1
of	1
black	1
smoke.	1
Tongues	1
of	1
flame	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
broke	1
through	1
that	1
cloud.	1
A	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
people	1
crowded	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
conflagration.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
stood	1
a	1
French	1
general	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
those	1
around	1
him.	1
Pierre,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
maid,	1
was	1
advancing	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
general	1
stood,	1
but	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers	1
stopped	1
him.	1
	1
"On	1
ne	1
passe	1
pas!"	1
*	1
cried	1
a	1
voice.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"You	1
can't	1
pass!"	1
	1
"This	1
way,	1
uncle,"	1
cried	1
the	1
girl.	1
"We'll	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
side	1
street,	1
by	1
the	1
Nikulins'!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
back,	1
giving	1
a	1
spring	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
her.	1
She	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
street,	1
turned	1
down	1
a	1
side	1
street	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and,	1
passing	1
three	1
houses,	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
yard	1
on	1
the	1
right.	1
	1
"It's	1
here,	1
close	1
by,"	1
said	1
she	1
and,	1
running	1
across	1
the	1
yard,	1
opened	1
a	1
gate	1
in	1
a	1
wooden	1
fence	1
and,	1
stopping,	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
small	1
wooden	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
which	1
was	1
burning	1
brightly	1
and	1
fiercely.	1
One	1
of	1
its	1
sides	1
had	1
fallen	1
in,	1
another	1
was	1
on	1
fire,	1
and	1
bright	1
flames	1
issued	1
from	1
the	1
openings	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
and	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
roof.	1
	1
As	1
Pierre	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
fence	1
gate,	1
he	1
was	1
enveloped	1
by	1
hot	1
air	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Which	1
is	1
it?	1
Which	1
is	1
your	1
house?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Ooh!"	1
wailed	1
the	1
girl,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
wing.	1
"That's	1
it,	1
that	1
was	1
our	1
lodging.	1
You've	1
burned	1
to	1
death,	1
our	1
treasure,	1
Katie,	1
my	1
precious	1
little	1
missy!	1
Ooh!"	1
lamented	1
Aniska,	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
must	1
give	1
expression	1
to	1
her	1
feelings.	1
	1
Pierre	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
wing,	1
but	1
the	1
heat	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
passed	1
round	1
in	1
a	1
curve	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
large	1
house	1
that	1
was	1
as	1
yet	1
burning	1
only	1
at	1
one	1
end,	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
roof,	1
and	1
around	1
which	1
swarmed	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
Frenchmen.	1
At	1
first	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
what	1
these	1
men,	1
who	1
were	1
dragging	1
something	1
out,	1
were	1
about;	1
but	1
seeing	1
before	1
him	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
hitting	1
a	1
peasant	1
with	1
a	1
blunt	1
saber	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
fox-fur	1
coat,	1
he	1
vaguely	1
understood	1
that	1
looting	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
there,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
that	1
idea.	1
	1
The	1
sounds	1
of	1
crackling	1
and	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
falling	1
walls	1
and	1
ceilings,	1
the	1
whistle	1
and	1
hiss	1
of	1
the	1
flames,	1
the	1
excited	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
swaying	1
smoke,	1
now	1
gathering	1
into	1
thick	1
black	1
clouds	1
and	1
now	1
soaring	1
up	1
with	1
glittering	1
sparks,	1
with	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
dense	1
sheaves	1
of	1
flame	1
(now	1
red	1
and	1
now	1
like	1
golden	1
fish	1
scales	1
creeping	1
along	1
the	1
walls),	1
and	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
smoke	1
and	1
rapidity	1
of	1
motion,	1
produced	1
on	1
Pierre	1
the	1
usual	1
animating	1
effects	1
of	1
a	1
conflagration.	1
It	1
had	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
strong	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
because	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
suddenly	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
ideas	1
that	1
had	1
weighed	1
him	1
down.	1
He	1
felt	1
young,	1
bright,	1
adroit,	1
and	1
resolute.	1
He	1
ran	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lodge	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
dash	1
into	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
standing,	1
when	1
just	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
heard	1
several	1
voices	1
shouting	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
cracking	1
sound	1
and	1
the	1
ring	1
of	1
something	1
heavy	1
falling	1
close	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
saw	1
at	1
a	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
house	1
some	1
Frenchmen	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
thrown	1
out	1
the	1
drawer	1
of	1
a	1
chest,	1
filled	1
with	1
metal	1
articles.	1
Other	1
French	1
soldiers	1
standing	1
below	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
drawer.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
this	1
fellow	1
want?"	1
shouted	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
referring	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"There's	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
that	1
house.	1
Haven't	1
you	1
seen	1
a	1
child?"	1
cried	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"What's	1
he	1
talking	1
about?	1
Get	1
along!"	1
said	1
several	1
voices,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
evidently	1
afraid	1
that	1
Pierre	1
might	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
them	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
plate	1
and	1
bronzes	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
drawer,	1
moved	1
threateningly	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
"A	1
child?"	1
shouted	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
from	1
above.	1
"I	1
did	1
hear	1
something	1
squealing	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
Perhaps	1
it's	1
his	1
brat	1
that	1
the	1
fellow	1
is	1
looking	1
for.	1
After	1
all,	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
human,	1
you	1
know...."	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
it?	1
Where?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"There!	1
There!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit--I'm	1
coming	1
down."	1
	1
And	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
later	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
a	1
black-eyed	1
fellow	1
with	1
a	1
spot	1
on	1
his	1
cheek,	1
in	1
shirt	1
sleeves,	1
really	1
did	1
jump	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
window	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor,	1
and	1
clapping	1
Pierre	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
ran	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
garden.	1
	1
"Hurry	1
up,	1
you	1
others!"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
comrades.	1
"It's	1
getting	1
hot."	1
	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
gravel	1
path	1
behind	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
pulled	1
Pierre	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
round,	1
graveled	1
space	1
where	1
a	1
three-	1
year-old	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
pink	1
dress	1
was	1
lying	1
under	1
a	1
seat.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
your	1
child!	1
Oh,	1
a	1
girl,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better!"	1
said	1
the	1
Frenchman.	1
"Good-bye,	1
Fatty.	1
We	1
must	1
be	1
human,	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
mortal	1
you	1
know!"	1
and	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
the	1
spot	1
on	1
his	1
cheek	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
comrades.	1
	1
Breathless	1
with	1
joy,	1
Pierre	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
But	1
seeing	1
a	1
stranger	1
the	1
sickly,	1
scrofulous-looking	1
child,	1
unattractively	1
like	1
her	1
mother,	1
began	1
to	1
yell	1
and	1
run	1
away.	1
Pierre,	1
however,	1
seized	1
her	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
She	1
screamed	1
desperately	1
and	1
angrily	1
and	1
tried	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
hands	1
to	1
pull	1
Pierre's	1
hands	1
away	1
and	1
to	1
bite	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
slobbering	1
mouth.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
repulsion	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
when	1
touching	1
some	1
nasty	1
little	1
animal.	1
But	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
not	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
child	1
down	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
house.	1
It	1
was	1
now,	1
however,	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
had	1
come;	1
the	1
maid,	1
Aniska,	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
pity	1
and	1
disgust	1
pressed	1
the	1
wet,	1
painfully	1
sobbing	1
child	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
tenderly	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
garden	1
seeking	1
another	1
way	1
out.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXXIV	1
	1
Having	1
run	1
through	1
different	1
yards	1
and	1
side	1
streets,	1
Pierre	1
got	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
burden	1
to	1
the	1
Gruzinski	1
garden	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
Povarskoy.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
recognize	1
the	1
place	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
child,	1
so	1
crowded	1
was	1
it	1
now	1
with	1
people	1
and	1
goods	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
dragged	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
houses.	1
Besides	1
Russian	1
families	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
refuge	1
here	1
from	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
their	1
belongings,	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
French	1
soldiers	1
in	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
clothing.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
them.	1
He	1
hurried	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
that	1
civil	1
servant	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
daughter	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
save	1
someone	1
else.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
quickly.	1
Glowing	1
with	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
from	1
running,	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
more	1
strongly	1
than	1
ever	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
youth,	1
animation,	1
and	1
determination	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
child.	1
She	1
had	1
now	1
become	1
quiet	1
and,	1
clinging	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
hands	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
coat,	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
gazing	1
about	1
her	1
like	1
some	1
little	1
wild	1
animal.	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
occasionally	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile.	1
He	1
fancied	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
pathetically	1
innocent	1
in	1
that	1
frightened,	1
sickly	1
little	1
face.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
civil	1
servant	1
or	1
his	1
wife	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
them.	1
He	1
walked	1
among	1
the	1
crowd	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps,	1
scanning	1
the	1
various	1
faces	1
he	1
met.	1
Involuntarily	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
Georgian	1
or	1
Armenian	1
family	1
consisting	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
old	1
man	1
of	1
Oriental	1
type,	1
wearing	1
a	1
new,	1
cloth-	1
covered,	1
sheepskin	1
coat	1
and	1
new	1
boots,	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
of	1
similar	1
type,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
woman.	1
That	1
very	1
young	1
woman	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
Oriental	1
beauty,	1
with	1
her	1
sharply	1
outlined,	1
arched,	1
black	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
the	1
extraordinarily	1
soft,	1
bright	1
color	1
of	1
her	1
long,	1
beautiful,	1
expressionless	1
face.	1
Amid	1
the	1
scattered	1
property	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
on	1
the	1
open	1
space,	1
she,	1
in	1
her	1
rich	1
satin	1
cloak	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
lilac	1
shawl	1
on	1
her	1
head,	1
suggested	1
a	1
delicate	1
exotic	1
plant	1
thrown	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
snow.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
some	1
bundles	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
old	1
woman,	1
and	1
looked	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
long	1
lashes	1
with	1
motionless,	1
large,	1
almond-shaped	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
ground	1
before	1
her.	1
Evidently	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
fearful	1
because	1
of	1
it.	1
Her	1
face	1
struck	1
Pierre	1
and,	1
hurrying	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
fence,	1
he	1
turned	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
fence,	1
still	1
without	1
finding	1
those	1
he	1
sought,	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
With	1
the	1
child	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
his	1
figure	1
was	1
now	1
more	1
conspicuous	1
than	1
before,	1
and	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
Russians,	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
gathered	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
lost	1
anyone,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow?	1
You're	1
of	1
the	1
gentry	1
yourself,	1
aren't	1
you?	1
Whose	1
child	1
is	1
it?"	1
they	1
asked	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
coat	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
there	1
with	1
her	1
other	1
children,	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
anyone	1
knew	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
gone.	1
	1
"Why,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
Anferovs,"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
deacon,	1
addressing	1
a	1
pockmarked	1
peasant	1
woman.	1
"Lord	1
have	1
mercy,	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy!"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
his	1
customary	1
bass.	1
	1
"The	1
Anferovs?	1
No,"	1
said	1
the	1
woman.	1
"They	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
That	1
must	1
be	1
either	1
Mary	1
Nikolievna's	1
or	1
the	1
Ivanovs'!"	1
	1
"He	1
says	1
'a	1
woman,'	1
and	1
Mary	1
Nikolievna	1
is	1
a	1
lady,"	1
remarked	1
a	1
house	1
serf.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
her?	1
She's	1
thin,	1
with	1
long	1
teeth,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"That's	1
Mary	1
Nikolievna!	1
They	1
went	1
inside	1
the	1
garden	1
when	1
these	1
wolves	1
swooped	1
down,"	1
said	1
the	1
woman,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord,	1
have	1
mercy!"	1
added	1
the	1
deacon.	1
	1
"Go	1
over	1
that	1
way,	1
they're	1
there.	1
It's	1
she!	1
She	1
kept	1
on	1
lamenting	1
and	1
crying,"	1
continued	1
the	1
woman.	1
"It's	1
she.	1
Here,	1
this	1
way!"	1
	1
But	1
Pierre	1
was	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
woman.	1
He	1
had	1
for	1
some	1
seconds	1
been	1
intently	1
watching	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
away.	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Armenian	1
family	1
and	1
at	1
two	1
French	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
One	1
of	1
these,	1
a	1
nimble	1
little	1
man,	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
blue	1
coat	1
tied	1
round	1
the	1
waist	1
with	1
a	1
rope.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
nightcap	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
bare.	1
The	1
other,	1
whose	1
appearance	1
particularly	1
struck	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
lank,	1
round-shouldered,	1
fair-haired	1
man,	1
slow	1
in	1
his	1
movements	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
idiotic	1
expression	1
of	1
face.	1
He	1
wore	1
a	1
woman's	1
loose	1
gown	1
of	1
frieze,	1
blue	1
trousers,	1
and	1
large	1
torn	1
Hessian	1
boots.	1
The	1
little	1
barefooted	1
Frenchman	1
in	1
the	1
blue	1
coat	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Armenians	1
and,	1
saying	1
something,	1
immediately	1
seized	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
by	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
pulling	1
off	1
his	1
boots.	1
The	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
gown	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Armenian	1
girl	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets	1
stood	1
staring	1
at	1
her,	1
motionless	1
and	1
silent.	1
	1
"Here,	1
take	1
the	1
child!"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
peremptorily	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
handing	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
to	1
her.	1
"Give	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
them,	1
give	1
her	1
back!"	1
he	1
almost	1
shouted,	1
putting	1
the	1
child,	1
who	1
began	1
screaming,	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
again	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
the	1
Armenian	1
family.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
already	1
sitting	1
barefoot.	1
The	1
little	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
secured	1
his	1
second	1
boot	1
and	1
was	1
slapping	1
one	1
boot	1
against	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
broken	1
by	1
sobs,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
caught	1
but	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
this,	1
his	1
whole	1
attention	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
gown	1
who	1
meanwhile,	1
swaying	1
slowly	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
had	1
drawn	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
pockets	1
had	1
seized	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
neck.	1
	1
The	1
beautiful	1
Armenian	1
still	1
sat	1
motionless	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
attitude,	1
with	1
her	1
long	1
lashes	1
drooping	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
or	1
feel	1
what	1
the	1
soldier	1
was	1
doing	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
While	1
Pierre	1
was	1
running	1
the	1
few	1
steps	1
that	1
separated	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
the	1
tall	1
marauder	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
gown	1
was	1
already	1
tearing	1
from	1
her	1
neck	1
the	1
necklace	1
the	1
young	1
Armenian	1
was	1
wearing,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
woman,	1
clutching	1
at	1
her	1
neck,	1
screamed	1
piercingly.	1
	1
"Let	1
that	1
woman	1
alone!"	1
exclaimed	1
Pierre	1
hoarsely	1
in	1
a	1
furious	1
voice,	1
seizing	1
the	1
soldier	1
by	1
his	1
round	1
shoulders	1
and	1
throwing	1
him	1
aside.	1
	1
The	1
soldier	1
fell,	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
ran	1
away.	1
But	1
his	1
comrade,	1
throwing	1
down	1
the	1
boots	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword,	1
moved	1
threateningly	1
toward	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Voyons,	1
Pas	1
de	1
betises!"	1
*	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Look	1
here,	1
no	1
nonsense!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
transport	1
of	1
rage	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
nothing	1
and	1
his	1
strength	1
increased	1
tenfold.	1
He	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
barefooted	1
Frenchman	1
and,	1
before	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
draw	1
his	1
sword,	1
knocked	1
him	1
off	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
hammered	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
fists.	1
Shouts	1
of	1
approval	1
were	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
crowd	1
around,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
mounted	1
patrol	1
of	1
French	1
uhlans	1
appeared	1
from	1
round	1
the	1
corner.	1
The	1
uhlans	1
came	1
up	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
surrounded	1
them.	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
happened	1
after	1
that.	1
He	1
only	1
remembered	1
beating	1
someone	1
and	1
being	1
beaten	1
and	1
finally	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
bound	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
French	1
soldiers	1
stood	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
were	1
searching	1
him.	1
	1
"Lieutenant,	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
dagger,"	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
Pierre	1
understood.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
a	1
weapon?"	1
said	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
barefooted	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
arrested	1
with	1
Pierre.	1
"All	1
right,	1
you	1
can	1
tell	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
court-martial."	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"Do	1
you	1
speak	1
French?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
bloodshot	1
eyes	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
His	1
face	1
probably	1
looked	1
very	1
terrible,	1
for	1
the	1
officer	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
and	1
four	1
more	1
uhlans	1
left	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
placed	1
themselves	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
speak	1
French?"	1
the	1
officer	1
asked	1
again,	1
keeping	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
Pierre.	1
"Call	1
the	1
interpreter."	1
	1
A	1
little	1
man	1
in	1
Russian	1
civilian	1
clothes	1
rode	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
ranks,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
clothes	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking	1
Pierre	1
at	1
once	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
French	1
salesman	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
shops.	1
	1
"He	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
common	1
man,"	1
said	1
the	1
interpreter,	1
after	1
a	1
searching	1
look	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
he	1
looks	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
an	1
incendiary,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
officer.	1
"And	1
ask	1
him	1
who	1
he	1
is,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
asked	1
the	1
interpreter	1
in	1
poor	1
Russian.	1
"You	1
must	1
answer	1
the	1
chief."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
who	1
I	1
am.	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
prisoner--take	1
me!"	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
replied	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
ah!"	1
muttered	1
the	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
"Well	1
then,	1
march!"	1
	1
A	1
crowd	1
had	1
collected	1
round	1
the	1
uhlans.	1
Nearest	1
to	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
the	1
pockmarked	1
peasant	1
woman	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
patrol	1
started	1
she	1
moved	1
forward.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
they	1
taking	1
you	1
to,	1
you	1
poor	1
dear?"	1
said	1
she.	1
"And	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
if	1
she's	1
not	1
theirs?"	1
said	1
the	1
woman.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
that	1
woman	1
want?"	1
asked	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
intoxicated.	1
His	1
elation	1
increased	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
he	1
had	1
saved.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
she	1
want?"	1
he	1
murmured.	1
"She	1
is	1
bringing	1
me	1
my	1
daughter	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
saved	1
from	1
the	1
flames,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Good-bye!"	1
And	1
without	1
knowing	1
how	1
this	1
aimless	1
lie	1
had	1
escaped	1
him,	1
he	1
went	1
along	1
with	1
resolute	1
and	1
triumphant	1
steps	1
between	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
patrol	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
sent	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
various	1
streets	1
of	1
Moscow	1
by	1
Durosnel's	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
pillage,	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
incendiaries	1
who,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
opinion	1
which	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
originated	1
among	1
the	1
higher	1
French	1
officers,	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
conflagrations.	1
After	1
marching	1
through	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
streets	1
the	1
patrol	1
arrested	1
five	1
more	1
Russian	1
suspects:	1
a	1
small	1
shopkeeper,	1
two	1
seminary	1
students,	1
a	1
peasant,	1
and	1
a	1
house	1
serf,	1
besides	1
several	1
looters.	1
But	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
various	1
suspected	1
characters,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
considered	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
suspicious	1
of	1
all.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
brought	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Zubov	1
Rampart	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
guardhouse,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
placed	1
apart	1
under	1
strict	1
guard.	1

In	1

at	1

was	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
with	1
greater	1

way	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
hard,	1
except	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
effort,	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
danger	1
and	1
the	1
difficult	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people.	1
There	1
were	1
the	1
same	1
receptions	1
and	1
balls,	1
the	1
same	1
French	1
theater,	1
the	1
same	1
court	1
interests	1
and	1
service	1
interests	1
and	1
intrigues	1
as	1
usual.	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
highest	1
circles	1
were	1
attempts	1
made	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
mind	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
actual	1
position.	1
Stories	1
were	1
whispered	1
of	1
how	1
differently	1
the	1
two	1
Empresses	1
behaved	1
in	1
these	1
difficult	1
circumstances.	1
The	1
Empress	1
Marya,	1
concerned	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
charitable	1
and	1
educational	1
institutions	1
under	1
her	1
patronage,	1
had	1
given	1
directions	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
all	1
be	1
removed	1
to	1
Kazan,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
belonging	1
to	1
these	1
institutions	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
packed	1
up.	1
The	1
Empress	1
Elisabeth,	1
however,	1
when	1
asked	1
what	1
instructions	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
give--with	1
her	1
characteristic	1
Russian	1
patriotism	1
had	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
directions	1
about	1
state	1
institutions	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
personally	1
was	1
concerned	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
quit	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
At	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
of	1
August,	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
soiree,	1
the	1
chief	1
feature	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
His	1
Lordship	1
the	1
Bishop	1
when	1
sending	1
the	1
Emperor	1
an	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Venerable	1
Sergius.	1
It	1
was	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
ecclesiastical,	1
patriotic	1
eloquence.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
himself,	1
famed	1
for	1
his	1
elocution,	1
was	1
to	1
read	1
it.	1
(He	1
used	1
to	1
read	1
at	1
the	1
Empress'.)	1
The	1
art	1
of	1
his	1
reading	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
rolling	1
out	1
the	1
words,	1
quite	1
independently	1
of	1
their	1
meaning,	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
singsong	1
voice	1
alternating	1
between	1
a	1
despairing	1
wail	1
and	1
a	1
tender	1
murmur,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wail	1
fell	1
quite	1
at	1
random	1
on	1
one	1
word	1
and	1
the	1
murmur	1
on	1
another.	1
This	1
reading,	1
as	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
soirees,	1
had	1
a	1
political	1
significance.	1
That	1
evening	1
she	1
expected	1
several	1
important	1
personages	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
theater	1
and	1
aroused	1
to	1
a	1
patriotic	1
temper.	1
A	1
good	1
many	1
people	1
had	1
already	1
arrived,	1
but	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
not	1
yet	1
seeing	1
all	1
those	1
whom	1
she	1
wanted	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room,	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
reading	1
begin	1
but	1
wound	1
up	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
conversation.	1
	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
was	1
the	1
illness	1
of	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova.	1
She	1
had	1
fallen	1
ill	1
unexpectedly	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
previously,	1
had	1
missed	1
several	1
gatherings	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
usually	1
ornament,	1
and	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
receiving	1
no	1
one,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Petersburg	1
doctors	1
who	1
usually	1
attended	1
her	1
had	1
entrusted	1
herself	1
to	1
some	1
Italian	1
doctor	1
who	1
was	1
treating	1
her	1
in	1
some	1
new	1
and	1
unusual	1
way.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
the	1
enchanting	1
countess'	1
illness	1
arose	1
from	1
an	1
inconvenience	1
resulting	1
from	1
marrying	1
two	1
husbands	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Italian's	1
cure	1
consisted	1
in	1
removing	1
such	1
inconvenience;	1
but	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
presence	1
no	1
one	1
dared	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
or	1
even	1
appear	1
to	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
"They	1
say	1
the	1
poor	1
countess	1
is	1
very	1
ill.	1
The	1
doctor	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
angina	1
pectoris."	1
	1
"Angina?	1
Oh,	1
that's	1
a	1
terrible	1
illness!"	1
	1
"They	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
rivals	1
are	1
reconciled,	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
angina..."	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
angina	1
was	1
repeated	1
with	1
great	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
"The	1
count	1
is	1
pathetic,	1
they	1
say.	1
He	1
cried	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
the	1
doctor	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
dangerous."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
terrible	1
loss,	1
she	1
is	1
an	1
enchanting	1
woman."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
countess?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
coming	1
up	1
just	1
then.	1
"I	1
sent	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
news,	1
and	1
hear	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
better.	1
Oh,	1
she	1
is	1
certainly	1
the	1
most	1
charming	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
world,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
enthusiasm.	1
"We	1
belong	1
to	1
different	1
camps,	1
but	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
prevent	1
my	1
esteeming	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
deserves.	1
She	1
is	1
very	1
unfortunate!"	1
added	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
Supposing	1
that	1
by	1
these	1
words	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
was	1
somewhat	1
lifting	1
the	1
veil	1
from	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
malady,	1
an	1
unwary	1
young	1
man	1
ventured	1
to	1
express	1
surprise	1
that	1
well	1
known	1
doctors	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
called	1
in	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
being	1
attended	1
by	1
a	1
charlatan	1
who	1
might	1
employ	1
dangerous	1
remedies.	1
	1
"Your	1
information	1
may	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
mine,"	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
suddenly	1
and	1
venomously	1
retorted	1
on	1
the	1
inexperienced	1
young	1
man,	1
"but	1
I	1
know	1
on	1
good	1
authority	1
that	1
this	1
doctor	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
learned	1
and	1
able	1
man.	1
He	1
is	1
private	1
physician	1
to	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Spain."	1
	1
And	1
having	1
thus	1
demolished	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
turned	1
to	1
another	1
group	1
where	1
Bilibin	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
Austrians:	1
having	1
wrinkled	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
preparing	1
to	1
smooth	1
it	1
out	1
again	1
and	1
utter	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
mots.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
delightful,"	1
he	1
said,	1
referring	1
to	1
a	1
diplomatic	1
note	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
Vienna	1
with	1
some	1
Austrian	1
banners	1
captured	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
by	1
Wittgenstein,	1
"the	1
hero	1
of	1
Petropol"	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
called	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
"What?	1
What's	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
securing	1
silence	1
for	1
the	1
mot,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
before.	1
	1
And	1
Bilibin	1
repeated	1
the	1
actual	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
dispatch,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
composed.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
returns	1
these	1
Austrian	1
banners,"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
"friendly	1
banners	1
gone	1
astray	1
and	1
found	1
on	1
a	1
wrong	1
path,"	1
and	1
his	1
brow	1
became	1
smooth	1
again.	1
	1
"Charming,	1
charming!"	1
observed	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"The	1
path	1
to	1
Warsaw,	1
perhaps,"	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
remarked	1
loudly	1
and	1
unexpectedly.	1
Everybody	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
understanding	1
what	1
he	1
meant.	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
himself	1
glanced	1
around	1
with	1
amused	1
surprise.	1
He	1
knew	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
what	1
his	1
words	1
meant.	1
During	1
his	1
diplomatic	1
career	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
noticed	1
that	1
such	1
utterances	1
were	1
received	1
as	1
very	1
witty,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
opportunity	1
he	1
uttered	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
that	1
entered	1
his	1
head.	1
"It	1
may	1
turn	1
out	1
very	1
well,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"but	1
if	1
not,	1
they'll	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
matters."	1
And	1
really,	1
during	1
the	1
awkward	1
silence	1
that	1
ensued,	1
that	1
insufficiently	1
patriotic	1
person	1
entered	1
whom	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
convert,	1
and	1
she,	1
smiling	1
and	1
shaking	1
a	1
finger	1
at	1
Hippolyte,	1
invited	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
bringing	1
him	1
two	1
candles	1
and	1
the	1
manuscript	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
begin.	1
Everyone	1
became	1
silent.	1
	1
"Most	1
Gracious	1
Sovereign	1
and	1
Emperor!"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sternly	1
declaimed,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
audience	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
anyone	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
contrary.	1
But	1
no	1
one	1
said	1
anything.	1
"Moscow,	1
our	1
ancient	1
capital,	1
the	1
New	1
Jerusalem,	1
receives	1
her	1
Christ"--he	1
placed	1
a	1
sudden	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
her--"as	1
a	1
mother	1
receives	1
her	1
zealous	1
sons	1
into	1
her	1
arms,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
gathering	1
mists,	1
foreseeing	1
the	1
brilliant	1
glory	1
of	1
thy	1
rule,	1
sings	1
in	1
exultation,	1
'Hosanna,	1
blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh!'"	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
pronounced	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
in	1
a	1
tearful	1
voice.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
attentively	1
examined	1
his	1
nails,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
appeared	1
intimidated,	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
blame.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
whispered	1
the	1
next	1
words	1
in	1
advance,	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
muttering	1
the	1
prayer	1
at	1
Communion:	1
"Let	1
the	1
bold	1
and	1
insolent	1
Goliath..."	1
she	1
whispered.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
continued.	1
	1
"Let	1
the	1
bold	1
and	1
insolent	1
Goliath	1
from	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
France	1
encompass	1
the	1
realms	1
of	1
Russia	1
with	1
death-bearing	1
terrors;	1
humble	1
Faith,	1
the	1
sling	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
David,	1
shall	1
suddenly	1
smite	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
bloodthirsty	1
pride.	1
This	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Venerable	1
Sergius,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
zealous	1
champion	1
of	1
old	1
of	1
our	1
country's	1
weal,	1
is	1
offered	1
to	1
Your	1
Imperial	1
Majesty.	1
I	1
grieve	1
that	1
my	1
waning	1
strength	1
prevents	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
your	1
most	1
gracious	1
presence.	1
I	1
raise	1
fervent	1
prayers	1
to	1
Heaven	1
that	1
the	1
Almighty	1
may	1
exalt	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
the	1
just,	1
and	1
mercifully	1
fulfill	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
Your	1
Majesty."	1
	1
"What	1
force!	1
What	1
a	1
style!"	1
was	1
uttered	1
in	1
approval	1
both	1
of	1
reader	1
and	1
of	1
author.	1
	1
Animated	1
by	1
that	1
address	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
guests	1
talked	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
fatherland	1
and	1
offered	1
various	1
conjectures	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
to	1
be	1
fought	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
see,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"that	1
tomorrow,	1
on	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
birthday,	1
we	1
shall	1
receive	1
news.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
favorable	1
presentiment!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
presentiment	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
fulfilled.	1
Next	1
day	1
during	1
the	1
service	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
church	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
birthday,	1
Prince	1
Volkonski	1
was	1
called	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
received	1
a	1
dispatch	1
from	1
Prince	1
Kutuzov.	1
It	1
was	1
Kutuzov's	1
report,	1
written	1
from	1
Tatarinova	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
Kutuzov	1
wrote	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
not	1
retreated	1
a	1
step,	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
losses	1
were	1
much	1
heavier	1
than	1
ours,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
writing	1
in	1
haste	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
before	1
collecting	1
full	1
information.	1
It	1
followed	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
victory.	1
And	1
at	1
once,	1
without	1
leaving	1
the	1
church,	1
thanks	1
were	1
rendered	1
to	1
the	1
Creator	1
for	1
His	1
help	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
victory.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
presentiment	1
was	1
justified,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
morning	1
a	1
joyously	1
festive	1
mood	1
reigned	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
Everyone	1
believed	1
the	1
victory	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
complete,	1
and	1
some	1
even	1
spoke	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
having	1
been	1
captured,	1
of	1
his	1
deposition,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
ruler	1
for	1
France.	1
	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
for	1
events	1
to	1
be	1
reflected	1
in	1
their	1
real	1
strength	1
and	1
completeness	1
amid	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
court	1
life	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action.	1
General	1
events	1
involuntarily	1
group	1
themselves	1
around	1
some	1
particular	1
incident.	1
So	1
now	1
the	1
courtiers'	1
pleasure	1
was	1
based	1
as	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
news	1
had	1
arrived	1
on	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
birthday	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
victory	1
itself.	1
It	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
successfully	1
arranged	1
surprise.	1
Mention	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
Kutuzov's	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
losses,	1
among	1
which	1
figured	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Tuchkov,	1
Bagration,	1
and	1
Kutaysov.	1
In	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
world	1
this	1
sad	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
again	1
involuntarily	1
centered	1
round	1
a	1
single	1
incident:	1
Kutaysov's	1
death.	1
Everybody	1
knew	1
him,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
liked	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
young	1
and	1
interesting.	1
That	1
day	1
everyone	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
wonderful	1
coincidence!	1
Just	1
during	1
the	1
service.	1
But	1
what	1
a	1
loss	1
Kutaysov	1
is!	1
How	1
sorry	1
I	1
am!"	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
about	1
Kutuzov?"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
now	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
prophet's	1
pride.	1
"I	1
always	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
capable	1
of	1
defeating	1
Napoleon."	1
	1
But	1
next	1
day	1
no	1
news	1
arrived	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
mood	1
grew	1
anxious.	1
The	1
courtiers	1
suffered	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
suffering	1
the	1
suspense	1
occasioned	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"Fancy	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
position!"	1
said	1
they,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
extolling	1
Kutuzov	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
they	1
condemned	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
anxiety.	1
That	1
day	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
no	1
longer	1
boasted	1
of	1
his	1
protege	1
Kutuzov,	1
but	1
remained	1
silent	1
when	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was	1
mentioned.	1
Moreover,	1
toward	1
evening,	1
as	1
if	1
everything	1
conspired	1
to	1
make	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
anxious	1
and	1
uneasy,	1
a	1
terrible	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
was	1
added.	1
Countess	1
Helene	1
Bezukhova	1
had	1
suddenly	1
died	1
of	1
that	1
terrible	1
malady	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
agreeable	1
to	1
mention.	1
Officially,	1
at	1
large	1
gatherings,	1
everyone	1
said	1
that	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
had	1
died	1
of	1
a	1
terrible	1
attack	1
of	1
angina	1
pectoris,	1
but	1
in	1
intimate	1
circles	1
details	1
were	1
mentioned	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
private	1
physician	1
of	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Spain	1
had	1
prescribed	1
small	1
doses	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
drug	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
certain	1
effect;	1
but	1
Helene,	1
tortured	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
suspected	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
(that	1
wretched,	1
profligate	1
Pierre)	1
had	1
not	1
replied,	1
had	1
suddenly	1
taken	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
dose	1
of	1
the	1
drug,	1
and	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
agony	1
before	1
assistance	1
could	1
be	1
rendered	1
her.	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
had	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
Italian,	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
produced	1
such	1
letters	1
from	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
deceased	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
immediately	1
let	1
the	1
matter	1
drop.	1
	1
Talk	1
in	1
general	1
centered	1
round	1
three	1
melancholy	1
facts:	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
lack	1
of	1
news,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Kutaysov,	1
and	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Helene.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
Kutuzov's	1
report	1
a	1
country	1
gentleman	1
arrived	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
surrender	1
of	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
town.	1
This	1
was	1
terrible!	1
What	1
a	1
position	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
be	1
in!	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
a	1
traitor,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
during	1
the	1
visits	1
of	1
condolence	1
paid	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
his	1
daughter's	1
death	1
said	1
of	1
Kutuzov,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
praised	1
(it	1
was	1
excusable	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
grief	1
to	1
forget	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said),	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
expect	1
anything	1
else	1
from	1
a	1
blind	1
and	1
depraved	1
old	1
man.	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
wonder	1
that	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
Russia	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
entrusted	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man."	1
	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
this	1
news	1
remained	1
unofficial	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
doubt	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
following	1
communication	1
was	1
received	1
from	1
Count	1
Rostopchin:	1
	1
Prince	1
Kutuzov's	1
adjutant	1
has	1
brought	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
demands	1
police	1
officers	1
to	1
guide	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road.	1
He	1
writes	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
regretfully	1
abandoning	1
Moscow.	1
Sire!	1
Kutuzov's	1
action	1
decides	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
capital	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
empire!	1
Russia	1
will	1
shudder	1
to	1
learn	1
of	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
greatness	1
is	1
centered	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
lie	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
your	1
ancestors!	1
I	1
shall	1
follow	1
the	1
army.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
everything	1
removed,	1
and	1
it	1
only	1
remains	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
weep	1
over	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
my	1
fatherland.	1
	1
On	1
receiving	1
this	1
dispatch	1
the	1
Emperor	1
sent	1
Prince	1
Volkonski	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
the	1
following	1
rescript:	1
	1
Prince	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich!	1
Since	1
the	1
twenty-ninth	1
of	1
August	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
no	1
communication	1
from	1
you,	1
yet	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September	1
I	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
via	1
Yaroslavl,	1
the	1
sad	1
news	1
that	1
you,	1
with	1
the	1
army,	1
have	1
decided	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow.	1
You	1
can	1
yourself	1
imagine	1
the	1
effect	1
this	1
news	1
has	1
had	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
your	1
silence	1
increases	1
my	1
astonishment.	1
I	1
am	1
sending	1
this	1
by	1
Adjutant-General	1
Prince	1
Volkonski,	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
you	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
reasons	1
that	1
have	1
induced	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
this	1
melancholy	1
decision.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Nine	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
a	1
messenger	1
from	1
Kutuzov	1
reached	1
Petersburg	1
with	1
the	1
official	1
announcement	1
of	1
that	1
event.	1
This	1
messenger	1
was	1
Michaud,	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
Russian,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
quoique	1
etranger,	1
russe	1
de	1
coeur	1
et	1
d'ame,	1
*	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Though	1
a	1
foreigner,	1
Russian	1
in	1
heart	1
and	1
soul.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
at	1
once	1
received	1
this	1
messenger	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
on	1
Stone	1
Island.	1
Michaud,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
Moscow	1
before	1
the	1
campaign	1
and	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
Russian,	1
yet	1
felt	1
deeply	1
moved	1
(as	1
he	1
wrote)	1
when	1
he	1
appeared	1
before	1
notre	1
tres	1
gracieux	1
souverain	1
*	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
dont	1
les	1
flammes	1
eclairaient	1
sa	1
route.	1
*(2)	1
	1
	1
*	1
Our	1
most	1
gracious	1
sovereign.	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
Whose	1
flames	1
illumined	1
his	1
route.	1
	1
Though	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
M.	1
Michaud's	1
chagrin	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
caused	1
Russians	1
to	1
grieve,	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
sad	1
face	1
when	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
study	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
at	1
once	1
asked:	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
brought	1
me	1
sad	1
news,	1
Colonel?"	1
	1
"Very	1
sad,	1
sire,"	1
replied	1
Michaud,	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"The	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow."	1
	1
"Have	1
they	1
surrendered	1
my	1
ancient	1
capital	1
without	1
a	1
battle?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Emperor	1
quickly,	1
his	1
face	1
suddenly	1
flushing.	1
	1
Michaud	1
respectfully	1
delivered	1
the	1
message	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
impossible	1
to	1
fight	1
before	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
remaining	1
choice	1
was	1
between	1
losing	1
the	1
army	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
losing	1
Moscow	1
alone,	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
had	1
to	1
choose	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
listened	1
in	1
silence,	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
Michaud.	1
	1
"Has	1
the	1
enemy	1
entered	1
the	1
city?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sire,	1
and	1
Moscow	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
ashes.	1
I	1
left	1
it	1
all	1
in	1
flames,"	1
replied	1
Michaud	1
in	1
a	1
decided	1
tone,	1
but	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor	1
he	1
was	1
frightened	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
began	1
to	1
breathe	1
heavily	1
and	1
rapidly,	1
his	1
lower	1
lip	1
trembled,	1
and	1
tears	1
instantly	1
appeared	1
in	1
his	1
fine	1
blue	1
eyes.	1
	1
But	1
this	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
moment.	1
He	1
suddenly	1
frowned,	1
as	1
if	1
blaming	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
weakness,	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
head	1
addressed	1
Michaud	1
in	1
a	1
firm	1
voice:	1
	1
"I	1
see,	1
Colonel,	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
happening,	1
that	1
Providence	1
requires	1
great	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
us...	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
submit	1
myself	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
His	1
will;	1
but	1
tell	1
me,	1
Michaud,	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
leave	1
the	1
army	1
when	1
it	1
saw	1
my	1
ancient	1
capital	1
abandoned	1
without	1
a	1
battle?	1
Did	1
you	1
not	1
notice	1
discouragement?..."	1
	1
Seeing	1
that	1
his	1
most	1
gracious	1
ruler	1
was	1
calm	1
once	1
more,	1
Michaud	1
also	1
grew	1
calm,	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
immediately	1
ready	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
direct	1
and	1
relevant	1
question	1
which	1
required	1
a	1
direct	1
answer.	1
	1
"Sire,	1
will	1
you	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
frankly	1
as	1
befits	1
a	1
loyal	1
soldier?"	1
he	1
asked	1
to	1
gain	1
time.	1
	1
"Colonel,	1
I	1
always	1
require	1
it,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
"Conceal	1
nothing	1
from	1
me,	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
absolutely	1
how	1
things	1
are."	1
	1
"Sire!"	1
said	1
Michaud	1
with	1
a	1
subtle,	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips,	1
having	1
now	1
prepared	1
a	1
well-phrased	1
reply,	1
"sire,	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
from	1
its	1
chiefs	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
soldier,	1
without	1
exception	1
in	1
desperate	1
and	1
agonized	1
terror..."	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
that?"	1
the	1
Emperor	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
frowning	1
sternly.	1
"Would	1
misfortune	1
make	1
my	1
Russians	1
lose	1
heart?...	1
Never!"	1
	1
Michaud	1
had	1
only	1
waited	1
for	1
this	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
phrase	1
he	1
had	1
prepared.	1
	1
"Sire,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
respectful	1
playfulness,	1
"they	1
are	1
only	1
afraid	1
lest	1
Your	1
Majesty,	1
in	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
should	1
allow	1
yourself	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
to	1
make	1
peace.	1
They	1
are	1
burning	1
for	1
the	1
combat,"	1
declared	1
this	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
nation,	1
"and	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
by	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
how	1
devoted	1
they	1
are...."	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor	1
reassured,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
kindly	1
gleam	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
patted	1
Michaud	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
"You	1
set	1
me	1
at	1
ease,	1
Colonel."	1
	1
He	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
army,"	1
he	1
said,	1
drawing	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
full	1
height	1
and	1
addressing	1
Michaud	1
with	1
a	1
gracious	1
and	1
majestic	1
gesture,	1
"and	1
tell	1
our	1
brave	1
men	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
good	1
subjects	1
wherever	1
you	1
go	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
soldier	1
left	1
I	1
shall	1
put	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
nobility	1
and	1
my	1
good	1
peasants	1
and	1
so	1
use	1
the	1
last	1
resources	1
of	1
my	1
empire.	1
It	1
still	1
offers	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
my	1
enemies	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated;	1
"but	1
should	1
it	1
ever	1
be	1
ordained	1
by	1
Divine	1
Providence,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
raising	1
to	1
heaven	1
his	1
fine	1
eyes	1
shining	1
with	1
emotion,	1
"that	1
my	1
dynasty	1
should	1
cease	1
to	1
reign	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
my	1
ancestors,	1
then	1
after	1
exhausting	1
all	1
the	1
means	1
at	1
my	1
command,	1
I	1
shall	1
let	1
my	1
beard	1
grow	1
to	1
here"	1
(he	1
pointed	1
halfway	1
down	1
his	1
chest)	1
"and	1
go	1
and	1
eat	1
potatoes	1
with	1
the	1
meanest	1
of	1
my	1
peasants,	1
rather	1
than	1
sign	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
my	1
country	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
people	1
whose	1
sacrifices	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
appreciate."	1
	1
Having	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
an	1
agitated	1
voice	1
the	1
Emperor	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
away	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
hide	1
from	1
Michaud	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
further	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
study.	1
Having	1
stood	1
there	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
he	1
strode	1
back	1
to	1
Michaud	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
arm	1
below	1
the	1
elbow	1
with	1
a	1
vigorous	1
movement.	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
mild	1
and	1
handsome	1
face	1
was	1
flushed	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
with	1
resolution	1
and	1
anger.	1
	1
"Colonel	1
Michaud,	1
do	1
not	1
forget	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
here,	1
perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
recall	1
it	1
with	1
pleasure	1
someday...	1
Napoleon	1
or	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
touching	1
his	1
breast.	1
"We	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
both	1
reign	1
together.	1
I	1
have	1
learned	1
to	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
deceive	1
me	1
any	1
more...."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
Emperor	1
paused,	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
firm	1
resolution	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes,	1
Michaud--quoique	1
etranger,	1
russe	1
de	1
coeur	1
et	1
d'ame--	1
at	1
that	1
solemn	1
moment	1
felt	1
himself	1
enraptured	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
(as	1
he	1
used	1
afterwards	1
to	1
say),	1
and	1
gave	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
feelings	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
whose	1
representative	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
to	1
be,	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
words:	1
	1
"Sire!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
is	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
signing	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
Europe!"	1
	1
With	1
an	1
inclination	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
the	1
Emperor	1
dismissed	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
for	1
us	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
living	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
when	1
half	1
Russia	1
had	1
been	1
conquered	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
were	1
fleeing	1
to	1
distant	1
provinces,	1
and	1
one	1
levy	1
after	1
another	1
was	1
being	1
raised	1
for	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
fatherland,	1
all	1
Russians	1
from	1
the	1
greatest	1
to	1
the	1
least	1
were	1
solely	1
engaged	1
in	1
sacrificing	1
themselves,	1
saving	1
their	1
fatherland,	1
or	1
weeping	1
over	1
its	1
downfall.	1
The	1
tales	1
and	1
descriptions	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
without	1
exception	1
speak	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
self-sacrifice,	1
patriotic	1
devotion,	1
despair,	1
grief,	1
and	1
the	1
heroism	1
of	1
the	1
Russians.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
so.	1
It	1
appears	1
so	1
to	1
us	1
because	1
we	1
see	1
only	1
the	1
general	1
historic	1
interest	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
personal	1
human	1
interests	1
that	1
people	1
had.	1
Yet	1
in	1
reality	1
those	1
personal	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
so	1
much	1
transcend	1
the	1
general	1
interests	1
that	1
they	1
always	1
prevent	1
the	1
public	1
interest	1
from	1
being	1
felt	1
or	1
even	1
noticed.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
progress	1
of	1
events	1
but	1
were	1
guided	1
only	1
by	1
their	1
private	1
interests,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
people	1
whose	1
activities	1
at	1
that	1
period	1
were	1
most	1
useful.	1
	1
Those	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
it	1
by	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
heroism	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
useless	1
members	1
of	1
society,	1
they	1
saw	1
everything	1
upside	1
down,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
did	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
good	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
useless	1
and	1
foolish--like	1
Pierre's	1
and	1
Mamonov's	1
regiments	1
which	1
looted	1
Russian	1
villages,	1
and	1
the	1
lint	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
prepared	1
and	1
that	1
never	1
reached	1
the	1
wounded,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Even	1
those,	1
fond	1
of	1
intellectual	1
talk	1
and	1
of	1
expressing	1
their	1
feelings,	1
who	1
discussed	1
Russia's	1
position	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
involuntarily	1
introduced	1
into	1
their	1
conversation	1
either	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
pretense	1
and	1
falsehood	1
or	1
useless	1
condemnation	1
and	1
anger	1
directed	1
against	1
people	1
accused	1
of	1
actions	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
possibly	1
be	1
guilty	1
of.	1
In	1
historic	1
events	1
the	1
rule	1
forbidding	1
us	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Tree	1
of	1
Knowledge	1
is	1
specially	1
applicable.	1
Only	1
unconscious	1
action	1
bears	1
fruit,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
plays	1
a	1
part	1
in	1
an	1
historic	1
event	1
never	1
understands	1
its	1
significance.	1
If	1
he	1
tries	1
to	1
realize	1
it	1
his	1
efforts	1
are	1
fruitless.	1
	1
The	1
more	1
closely	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
events	1
then	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
Russia	1
the	1
less	1
did	1
he	1
realize	1
their	1
significance.	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
provinces	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
ladies,	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
militia	1
uniforms,	1
wept	1
for	1
Russia	1
and	1
its	1
ancient	1
capital	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
retired	1
beyond	1
Moscow	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
talk	1
or	1
thought	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
its	1
burned	1
ruins	1
no	1
one	1
swore	1
to	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
the	1
French,	1
but	1
they	1
thought	1
about	1
their	1
next	1
pay,	1
their	1
next	1
quarters,	1
of	1
Matreshka	1
the	1
vivandiere,	1
and	1
like	1
matters.	1
	1
As	1
the	1
war	1
had	1
caught	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
took	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
prolonged	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
his	1
country,	1
but	1
did	1
so	1
casually,	1
without	1
any	1
aim	1
at	1
self-sacrifice,	1
and	1
he	1
therefore	1
looked	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
Russia	1
without	1
despair	1
and	1
without	1
dismally	1
racking	1
his	1
brains	1
over	1
it.	1
Had	1
he	1
been	1
asked	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
Russia,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
business	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it,	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
there	1
for	1
that	1
purpose,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
regiments	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
full	1
strength,	1
that	1
fighting	1
would	1
probably	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
yet,	1
and	1
that	1
things	1
being	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
likely	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
regiment	1
in	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
years'	1
time.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
sent	1
to	1
Voronezh	1
to	1
buy	1
remounts	1
for	1
his	1
division,	1
not	1
only	1
without	1
regret	1
at	1
being	1
prevented	1
from	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
coming	1
battle,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure--which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
conceal	1
and	1
which	1
his	1
comrades	1
fully	1
understood.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
Nicholas	1
received	1
the	1
necessary	1
money	1
and	1
warrants,	1
and	1
having	1
sent	1
some	1
hussars	1
on	1
in	1
advance,	1
he	1
set	1
out	1
with	1
post	1
horses	1
for	1
Voronezh.	1
	1
Only	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
experienced	1
it--that	1
is,	1
has	1
passed	1
some	1
months	1
continuously	1
in	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
campaigning	1
and	1
war--can	1
understand	1
the	1
delight	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
when	1
he	1
escaped	1
from	1
the	1
region	1
covered	1
by	1
the	1
army's	1
foraging	1
operations,	1
provision	1
trains,	1
and	1
hospitals.	1
When--free	1
from	1
soldiers,	1
wagons,	1
and	1
the	1
filthy	1
traces	1
of	1
a	1
camp--he	1
saw	1
villages	1
with	1
peasants	1
and	1
peasant	1
women,	1
gentlemen's	1
country	1
houses,	1
fields	1
where	1
cattle	1
were	1
grazing,	1
posthouses	1
with	1
stationmasters	1
asleep	1
in	1
them,	1
he	1
rejoiced	1
as	1
though	1
seeing	1
all	1
this	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
What	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
specially	1
surprised	1
and	1
delighted	1
him	1
were	1
the	1
women,	1
young	1
and	1
healthy,	1
without	1
a	1
dozen	1
officers	1
making	1
up	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
them;	1
women,	1
too,	1
who	1
were	1
pleased	1
and	1
flattered	1
that	1
a	1
passing	1
officer	1
should	1
joke	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
highest	1
spirits	1
Nicholas	1
arrived	1
at	1
night	1
at	1
a	1
hotel	1
in	1
Voronezh,	1
ordered	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
deprived	1
of	1
in	1
camp,	1
and	1
next	1
day,	1
very	1
clean-shaven	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
full-dress	1
uniform	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
worn	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
went	1
to	1
present	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
authorities.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
was	1
a	1
civilian	1
general,	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
military	1
designation	1
and	1
rank.	1
He	1
received	1
Nicholas	1
brusquely	1
(imagining	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
characteristically	1
military)	1
and	1
questioned	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
important	1
air,	1
as	1
if	1
considering	1
the	1
general	1
progress	1
of	1
affairs	1
and	1
approving	1
and	1
disapproving	1
with	1
full	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
good	1
spirits	1
that	1
this	1
merely	1
amused	1
him.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
he	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
governor.	1
The	1
governor	1
was	1
a	1
brisk	1
little	1
man,	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
affable.	1
He	1
indicated	1
the	1
stud	1
farms	1
at	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
might	1
procure	1
horses,	1
recommended	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
horse	1
dealer	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
a	1
landowner	1
fourteen	1
miles	1
out	1
of	1
town	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
best	1
horses,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
in	1
every	1
way.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov's	1
son?	1
My	1
wife	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
your	1
mother's.	1
We	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
on	1
Thursdays--today	1
is	1
Thursday,	1
so	1
please	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
us	1
quite	1
informally,"	1
said	1
the	1
governor,	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
Immediately	1
on	1
leaving	1
the	1
governor's,	1
Nicholas	1
hired	1
post	1
horses	1
and,	1
taking	1
his	1
squadron	1
quartermaster	1
with	1
him,	1
drove	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
to	1
the	1
landowner,	1
fourteen	1
miles	1
away,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
stud.	1
Everything	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
pleasant	1
and	1
easy	1
during	1
that	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
and,	1
as	1
usually	1
happens	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
everything	1
went	1
well	1
and	1
easily.	1
	1
The	1
landowner	1
to	1
whom	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
was	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
an	1
old	1
cavalryman,	1
a	1
horse	1
fancier,	1
a	1
sportsman,	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
some	1
century-old	1
brandy	1
and	1
some	1
old	1
Hungarian	1
wine,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
snuggery	1
where	1
he	1
smoked,	1
and	1
who	1
owned	1
some	1
splendid	1
horses.	1
	1
In	1
very	1
few	1
words	1
Nicholas	1
bought	1
seventeen	1
picked	1
stallions	1
for	1
six	1
thousand	1
rubles--to	1
serve,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
samples	1
of	1
his	1
remounts.	1
After	1
dining	1
and	1
taking	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
Hungarian	1
wine,	1
Nicholas--	1
having	1
exchanged	1
kisses	1
with	1
the	1
landowner,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
friendliest	1
terms--galloped	1
back	1
over	1
abominable	1
roads,	1
in	1
the	1
brightest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind,	1
continually	1
urging	1
on	1
the	1
driver	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
governor's	1
party.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
changed,	1
poured	1
water	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
scented	1
himself,	1
Nicholas	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
governor's	1
rather	1
late,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
phrase	1
"better	1
late	1
than	1
never"	1
on	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
ball,	1
nor	1
had	1
dancing	1
been	1
announced,	1
but	1
everyone	1
knew	1
that	1
Catherine	1
Petrovna	1
would	1
play	1
valses	1
and	1
the	1
ecossaise	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
dancing,	1
and	1
so	1
everyone	1
had	1
come	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
ball.	1
	1
Provincial	1
life	1
in	1
1812	1
went	1
on	1
very	1
much	1
as	1
usual,	1
but	1
with	1
this	1
difference,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
livelier	1
in	1
the	1
towns	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
many	1
wealthy	1
families	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
everything	1
that	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
Russia	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
a	1
special	1
recklessness	1
was	1
noticeable,	1
an	1
"in	1
for	1
a	1
penny,	1
in	1
for	1
a	1
pound--who	1
cares?"	1
spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
inevitable	1
small	1
talk,	1
instead	1
of	1
turning	1
on	1
the	1
weather	1
and	1
mutual	1
acquaintances,	1
now	1
turned	1
on	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
The	1
society	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
governor's	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
in	1
Voronezh.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
ladies	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
Nicholas'	1
Moscow	1
acquaintances,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
men	1
who	1
could	1
at	1
all	1
vie	1
with	1
the	1
cavalier	1
of	1
St.	1
George,	1
the	1
hussar	1
remount	1
officer,	1
the	1
good-natured	1
and	1
well-bred	1
Count	1
Rostov.	1
Among	1
the	1
men	1
was	1
an	1
Italian	1
prisoner,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army;	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
that	1
prisoner	1
enhanced	1
his	1
own	1
importance	1
as	1
a	1
Russian	1
hero.	1
The	1
Italian	1
was,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
a	1
war	1
trophy.	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
this,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
everyone	1
regarded	1
the	1
Italian	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
light,	1
and	1
he	1
treated	1
him	1
cordially	1
though	1
with	1
dignity	1
and	1
restraint.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
entered	1
in	1
his	1
hussar	1
uniform,	1
diffusing	1
around	1
him	1
a	1
fragrance	1
of	1
perfume	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
had	1
uttered	1
the	1
words	1
"better	1
late	1
than	1
never"	1
and	1
heard	1
them	1
repeated	1
several	1
times	1
by	1
others,	1
people	1
clustered	1
around	1
him;	1
all	1
eyes	1
turned	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
proper	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
province--that	1
of	1
a	1
universal	1
favorite:	1
a	1
very	1
pleasant	1
position,	1
and	1
intoxicatingly	1
so	1
after	1
his	1
long	1
privations.	1
At	1
posting	1
stations,	1
at	1
inns,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
landowner's	1
snuggery,	1
maidservants	1
had	1
been	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
notice,	1
and	1
here	1
too	1
at	1
the	1
governor's	1
party	1
there	1
were	1
(as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Nicholas)	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
number	1
of	1
pretty	1
young	1
women,	1
married	1
and	1
unmarried,	1
impatiently	1
awaiting	1
his	1
notice.	1
The	1
women	1
and	1
girls	1
flirted	1
with	1
him	1
and,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day,	1
the	1
people	1
concerned	1
themselves	1
to	1
get	1
this	1
fine	1
young	1
daredevil	1
of	1
an	1
hussar	1
married	1
and	1
settled	1
down.	1
Among	1
these	1
was	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
herself,	1
who	1
welcomed	1
Rostov	1
as	1
a	1
near	1
relative	1
and	1
called	1
him	1
"Nicholas."	1
	1
Catherine	1
Petrovna	1
did	1
actually	1
play	1
valses	1
and	1
the	1
ecossaise,	1
and	1
dancing	1
began	1
in	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
still	1
further	1
captivated	1
the	1
provincial	1
society	1
by	1
his	1
agility.	1
His	1
particularly	1
free	1
manner	1
of	1
dancing	1
even	1
surprised	1
them	1
all.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
himself	1
rather	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
danced	1
that	1
evening.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
danced	1
like	1
that	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
would	1
even	1
have	1
considered	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
manner	1
improper	1
and	1
in	1
bad	1
form,	1
but	1
here	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
astonish	1
them	1
all	1
by	1
something	1
unusual,	1
something	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
accept	1
as	1
the	1
regular	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
capital	1
though	1
new	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
provinces.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
evening	1
Nicholas	1
paid	1
attention	1
to	1
a	1
blue-eyed,	1
plump	1
and	1
pleasing	1
little	1
blonde,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
provincial	1
officials.	1
With	1
the	1
naive	1
conviction	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
mood	1
that	1
other	1
men's	1
wives	1
were	1
created	1
for	1
them,	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
lady's	1
side	1
and	1
treated	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
and	1
conspiratorial	1
style,	1
as	1
if,	1
without	1
speaking	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
knew	1
how	1
capitally	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
would	1
get	1
on	1
together.	1
The	1
husband,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
share	1
that	1
conviction	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
behave	1
morosely	1
with	1
Rostov.	1
But	1
the	1
latter's	1
good-natured	1
naivete	1
was	1
so	1
boundless	1
that	1
sometimes	1
even	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
yielded	1
to	1
Nicholas'	1
good	1
humor.	1
Toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
evening,	1
however,	1
as	1
the	1
wife's	1
face	1
grew	1
more	1
flushed	1
and	1
animated,	1
the	1
husband's	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
melancholy	1
and	1
solemn,	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
a	1
given	1
amount	1
of	1
animation	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
wife's	1
share	1
increased	1
the	1
husband's	1
diminished.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
Nicholas	1
sat	1
leaning	1
slightly	1
forward	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
bending	1
closely	1
over	1
the	1
blonde	1
lady	1
and	1
paying	1
her	1
mythological	1
compliments	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
never	1
left	1
his	1
face.	1
Jauntily	1
shifting	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
their	1
tight	1
riding	1
breeches,	1
diffusing	1
an	1
odor	1
of	1
perfume,	1
and	1
admiring	1
his	1
partner,	1
himself,	1
and	1
the	1
fine	1
outlines	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
their	1
well-fitting	1
Hessian	1
boots,	1
Nicholas	1
told	1
the	1
blonde	1
lady	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
lady	1
here	1
in	1
Voronezh.	1
	1
"Which	1
lady?"	1
	1
"A	1
charming	1
lady,	1
a	1
divine	1
one.	1
Her	1
eyes"	1
(Nicholas	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
partner)	1
"are	1
blue,	1
her	1
mouth	1
coral	1
and	1
ivory;	1
her	1
figure"	1
(he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
shoulders)	1
"like	1
Diana's...."	1
	1
The	1
husband	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
sullenly	1
asked	1
his	1
wife	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
about.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Nikita	1
Ivanych!"	1
cried	1
Nicholas,	1
rising	1
politely,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
Nikita	1
Ivanych	1
to	1
share	1
his	1
joke,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
elope	1
with	1
a	1
blonde	1
lady.	1
	1
The	1
husband	1
smiled	1
gloomily,	1
the	1
wife	1
gaily.	1
The	1
governor's	1
good-natured	1
wife	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
disapproval.	1
	1
"Anna	1
Ignatyevna	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
Nicholas,"	1
said	1
she,	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
name	1
so	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
at	1
once	1
understood	1
that	1
Anna	1
Ignatyevna	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
person.	1
"Come,	1
Nicholas!	1
You	1
know	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
call	1
you	1
so?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
Aunt.	1
Who	1
is	1
she?"	1
	1
"Anna	1
Ignatyevna	1
Malvintseva.	1
She	1
has	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
niece	1
how	1
you	1
rescued	1
her...	1
Can	1
you	1
guess?"	1
	1
"I	1
rescued	1
such	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
them!"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Her	1
niece,	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya.	1
She	1
is	1
here	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
with	1
her	1
aunt.	1
Oho!	1
How	1
you	1
blush.	1
Why,	1
are...?"	1
	1
"Not	1
a	1
bit!	1
Please	1
don't,	1
Aunt!"	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
very	1
well!...	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
fellow	1
you	1
are!"	1
	1
The	1
governor's	1
wife	1
led	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
tall	1
and	1
very	1
stout	1
old	1
lady	1
with	1
a	1
blue	1
headdress,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
finished	1
her	1
game	1
of	1
cards	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
personages	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
This	1
was	1
Malvintseva,	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
aunt	1
on	1
her	1
mother's	1
side,	1
a	1
rich,	1
childless	1
widow	1
who	1
always	1
lived	1
in	1
Voronezh.	1
When	1
Rostov	1
approached	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
settling	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
game.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and,	1
screwing	1
up	1
her	1
eyes	1
sternly,	1
continued	1
to	1
upbraid	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
won	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
"Very	1
pleased,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
she	1
then	1
said,	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
"Pray	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
me."	1
	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
about	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
late	1
father,	1
whom	1
Malvintseva	1
had	1
evidently	1
not	1
liked,	1
and	1
having	1
asked	1
what	1
Nicholas	1
knew	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
also	1
was	1
evidently	1
no	1
favorite	1
of	1
hers,	1
the	1
important	1
old	1
lady	1
dismissed	1
Nicholas	1
after	1
repeating	1
her	1
invitation	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
blushed	1
again	1
as	1
he	1
bowed.	1
At	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
shyness	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
fear,	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
parted	1
from	1
Malvintseva	1
Nicholas	1
wished	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
dancing,	1
but	1
the	1
governor's	1
little	1
wife	1
placed	1
her	1
plump	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
sleeve	1
and,	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
him,	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
sitting	1
room,	1
from	1
which	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
there	1
immediately	1
withdrew	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
way.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
began	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
with	1
a	1
serious	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
kind	1
little	1
face,	1
"that	1
really	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
match	1
for	1
you:	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
me	1
to	1
arrange	1
it?"	1
	1
"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
Aunt?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
princess.	1
Catherine	1
Petrovna	1
speaks	1
of	1
Lily,	1
but	1
I	1
say,	1
no--the	1
princess!	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
it?	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
your	1
mother	1
will	1
be	1
grateful	1
to	1
me.	1
What	1
a	1
charming	1
girl	1
she	1
is,	1
really!	1
And	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
so	1
plain,	1
either."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas	1
as	1
if	1
offended	1
at	1
the	1
idea.	1
"As	1
befits	1
a	1
soldier,	1
Aunt,	1
I	1
don't	1
force	1
myself	1
on	1
anyone	1
or	1
refuse	1
anything,"	1
he	1
said	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
remember,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
joke!"	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
not!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
said	1
as	1
if	1
talking	1
to	1
herself.	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
among	1
other	1
things	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
attentive	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
blonde.	1
One	1
is	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
husband,	1
really...."	1
	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
we	1
are	1
good	1
friends	1
with	1
him,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
in	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
heart;	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
enter	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
a	1
pastime	1
so	1
pleasant	1
to	1
himself	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
pleasant	1
to	1
someone	1
else.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
nonsense	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife!"	1
thought	1
Nicholas	1
suddenly	1
at	1
supper.	1
"She	1
will	1
really	1
begin	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
match...	1
and	1
Sonya...?"	1
And	1
on	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife,	1
when	1
she	1
again	1
smilingly	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Well	1
then,	1
remember!"	1
he	1
drew	1
her	1
aside.	1
	1
"But	1
see	1
here,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
Aunt..."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
my	1
dear?	1
Come,	1
let's	1
sit	1
down	1
here,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
a	1
desire	1
and	1
need	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
most	1
intimate	1
thoughts	1
(which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
told	1
to	1
his	1
mother,	1
his	1
sister,	1
or	1
his	1
friend)	1
to	1
this	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
stranger.	1
When	1
he	1
afterwards	1
recalled	1
that	1
impulse	1
to	1
unsolicited	1
and	1
inexplicable	1
frankness	1
which	1
had	1
very	1
important	1
results	1
for	1
him,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him--as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
everyone	1
in	1
such	1
cases--that	1
it	1
was	1
merely	1
some	1
silly	1
whim	1
that	1
seized	1
him:	1
yet	1
that	1
burst	1
of	1
frankness,	1
together	1
with	1
other	1
trifling	1
events,	1
had	1
immense	1
consequences	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
family.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
Aunt,	1
Mamma	1
has	1
long	1
wanted	1
me	1
to	1
marry	1
an	1
heiress,	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
idea	1
of	1
marrying	1
for	1
money	1
is	1
repugnant	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
I	1
understand,"	1
said	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife.	1
	1
"But	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya--that's	1
another	1
matter.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
I	1
like	1
her	1
very	1
much,	1
I	1
feel	1
drawn	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
then,	1
after	1
I	1
met	1
her	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances--so	1
strangely,	1
the	1
idea	1
often	1
occurred	1
to	1
me:	1
'This	1
is	1
fate.'	1
Especially	1
if	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
Mamma	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
before,	1
somehow	1
it	1
had	1
always	1
happened	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
meet.	1
And	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
sister	1
Natasha	1
was	1
engaged	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
marrying	1
her.	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
happen	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
meet	1
her	1
just	1
when	1
Natasha's	1
engagement	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
off...	1
and	1
then	1
everything...	1
So	1
you	1
see...	1
I	1
never	1
told	1
this	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
never	1
will,	1
only	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
governor's	1
wife	1
pressed	1
his	1
elbow	1
gratefully.	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
Sonya,	1
my	1
cousin?	1
I	1
love	1
her,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
marry	1
her,	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
so....	1
So	1
you	1
see	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
about-"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
incoherently	1
and	1
blushing.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
boy,	1
what	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it!	1
You	1
know	1
Sonya	1
has	1
nothing	1
and	1
you	1
yourself	1
say	1
your	1
Papa's	1
affairs	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
way.	1
And	1
what	1
about	1
your	1
mother?	1
It	1
would	1
kill	1
her,	1
that's	1
one	1
thing.	1
And	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
Sonya--if	1
she's	1
a	1
girl	1
with	1
a	1
heart?	1
Your	1
mother	1
in	1
despair,	1
and	1
you	1
all	1
ruined....	1
No,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
and	1
Sonya	1
ought	1
to	1
understand	1
that."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
remained	1
silent.	1
It	1
comforted	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
these	1
arguments.	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same,	1
Aunt,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,"	1
he	1
rejoined	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause.	1
"Besides,	1
would	1
the	1
princess	1
have	1
me?	1
And	1
besides,	1
she	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
mourning.	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
think	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
don't	1
suppose	1
I'm	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
you	1
married	1
at	1
once?	1
There	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
right	1
way	1
of	1
doing	1
things,"	1
replied	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
matchmaker	1
you	1
are,	1
Aunt..."	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
kissing	1
her	1
plump	1
little	1
hand.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
Moscow	1
after	1
her	1
meeting	1
with	1
Rostov,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
found	1
her	1
nephew	1
there	1
with	1
his	1
tutor,	1
and	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
giving	1
her	1
instructions	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
her	1
Aunt	1
Malvintseva	1
at	1
Voronezh.	1
That	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
temptation	1
which	1
had	1
tormented	1
her	1
during	1
her	1
father's	1
illness,	1
since	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
especially	1
since	1
her	1
meeting	1
with	1
Rostov	1
was	1
smothered	1
by	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
journey,	1
anxiety	1
about	1
her	1
brother,	1
settling	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
house,	1
meeting	1
new	1
people,	1
and	1
attending	1
to	1
her	1
nephew's	1
education.	1
She	1
was	1
sad.	1
Now,	1
after	1
a	1
month	1
passed	1
in	1
quiet	1
surroundings,	1
she	1
felt	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
deeply	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
which	1
was	1
associated	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
with	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
Russia.	1
She	1
was	1
agitated	1
and	1
incessantly	1
tortured	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
dangers	1
to	1
which	1
her	1
brother,	1
the	1
only	1
intimate	1
person	1
now	1
remaining	1
to	1
her,	1
was	1
exposed.	1
She	1
was	1
worried	1
too	1
about	1
her	1
nephew's	1
education	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
herself	1
incompetent,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
she	1
felt	1
at	1
peace--a	1
peace	1
arising	1
from	1
consciousness	1
of	1
having	1
stifled	1
those	1
personal	1
dreams	1
and	1
hopes	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
awakening	1
within	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
related	1
to	1
her	1
meeting	1
with	1
Rostov.	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
her	1
party	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
Malvintseva	1
and,	1
after	1
discussing	1
her	1
plan	1
with	1
the	1
aunt,	1
remarked	1
that	1
though	1
under	1
present	1
circumstances	1
a	1
formal	1
betrothal	1
was,	1
of	1
course,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of,	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
together	1
and	1
could	1
get	1
to	1
know	1
one	1
another.	1
Malvintseva	1
expressed	1
approval,	1
and	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
Rostov	1
in	1
Mary's	1
presence,	1
praising	1
him	1
and	1
telling	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
blushed	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
name	1
was	1
mentioned.	1
But	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
experienced	1
a	1
painful	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
joyful	1
feeling--her	1
mental	1
tranquillity	1
was	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
desires,	1
doubts,	1
self-reproach,	1
and	1
hopes	1
reawoke.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
two	1
days	1
that	1
elapsed	1
before	1
Rostov	1
called,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
continually	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
behave	1
to	1
him.	1
First	1
she	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
when	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
aunt--that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
proper	1
for	1
her,	1
in	1
her	1
deep	1
mourning,	1
to	1
receive	1
visitors;	1
then	1
she	1
thought	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
rude	1
after	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
her;	1
then	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
aunt	1
and	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
had	1
intentions	1
concerning	1
herself	1
and	1
Rostov--their	1
looks	1
and	1
words	1
at	1
times	1
seemed	1
to	1
confirm	1
this	1
supposition--then	1
she	1
told	1
herself	1
that	1
only	1
she,	1
with	1
her	1
sinful	1
nature,	1
could	1
think	1
this	1
of	1
them:	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
forget	1
that	1
situated	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
while	1
still	1
wearing	1
deep	1
mourning,	1
such	1
matchmaking	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
father's	1
memory.	1
Assuming	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
imagined	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
these	1
words	1
sometimes	1
seemed	1
undeservedly	1
cold	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
mean	1
too	1
much.	1
More	1
than	1
anything	1
she	1
feared	1
lest	1
the	1
confusion	1
she	1
felt	1
might	1
overwhelm	1
her	1
and	1
betray	1
her	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
on	1
Sunday	1
after	1
church	1
the	1
footman	1
announced	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
that	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
had	1
called,	1
the	1
princess	1
showed	1
no	1
confusion,	1
only	1
a	1
slight	1
blush	1
suffused	1
her	1
cheeks	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
radiant	1
light.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
met	1
him,	1
Aunt?"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
calm	1
voice,	1
unable	1
herself	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
outwardly	1
so	1
calm	1
and	1
natural.	1
	1
When	1
Rostov	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
the	1
princess	1
dropped	1
her	1
eyes	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
visitor	1
time	1
to	1
greet	1
her	1
aunt,	1
and	1
then	1
just	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
met	1
his	1
look	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes.	1
With	1
a	1
movement	1
full	1
of	1
dignity	1
and	1
grace	1
she	1
half	1
rose	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure,	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
slender,	1
delicate	1
hand	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
new	1
deep	1
womanly	1
notes	1
vibrated.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
looked	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
bewildered	1
surprise.	1
Herself	1
a	1
consummate	1
coquette,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
maneuvered	1
better	1
on	1
meeting	1
a	1
man	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
attract.	1
	1
"Either	1
black	1
is	1
particularly	1
becoming	1
to	1
her	1
or	1
she	1
really	1
has	1
greatly	1
improved	1
without	1
my	1
having	1
noticed	1
it.	1
And	1
above	1
all,	1
what	1
tact	1
and	1
grace!"	1
thought	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
Had	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
been	1
capable	1
of	1
reflection	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
surprised	1
than	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
at	1
the	1
change	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
herself.	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
recognized	1
that	1
dear,	1
loved	1
face,	1
a	1
new	1
life	1
force	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
compelled	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
act	1
apart	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
will.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
Rostov	1
entered,	1
her	1
face	1
became	1
suddenly	1
transformed.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
light	1
had	1
been	1
kindled	1
in	1
a	1
carved	1
and	1
painted	1
lantern	1
and	1
the	1
intricate,	1
skillful,	1
artistic	1
work	1
on	1
its	1
sides,	1
that	1
previously	1
seemed	1
dark,	1
coarse,	1
and	1
meaningless,	1
was	1
suddenly	1
shown	1
up	1
in	1
unexpected	1
and	1
striking	1
beauty.	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
all	1
that	1
pure,	1
spiritual,	1
inward	1
travail	1
through	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
surface.	1
All	1
her	1
inward	1
labor,	1
her	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
herself,	1
her	1
sufferings,	1
her	1
strivings	1
after	1
goodness,	1
her	1
meekness,	1
love,	1
and	1
self-sacrifice--all	1
this	1
now	1
shone	1
in	1
those	1
radiant	1
eyes,	1
in	1
her	1
delicate	1
smile,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
trait	1
of	1
her	1
gentle	1
face.	1
	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
clearly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
whole	1
life.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
being	1
before	1
him	1
was	1
quite	1
different	1
from,	1
and	1
better	1
than,	1
anyone	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
before,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
better	1
than	1
himself.	1
	1
Their	1
conversation	1
was	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
unimportant.	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
war,	1
and	1
like	1
everyone	1
else	1
unconsciously	1
exaggerated	1
their	1
sorrow	1
about	1
it;	1
they	1
spoke	1
of	1
their	1
last	1
meeting--Nicholas	1
trying	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject--they	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
governor's	1
kind	1
wife,	1
of	1
Nicholas'	1
relations,	1
and	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary's.	1
	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
her	1
brother,	1
diverting	1
the	1
conversation	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
her	1
aunt	1
mentioned	1
Andrew.	1
Evidently	1
she	1
could	1
speak	1
of	1
Russia's	1
misfortunes	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
artificiality,	1
but	1
her	1
brother	1
was	1
too	1
near	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
she	1
neither	1
could	1
nor	1
would	1
speak	1
lightly	1
of	1
him.	1
Nicholas	1
noticed	1
this,	1
as	1
he	1
noticed	1
every	1
shade	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
character	1
with	1
an	1
observation	1
unusual	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
everything	1
confirmed	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
quite	1
unusual	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
being.	1
Nicholas	1
blushed	1
and	1
was	1
confused	1
when	1
people	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
princess	1
(as	1
she	1
did	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
mentioned)	1
and	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
her,	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
he	1
felt	1
quite	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
said	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
prepared,	1
but	1
what,	1
quite	1
appropriately,	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
moment.	1
	1
When	1
a	1
pause	1
occurred	1
during	1
his	1
short	1
visit,	1
Nicholas,	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
when	1
there	1
are	1
children,	1
turned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
little	1
son,	1
caressing	1
him	1
and	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
hussar.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
boy	1
on	1
his	1
knee,	1
played	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
With	1
a	1
softened,	1
happy,	1
timid	1
look	1
she	1
watched	1
the	1
boy	1
she	1
loved	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loved.	1
Nicholas	1
also	1
noticed	1
that	1
look	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
understanding	1
it,	1
flushed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
boy	1
with	1
good	1
natured	1
playfulness.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
mourning	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
society,	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
the	1
proper	1
thing	1
to	1
visit	1
her	1
again;	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
her	1
matchmaking,	1
passing	1
on	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
flattering	1
things	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
said	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
vice	1
versa,	1
and	1
insisting	1
on	1
his	1
declaring	1
himself	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
For	1
this	1
purpose	1
she	1
arranged	1
a	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
bishop's	1
house	1
before	1
Mass.	1
	1
Though	1
Rostov	1
told	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
any	1
declaration	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
As	1
at	1
Tilsit	1
Rostov	1
had	1
not	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
doubt	1
that	1
what	1
everybody	1
considered	1
right	1
was	1
right,	1
so	1
now,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
but	1
sincere	1
struggle	1
between	1
his	1
effort	1
to	1
arrange	1
his	1
life	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
sense	1
of	1
justice,	1
and	1
in	1
obedient	1
submission	1
to	1
circumstances,	1
he	1
chose	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
yielded	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
he	1
felt	1
irresistibly	1
carrying	1
him	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
where.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
after	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
Sonya	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
what	1
he	1
deemed	1
base	1
to	1
declare	1
his	1
feelings	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
And	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
act	1
basely.	1
But	1
he	1
also	1
knew	1
(or	1
rather	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart)	1
that	1
by	1
resigning	1
himself	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
circumstances	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
guiding	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
doing	1
nothing	1
wrong,	1
but	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
very	1
important--more	1
important	1
than	1
anything	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
done	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
After	1
meeting	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
though	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
went	1
on	1
externally	1
as	1
before,	1
all	1
his	1
former	1
amusements	1
lost	1
their	1
charm	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
often	1
thought	1
about	1
her.	1
But	1
he	1
never	1
thought	1
about	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
without	1
exception	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
society,	1
nor	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
rapturously,	1
thought	1
about	1
Sonya.	1
He	1
had	1
pictured	1
each	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
ladies	1
as	1
almost	1
all	1
honest-hearted	1
young	1
men	1
do,	1
that	1
is,	1
as	1
a	1
possible	1
wife,	1
adapting	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
married	1
life:	1
a	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
his	1
wife	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table,	1
his	1
wife's	1
carriage,	1
little	1
ones,	1
Mamma	1
and	1
Papa,	1
their	1
relations	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
so	1
on--and	1
these	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
pleasure.	1
But	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
engaged,	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
picture	1
anything	1
of	1
future	1
married	1
life.	1
If	1
he	1
tried,	1
his	1
pictures	1
seemed	1
incongruous	1
and	1
false.	1
It	1
made	1
him	1
afraid.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
The	1
dreadful	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
of	1
our	1
losses	1
in	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded,	1
and	1
the	1
still	1
more	1
terrible	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Moscow	1
reached	1
Voronezh	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
September.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
having	1
learned	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
wound	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
Gazette	1
and	1
having	1
no	1
definite	1
news	1
of	1
him,	1
prepared	1
(so	1
Nicholas	1
heard,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
again	1
himself)	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
Rostov	1
was	1
not	1
seized	1
with	1
despair,	1
anger,	1
the	1
desire	1
for	1
vengeance,	1
or	1
any	1
feeling	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
but	1
everything	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
dull	1
and	1
tiresome,	1
and	1
he	1
experienced	1
an	1
indefinite	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
awkwardness.	1
The	1
conversations	1
he	1
heard	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
insincere;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
judge	1
all	1
these	1
affairs	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
would	1
everything	1
again	1
become	1
clear	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
finish	1
buying	1
the	1
horses,	1
and	1
often	1
became	1
unreasonably	1
angry	1
with	1
his	1
servant	1
and	1
squadron	1
quartermaster.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
his	1
departure	1
a	1
special	1
thanksgiving,	1
at	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
present,	1
was	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
cathedral	1
for	1
the	1
Russian	1
victory.	1
He	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
governor	1
and	1
held	1
himself	1
with	1
military	1
decorum	1
through	1
the	1
service,	1
meditating	1
on	1
a	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
subjects.	1
When	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
beckoned	1
him	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
seen	1
the	1
princess?"	1
she	1
asked,	1
indicating	1
with	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
lady	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side,	1
beyond	1
the	1
choir.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
immediately	1
recognized	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
profile	1
he	1
saw	1
under	1
her	1
bonnet	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
solicitude,	1
timidity,	1
and	1
pity	1
that	1
immediately	1
overcame	1
him.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
evidently	1
engrossed	1
by	1
her	1
thoughts,	1
was	1
crossing	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
before	1
leaving	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
surprise.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
face	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
before,	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
general	1
expression	1
of	1
refined,	1
inner,	1
spiritual	1
labor,	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
differently	1
lit	1
up.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
pathetic	1
expression	1
of	1
sorrow,	1
prayer,	1
and	1
hope	1
in	1
it.	1
As	1
had	1
occurred	1
before	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
present,	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
prompted	1
by	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
and	1
not	1
asking	1
himself	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
proper	1
to	1
address	1
her	1
here	1
in	1
church,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
trouble	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
a	1
vivid	1
glow	1
kindled	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
lighting	1
up	1
both	1
her	1
sorrow	1
and	1
her	1
joy.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
Princess,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"It	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
your	1
brother,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Nikolievich,	1
were	1
not	1
living,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
once	1
announced	1
in	1
the	1
Gazette,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
colonel."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
not	1
grasping	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying,	1
but	1
cheered	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
regretful	1
sympathy	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
so	1
many	1
cases	1
of	1
a	1
splinter	1
wound"	1
(the	1
Gazette	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
shell)	1
"either	1
proving	1
fatal	1
at	1
once	1
or	1
being	1
very	1
slight,"	1
continued	1
Nicholas.	1
"We	1
must	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure..."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
dread..."	1
she	1
began	1
and,	1
prevented	1
by	1
agitation	1
from	1
finishing,	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
movement	1
as	1
graceful	1
as	1
everything	1
she	1
did	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
and,	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
gratefully,	1
went	1
out,	1
following	1
her	1
aunt.	1
	1
That	1
evening	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
out,	1
but	1
stayed	1
at	1
home	1
to	1
settle	1
some	1
accounts	1
with	1
the	1
horse	1
dealers.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
that	1
business	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere	1
but	1
still	1
too	1
early	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
reflecting	1
on	1
his	1
life,	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
rarely	1
did.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
agreeable	1
impression	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
her	1
in	1
Smolensk	1
province.	1
His	1
having	1
encountered	1
her	1
in	1
such	1
exceptional	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
having	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
mentioned	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
match,	1
had	1
drawn	1
his	1
particular	1
attention	1
to	1
her.	1
When	1
he	1
met	1
her	1
again	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
the	1
impression	1
she	1
made	1
on	1
him	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
pleasing	1
but	1
powerful.	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
peculiar	1
moral	1
beauty	1
he	1
observed	1
in	1
her	1
at	1
this	1
time.	1
He	1
was,	1
however,	1
preparing	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
entered	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
thus	1
depriving	1
himself	1
of	1
chances	1
of	1
meeting	1
her.	1
But	1
that	1
day's	1
encounter	1
in	1
church	1
had,	1
he	1
felt,	1
sunk	1
deeper	1
than	1
was	1
desirable	1
for	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind.	1
That	1
pale,	1
sad,	1
refined	1
face,	1
that	1
radiant	1
look,	1
those	1
gentle	1
graceful	1
gestures,	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
tender	1
sorrow	1
expressed	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
features	1
agitated	1
him	1
and	1
evoked	1
his	1
sympathy.	1
In	1
men	1
Rostov	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
higher	1
spiritual	1
life	1
(that	1
was	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
Prince	1
Andrew)	1
and	1
he	1
referred	1
to	1
it	1
contemptuously	1
as	1
philosophy	1
and	1
dreaminess,	1
but	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
very	1
sorrow	1
which	1
revealed	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
spiritual	1
world	1
foreign	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
an	1
irresistible	1
attraction.	1
	1
"She	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
wonderful	1
woman.	1
A	1
real	1
angel!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Why	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
free?	1
Why	1
was	1
I	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
with	1
Sonya?"	1
And	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
compared	1
the	1
two:	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
spirituality	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
other--a	1
spirituality	1
he	1
himself	1
lacked	1
and	1
therefore	1
valued	1
most	1
highly.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
picture	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
were	1
he	1
free.	1
How	1
he	1
would	1
propose	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
become	1
his	1
wife.	1
But	1
no,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
that.	1
He	1
felt	1
awed,	1
and	1
no	1
clear	1
picture	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
future	1
with	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
thought	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
picture	1
a	1
future	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
her	1
but	1
simply	1
loved	1
her.	1
	1
Reveries	1
about	1
Sonya	1
had	1
had	1
something	1
merry	1
and	1
playful	1
in	1
them,	1
but	1
to	1
dream	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
always	1
difficult	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
frightening.	1
	1
"How	1
she	1
prayed!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
her	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
prayer.	1
Yes,	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
prayer	1
that	1
moves	1
mountains,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
her	1
prayer	1
will	1
be	1
answered.	1
Why	1
don't	1
I	1
pray	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
want?"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
thought.	1
"What	1
do	1
I	1
want?	1
To	1
be	1
free,	1
released	1
from	1
Sonya...	1
She	1
was	1
right,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
remembering	1
what	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
had	1
said:	1
"Nothing	1
but	1
misfortune	1
can	1
come	1
of	1
marrying	1
Sonya.	1
Muddles,	1
grief	1
for	1
Mamma...	1
business	1
difficulties...	1
muddles,	1
terrible	1
muddles!	1
Besides,	1
I	1
don't	1
love	1
her--not	1
as	1
I	1
should.	1
O,	1
God!	1
release	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
dreadful,	1
inextricable	1
position!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
pray.	1
"Yes,	1
prayer	1
can	1
move	1
mountains,	1
but	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
faith	1
and	1
not	1
pray	1
as	1
Natasha	1
and	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
as	1
children,	1
that	1
the	1
snow	1
might	1
turn	1
into	1
sugar--	1
and	1
then	1
run	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
so.	1
No,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
praying	1
for	1
trifles	1
now,"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
pipe	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
and	1
folding	1
his	1
hands	1
placed	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
icon.	1
Softened	1
by	1
memories	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
pray	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
Tears	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
Lavrushka	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
some	1
papers.	1
	1
"Blockhead!	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
in	1
without	1
being	1
called?"	1
cried	1
Nicholas,	1
quickly	1
changing	1
his	1
attitude.	1
	1
"From	1
the	1
governor,"	1
said	1
Lavrushka	1
in	1
a	1
sleepy	1
voice.	1
"A	1
courier	1
has	1
arrived	1
and	1
there's	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
right,	1
thanks.	1
You	1
can	1
go!"	1
	1
Nicholas	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
letters,	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
Sonya.	1
He	1
recognized	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
handwriting	1
and	1
opened	1
Sonya's	1
first.	1
He	1
had	1
read	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
pale	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
opened	1
wide	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
joy.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
not	1
possible!"	1
he	1
cried	1
aloud.	1
	1
Unable	1
to	1
sit	1
still	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
holding	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
reading	1
it.	1
He	1
glanced	1
through	1
it,	1
then	1
read	1
it	1
again,	1
and	1
then	1
again,	1
and	1
standing	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
stretching	1
out	1
his	1
hands,	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
wide	1
open	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed.	1
What	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
praying	1
for	1
with	1
confidence	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
hear	1
him	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
astonished	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
unexpected,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
very	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
happened	1
so	1
quickly	1
proved	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
God	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
prayed,	1
but	1
by	1
some	1
ordinary	1
coincidence.	1
	1
This	1
unexpected	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Nicholas,	1
quite	1
voluntary	1
letter	1
from	1
Sonya	1
freed	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
knot	1
that	1
fettered	1
him	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
there	1
had	1
seemed	1
no	1
escape.	1
She	1
wrote	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
unfortunate	1
events--	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
Moscow	1
property--and	1
the	1
countess'	1
repeatedly	1
expressed	1
wish	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
should	1
marry	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
silence	1
and	1
coldness	1
of	1
late,	1
had	1
all	1
combined	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
decide	1
to	1
release	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
promise	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
completely	1
free.	1
	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
painful	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
sorrow	1
or	1
discord	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
(she	1
wrote),	1
and	1
my	1
love	1
has	1
no	1
aim	1
but	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
those	1
I	1
love;	1
so,	1
Nicholas,	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
consider	1
yourself	1
free,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
assured	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
everything,	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
love	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
does	1
	1
Your	1
Sonya	1
	1
Both	1
letters	1
were	1
written	1
from	1
Troitsa.	1
The	1
other,	1
from	1
the	1
countess,	1
described	1
their	1
last	1
days	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
their	1
departure,	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
property.	1
In	1
this	1
letter	1
the	1
countess	1
also	1
mentioned	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
wounded	1
traveling	1
with	1
them;	1
his	1
state	1
was	1
very	1
critical,	1
but	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
more	1
hope.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
nursing	1
him.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Nicholas	1
took	1
his	1
mother's	1
letter	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Neither	1
he	1
nor	1
she	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
what	1
"Natasha	1
nursing	1
him"	1
might	1
mean,	1
but	1
thanks	1
to	1
this	1
letter	1
Nicholas	1
suddenly	1
became	1
almost	1
as	1
intimate	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
relations.	1
	1
The	1
following	1
day	1
he	1
saw	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
off	1
on	1
her	1
journey	1
to	1
Yaroslavl,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
left	1
to	1
rejoin	1
his	1
regiment.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
Sonya's	1
letter	1
written	1
from	1
Troitsa,	1
which	1
had	1
come	1
as	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
Nicholas'	1
prayer,	1
was	1
prompted	1
by	1
this:	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
getting	1
Nicholas	1
married	1
to	1
an	1
heiress	1
occupied	1
the	1
old	1
countess'	1
mind	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
obstacle	1
to	1
this	1
happening,	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
countess'	1
house	1
had	1
grown	1
harder	1
and	1
harder,	1
especially	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Nicholas	1
telling	1
of	1
his	1
meeting	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
Bogucharovo.	1
The	1
countess	1
let	1
no	1
occasion	1
slip	1
of	1
making	1
humiliating	1
or	1
cruel	1
allusions	1
to	1
Sonya.	1
	1
But	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
they	1
left	1
Moscow,	1
moved	1
and	1
excited	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
she	1
called	1
Sonya	1
to	1
her	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
reproaching	1
and	1
making	1
demands	1
on	1
her,	1
tearfully	1
implored	1
her	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
herself	1
and	1
repay	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
family	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
her	1
by	1
breaking	1
off	1
her	1
engagement	1
with	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
till	1
you	1
promise	1
me	1
this."	1
	1
Sonya	1
burst	1
into	1
hysterical	1
tears	1
and	1
replied	1
through	1
her	1
sobs	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
and	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
anything,	1
but	1
gave	1
no	1
actual	1
promise	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
decide	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
her.	1
She	1
must	1
sacrifice	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
family	1
that	1
had	1
reared	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
up.	1
To	1
sacrifice	1
herself	1
for	1
others	1
was	1
Sonya's	1
habit.	1
Her	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
only	1
by	1
sacrifice	1
could	1
she	1
show	1
her	1
worth,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
this	1
and	1
loved	1
doing	1
it.	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
acts	1
of	1
self-sacrifice	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
happily	1
conscious	1
that	1
they	1
raised	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
esteem	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
so	1
made	1
her	1
more	1
worthy	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
whom	1
she	1
loved	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
constituted	1
the	1
whole	1
reward	1
for	1
her	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
she	1
felt	1
bitterness	1
against	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
benefactors	1
only	1
to	1
torture	1
her	1
the	1
more	1
painfully;	1
she	1
felt	1
jealous	1
of	1
Natasha	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
experienced	1
anything	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
had	1
never	1
needed	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
herself,	1
but	1
made	1
others	1
sacrifice	1
themselves	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
yet	1
was	1
beloved	1
by	1
everybody.	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
Sonya	1
felt	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
pure,	1
quiet	1
love	1
for	1
Nicholas	1
a	1
passionate	1
feeling	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
grow	1
up	1
which	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
principle,	1
virtue,	1
or	1
religion.	1
Under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
this	1
feeling	1
Sonya,	1
whose	1
life	1
of	1
dependence	1
had	1
taught	1
her	1
involuntarily	1
to	1
be	1
secretive,	1
having	1
answered	1
the	1
countess	1
in	1
vague	1
general	1
terms,	1
avoided	1
talking	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
she	1
should	1
see	1
Nicholas,	1
not	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
free	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
at	1
that	1
meeting	1
to	1
bind	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
forever.	1
	1
The	1
bustle	1
and	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
last	1
days	1
in	1
Moscow	1
stifled	1
the	1
gloomy	1
thoughts	1
that	1
oppressed	1
Sonya.	1
She	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
escape	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
practical	1
activity.	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
presence	1
in	1
their	1
house,	1
despite	1
her	1
sincere	1
pity	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
Natasha,	1
she	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
joyful	1
and	1
superstitious	1
feeling	1
that	1
God	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
separated	1
from	1
Nicholas.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
Natasha	1
loved	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
him.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
being	1
thrown	1
together	1
again	1
under	1
such	1
terrible	1
circumstances	1
they	1
would	1
again	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
then	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
marry	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
within	1
the	1
prohibited	1
degrees	1
of	1
affinity.	1
Despite	1
all	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
during	1
those	1
last	1
days	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
journey,	1
this	1
feeling	1
that	1
Providence	1
was	1
intervening	1
in	1
her	1
personal	1
affairs	1
cheered	1
Sonya.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
Troitsa	1
monastery	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
first	1
broke	1
their	1
journey	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day.	1
	1
Three	1
large	1
rooms	1
were	1
assigned	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
monastery	1
hostelry,	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
The	1
wounded	1
man	1
was	1
much	1
better	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
sat	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
respectfully	1
conversing	1
with	1
the	1
prior,	1
who	1
was	1
calling	1
on	1
them	1
as	1
old	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
benefactors	1
of	1
the	1
monastery.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
there	1
too,	1
tormented	1
by	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
talking	1
about.	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
voices	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
That	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
Natasha	1
came	1
out,	1
looking	1
excited.	1
Not	1
noticing	1
the	1
monk,	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
greet	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
drawing	1
back	1
the	1
wide	1
sleeve	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
arm,	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Sonya	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
about?	1
Come	1
here!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
Natasha	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
monk	1
for	1
his	1
blessing,	1
and	1
he	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
aid	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
His	1
saint.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
prior	1
withdrew,	1
Natasha	1
took	1
her	1
friend	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
unoccupied	1
room.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
will	1
he	1
live?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"Sonya,	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
how	1
unhappy!...	1
Sonya,	1
dovey,	1
everything	1
is	1
as	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
be.	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
lives!	1
He	1
cannot...	1
because...	1
because...	1
of"	1
and	1
Natasha	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
"Yes!	1
I	1
knew	1
it!	1
Thank	1
God!"	1
murmured	1
Sonya.	1
"He	1
will	1
live."	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
agitated	1
than	1
her	1
friend	1
by	1
the	1
latter's	1
fear	1
and	1
grief	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
personal	1
feelings	1
which	1
she	1
shared	1
with	1
no	1
one.	1
Sobbing,	1
she	1
kissed	1
and	1
comforted	1
Natasha.	1
"If	1
only	1
he	1
lives!"	1
she	1
thought.	1
Having	1
wept,	1
talked,	1
and	1
wiped	1
away	1
their	1
tears,	1
the	1
two	1
friends	1
went	1
together	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
door.	1
Natasha	1
opened	1
it	1
cautiously	1
and	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
Sonya	1
standing	1
beside	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
half-open	1
door.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
lying	1
raised	1
high	1
on	1
three	1
pillows.	1
His	1
pale	1
face	1
was	1
calm,	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
regular	1
breathing.	1
	1
"O,	1
Natasha!"	1
Sonya	1
suddenly	1
almost	1
screamed,	1
catching	1
her	1
companion's	1
arm	1
and	1
stepping	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"What?	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"It's	1
that,	1
that..."	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
face	1
and	1
trembling	1
lips.	1
	1
Natasha	1
softly	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
Sonya	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
not	1
yet	1
understanding	1
what	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
telling	1
her.	1
	1
"You	1
remember,"	1
said	1
Sonya	1
with	1
a	1
solemn	1
and	1
frightened	1
expression.	1
"You	1
remember	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
for	1
you...	1
at	1
Otradnoe	1
at	1
Christmas?	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
what	1
I	1
saw?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes!"	1
cried	1
Natasha	1
opening	1
her	1
eyes	1
wide,	1
and	1
vaguely	1
recalling	1
that	1
Sonya	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
something	1
about	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
lying	1
down.	1
	1
"You	1
remember?"	1
Sonya	1
went	1
on.	1
"I	1
saw	1
it	1
then	1
and	1
told	1
everybody,	1
you	1
and	1
Dunyasha.	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
lying	1
on	1
a	1
bed,"	1
said	1
she,	1
making	1
a	1
gesture	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
lifted	1
finger	1
at	1
each	1
detail,	1
"and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
was	1
covered	1
just	1
with	1
a	1
pink	1
quilt,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
folded,"	1
she	1
concluded,	1
convincing	1
herself	1
that	1
the	1
details	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
seen	1
were	1
exactly	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
mirror.	1
	1
She	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
seen	1
nothing	1
then	1
but	1
had	1
mentioned	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
head,	1
but	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
invented	1
then	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
real	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
recollection.	1
She	1
not	1
only	1
remembered	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
then	1
said--that	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
smiled	1
and	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
something	1
red--but	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
then	1
seen	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
pink	1
quilt	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
it	1
really	1
was	1
pink!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
now	1
thought	1
she	1
too	1
remembered	1
the	1
word	1
pink	1
being	1
used,	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
mysterious	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
prediction.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean?"	1
she	1
added	1
meditatively.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
so	1
strange,"	1
replied	1
Sonya,	1
clutching	1
at	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rang	1
and	1
Natasha	1
went	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
Sonya,	1
feeling	1
unusually	1
excited	1
and	1
touched,	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
thinking	1
about	1
the	1
strangeness	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
occurred.	1
	1
They	1
had	1
an	1
opportunity	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
send	1
letters	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
writing	1
to	1
her	1
son.	1
	1
"Sonya!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
raising	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
her	1
letter	1
as	1
her	1
niece	1
passed,	1
"Sonya,	1
won't	1
you	1
write	1
to	1
Nicholas?"	1
She	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
soft,	1
tremulous	1
voice,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
weary	1
eyes	1
that	1
looked	1
over	1
her	1
spectacles	1
Sonya	1
read	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
countess	1
meant	1
to	1
convey	1
with	1
these	1
words.	1
Those	1
eyes	1
expressed	1
entreaty,	1
shame	1
at	1
having	1
to	1
ask,	1
fear	1
of	1
a	1
refusal,	1
and	1
readiness	1
for	1
relentless	1
hatred	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
such	1
refusal.	1
	1
Sonya	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
and,	1
kneeling	1
down,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
will	1
write,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
softened,	1
excited,	1
and	1
touched	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
that	1
day,	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
mysterious	1
fulfillment	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
seen	1
of	1
her	1
vision.	1
Now	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
renewal	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
relations	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
would	1
prevent	1
Nicholas	1
from	1
marrying	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
she	1
was	1
joyfully	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
return	1
of	1
that	1
self-sacrificing	1
spirit	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
loved	1
to	1
live.	1
So	1
with	1
a	1
joyful	1
consciousness	1
of	1
performing	1
a	1
magnanimous	1
deed--interrupted	1
several	1
times	1
by	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
dimmed	1
her	1
velvety	1
black	1
eyes--she	1
wrote	1
that	1
touching	1
letter	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
amazed	1
Nicholas.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
and	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
arrested	1
Pierre	1
treated	1
him	1
with	1
hostility	1
but	1
yet	1
with	1
respect,	1
in	1
the	1
guardhouse	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
taken.	1
In	1
their	1
attitude	1
toward	1
him	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
felt	1
both	1
uncertainty	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
he	1
might	1
be--perhaps	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
person--and	1
hostility	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
their	1
recent	1
personal	1
conflict	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
guard	1
was	1
relieved	1
next	1
morning,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
new	1
guard--both	1
officers	1
and	1
men--he	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
interesting	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
his	1
captors;	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
the	1
guard	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
in	1
this	1
big,	1
stout	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
peasant	1
coat	1
the	1
vigorous	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
fought	1
so	1
desperately	1
with	1
the	1
marauder	1
and	1
the	1
convoy	1
and	1
had	1
uttered	1
those	1
solemn	1
words	1
about	1
saving	1
a	1
child;	1
they	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
only	1
No.	1
17	1
of	1
the	1
captured	1
Russians,	1
arrested	1
and	1
detained	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
by	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Higher	1
Command.	1
If	1
they	1
noticed	1
anything	1
remarkable	1
about	1
Pierre,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
his	1
unabashed,	1
meditative	1
concentration	1
and	1
thoughtfulness,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
spoke	1
French,	1
which	1
struck	1
them	1
as	1
surprisingly	1
good.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
placed	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
arrested	1
suspects,	1
as	1
the	1
separate	1
room	1
he	1
had	1
occupied	1
was	1
required	1
by	1
an	1
officer.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
Russians	1
confined	1
with	1
Pierre	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
lowest	1
class	1
and,	1
recognizing	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
they	1
all	1
avoided	1
him,	1
more	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
French.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
sad	1
at	1
hearing	1
them	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
That	1
evening	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
prisoners	1
(he,	1
probably,	1
among	1
them)	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
for	1
incendiarism.	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
a	1
French	1
general	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
mustache	1
sat	1
with	1
two	1
colonels	1
and	1
other	1
Frenchmen	1
with	1
scarves	1
on	1
their	1
arms.	1
With	1
the	1
precision	1
and	1
definiteness	1
customary	1
in	1
addressing	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
preclude	1
human	1
frailty,	1
Pierre	1
like	1
the	1
others	1
was	1
questioned	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been,	1
with	1
what	1
object,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
These	1
questions,	1
like	1
questions	1
put	1
at	1
trials	1
generally,	1
left	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
aside,	1
shut	1
out	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
that	1
essence's	1
being	1
revealed,	1
and	1
were	1
designed	1
only	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
channel	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
judges	1
wished	1
the	1
answers	1
of	1
the	1
accused	1
to	1
flow	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
desired	1
result,	1
namely	1
a	1
conviction.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Pierre	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
fit	1
in	1
with	1
that	1
aim,	1
the	1
channel	1
was	1
removed	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
could	1
flow	1
to	1
waste.	1
Pierre	1
felt,	1
moreover,	1
what	1
the	1
accused	1
always	1
feel	1
at	1
their	1
trial,	1
perplexity	1
as	1
to	1
why	1
these	1
questions	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
out	1
of	1
condescension	1
or	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
civility	1
that	1
this	1
device	1
of	1
placing	1
a	1
channel	1
was	1
employed.	1
He	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
men's	1
power,	1
that	1
only	1
by	1
force	1
had	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
there,	1
that	1
force	1
alone	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
demand	1
answers	1
to	1
their	1
questions,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sole	1
object	1
of	1
that	1
assembly	1
was	1
to	1
inculpate	1
him.	1
And	1
so,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
wish	1
to	1
inculpate	1
him,	1
this	1
expedient	1
of	1
an	1
inquiry	1
and	1
trial	1
seemed	1
unnecessary.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
any	1
answer	1
would	1
lead	1
to	1
conviction.	1
When	1
asked	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
arrested,	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
tragic	1
manner	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
restoring	1
to	1
its	1
parents	1
a	1
child	1
he	1
had	1
saved	1
from	1
the	1
flames.	1
Why	1
had	1
he	1
fought	1
the	1
marauder?	1
Pierre	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
"was	1
protecting	1
a	1
woman,"	1
and	1
that	1
"to	1
protect	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
being	1
insulted	1
was	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
every	1
man;	1
that..."	1
They	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
Why	1
was	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
house	1
where	1
witnesses	1
had	1
seen	1
him?	1
He	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Again	1
they	1
interrupted	1
him:	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
asked	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
but	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
found	1
near	1
the	1
fire?	1
Who	1
was	1
he?	1
they	1
asked,	1
repeating	1
their	1
first	1
question,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
declined	1
to	1
answer.	1
Again	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
it.	1
	1
"Put	1
that	1
down,	1
that's	1
bad...	1
very	1
bad,"	1
sternly	1
remarked	1
the	1
general	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
mustache	1
and	1
red	1
flushed	1
face.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
fires	1
broke	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
Zubovski	1
rampart.	1
	1
Pierre	1
and	1
thirteen	1
others	1
were	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
coach	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
merchant's	1
house	1
near	1
the	1
Crimean	1
bridge.	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
stifled	1
by	1
the	1
smoke	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
hang	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
city.	1
Fires	1
were	1
visible	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
realize	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fires	1
with	1
horror.	1
	1
He	1
passed	1
four	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
house	1
near	1
the	1
Crimean	1
bridge	1
and	1
during	1
that	1
time	1
learned,	1
from	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers,	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
confined	1
there	1
were	1
awaiting	1
a	1
decision	1
which	1
might	1
come	1
any	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
marshal.	1
What	1
marshal	1
this	1
was,	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
from	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
Evidently	1
for	1
them	1
"the	1
marshal"	1
represented	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
and	1
rather	1
mysterious	1
power.	1
	1
These	1
first	1
days,	1
before	1
the	1
eighth	1
of	1
September	1
when	1
the	1
prisoners	1
were	1
had	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
examination,	1
were	1
the	1
hardest	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
Pierre.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
On	1
the	1
eighth	1
of	1
September	1
an	1
officer--a	1
very	1
important	1
one	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
respect	1
the	1
guards	1
showed	1
him--entered	1
the	1
coach	1
house	1
where	1
the	1
prisoners	1
were.	1
This	1
officer,	1
probably	1
someone	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
was	1
holding	1
a	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
called	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
there,	1
naming	1
Pierre	1
as	1
"the	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
his	1
name."	1
Glancing	1
indolently	1
and	1
indifferently	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
he	1
ordered	1
the	1
officer	1
in	1
charge	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
decently	1
dressed	1
and	1
tidied	1
up	1
before	1
taking	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
marshal.	1
An	1
hour	1
later	1
a	1
squad	1
of	1
soldiers	1
arrived	1
and	1
Pierre	1
with	1
thirteen	1
others	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
Virgin's	1
Field.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
day,	1
sunny	1
after	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
unusually	1
pure.	1
The	1
smoke	1
did	1
not	1
hang	1
low	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
guardhouse	1
on	1
the	1
Zubovski	1
rampart,	1
but	1
rose	1
through	1
the	1
pure	1
air	1
in	1
columns.	1
No	1
flames	1
were	1
seen,	1
but	1
columns	1
of	1
smoke	1
rose	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
and	1
all	1
Moscow	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Pierre	1
could	1
see	1
was	1
one	1
vast	1
charred	1
ruin.	1
On	1
all	1
sides	1
there	1
were	1
waste	1
spaces	1
with	1
only	1
stoves	1
and	1
chimney	1
stacks	1
still	1
standing,	1
and	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
blackened	1
walls	1
of	1
some	1
brick	1
houses.	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
ruins	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
districts	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
well.	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
churches	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
burned.	1
The	1
Kremlin,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
destroyed,	1
gleamed	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
with	1
its	1
towers	1
and	1
the	1
belfry	1
of	1
Ivan	1
the	1
Great.	1
The	1
domes	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Convent	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin	1
glittered	1
brightly	1
and	1
its	1
bells	1
were	1
ringing	1
particularly	1
clearly.	1
These	1
bells	1
reminded	1
Pierre	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Sunday	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
Nativity	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin.	1
But	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
celebrate	1
this	1
holiday:	1
everywhere	1
were	1
blackened	1
ruins,	1
and	1
the	1
few	1
Russians	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
were	1
tattered	1
and	1
frightened	1
people	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
nest	1
was	1
ruined	1
and	1
destroyed,	1
but	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
order	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed,	1
Pierre	1
unconsciously	1
felt	1
that	1
a	1
quite	1
different,	1
firm,	1
French	1
order	1
had	1
been	1
established	1
over	1
this	1
ruined	1
nest.	1
He	1
felt	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
looks	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who,	1
marching	1
in	1
regular	1
ranks	1
briskly	1
and	1
gaily,	1
were	1
escorting	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
criminals;	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
looks	1
of	1
an	1
important	1
French	1
official	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
and	1
pair	1
driven	1
by	1
a	1
soldier,	1
whom	1
they	1
met	1
on	1
the	1
way.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
merry	1
sounds	1
of	1
regimental	1
music	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
felt	1
and	1
realized	1
it	1
especially	1
from	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
prisoners	1
the	1
French	1
officer	1
had	1
read	1
out	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
that	1
morning.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
one	1
set	1
of	1
soldiers	1
and	1
led	1
first	1
to	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
another	1
place	1
with	1
dozens	1
of	1
other	1
men,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
forgotten	1
him,	1
or	1
confused	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
others.	1
But	1
no:	1
the	1
answers	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
when	1
questioned	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
designation	1
as	1
"the	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
his	1
name,"	1
and	1
under	1
that	1
appellation,	1
which	1
to	1
Pierre	1
seemed	1
terrible,	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
leading	1
him	1
somewhere	1
with	1
unhesitating	1
assurance	1
on	1
their	1
faces	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
prisoners	1
were	1
exactly	1
the	1
ones	1
they	1
wanted	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
being	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
proper	1
place.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
insignificant	1
chip	1
fallen	1
among	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
a	1
machine	1
whose	1
action	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
but	1
which	1
was	1
working	1
well.	1
	1
He	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
prisoners	1
were	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin's	1
Field,	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
white	1
house	1
with	1
an	1
immense	1
garden	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
convent.	1
This	1
was	1
Prince	1
Shcherbitov's	1
house,	1
where	1
Pierre	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
in	1
other	1
days,	1
and	1
which,	1
as	1
he	1
learned	1
from	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
was	1
now	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
marshal,	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Eckmuhl	1
(Davout).	1
	1
They	1
were	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
one	1
by	1
one.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
the	1
sixth	1
to	1
enter.	1
He	1
was	1
conducted	1
through	1
a	1
glass	1
gallery,	1
an	1
anteroom,	1
and	1
a	1
hall,	1
which	1
were	1
familiar	1
to	1
him,	1
into	1
a	1
long	1
low	1
study	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
stood	1
an	1
adjutant.	1
	1
Davout,	1
spectacles	1
on	1
nose,	1
sat	1
bent	1
over	1
a	1
table	1
at	1
the	1
further	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
Davout,	1
evidently	1
consulting	1
a	1
paper	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him,	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
up.	1
Without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice:	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
silent	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
uttering	1
a	1
word.	1
To	1
him	1
Davout	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
French	1
general,	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
notorious	1
for	1
his	1
cruelty.	1
Looking	1
at	1
his	1
cold	1
face,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
like	1
a	1
stern	1
schoolmaster	1
who	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
wait	1
awhile	1
for	1
an	1
answer,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
every	1
instant	1
of	1
delay	1
might	1
cost	1
him	1
his	1
life;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
repeat	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
at	1
his	1
first	1
examination,	1
yet	1
to	1
disclose	1
his	1
rank	1
and	1
position	1
was	1
dangerous	1
and	1
embarrassing.	1
So	1
he	1
was	1
silent.	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
Davout	1
raised	1
his	1
head,	1
pushed	1
his	1
spectacles	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
forehead,	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
man,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
measured	1
tone,	1
evidently	1
calculated	1
to	1
frighten	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
chill	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
running	1
down	1
Pierre's	1
back	1
now	1
seized	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
vise.	1
	1
"You	1
cannot	1
know	1
me,	1
General,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
you..."	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
Russian	1
spy,"	1
Davout	1
interrupted,	1
addressing	1
another	1
general	1
who	1
was	1
present,	1
but	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
noticed.	1
	1
Davout	1
turned	1
away.	1
With	1
an	1
unexpected	1
reverberation	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
Pierre	1
rapidly	1
began:	1
	1
"No,	1
monseigneur,"	1
he	1
said,	1
suddenly	1
remembering	1
that	1
Davout	1
was	1
a	1
duke.	1
"No,	1
monseigneur,	1
you	1
cannot	1
have	1
known	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
militia	1
officer	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
quitted	1
Moscow."	1
	1
"Your	1
name?"	1
asked	1
Davout.	1
	1
"Bezukhov."	1
	1
"What	1
proof	1
have	1
I	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
lying?"	1
	1
"Monseigneur!"	1
exclaimed	1
Pierre,	1
not	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
pleading	1
voice.	1
	1
Davout	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
gazed	1
intently	1
at	1
him.	1
For	1
some	1
seconds	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
that	1
look	1
saved	1
Pierre.	1
Apart	1
from	1
conditions	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
law,	1
that	1
look	1
established	1
human	1
relations	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
men.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
things	1
passed	1
dimly	1
through	1
both	1
their	1
minds,	1
and	1
they	1
realized	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
children	1
of	1
humanity	1
and	1
were	1
brothers.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
first	1
glance,	1
when	1
Davout	1
had	1
only	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
the	1
papers	1
where	1
human	1
affairs	1
and	1
lives	1
were	1
indicated	1
by	1
numbers,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
circumstance,	1
and	1
Davout	1
could	1
have	1
shot	1
him	1
without	1
burdening	1
his	1
conscience	1
with	1
an	1
evil	1
deed,	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
human	1
being.	1
He	1
reflected	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
telling	1
the	1
truth?"	1
said	1
Davout	1
coldly.	1
	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
Ramballe,	1
and	1
named	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
the	1
street	1
where	1
the	1
house	1
was.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
what	1
you	1
say,"	1
returned	1
Davout.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
trembling,	1
faltering	1
voice	1
Pierre	1
began	1
adducing	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
statements.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
an	1
adjutant	1
entered	1
and	1
reported	1
something	1
to	1
Davout.	1
	1
Davout	1
brightened	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
news	1
the	1
adjutant	1
brought,	1
and	1
began	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
uniform.	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
Pierre.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
adjutant	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
prisoner,	1
he	1
jerked	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
direction	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
and	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
away.	1
But	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know:	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
coach	1
house	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
execution	1
his	1
companions	1
had	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
crossed	1
the	1
Virgin's	1
Field.	1
	1
He	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
adjutant	1
was	1
putting	1
another	1
question	1
to	1
Davout.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
of	1
course!"	1
replied	1
Davout,	1
but	1
what	1
this	1
"yes"	1
meant,	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
afterwards	1
remember	1
how	1
he	1
went,	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
far,	1
or	1
in	1
which	1
direction.	1
His	1
faculties	1
were	1
quite	1
numbed,	1
he	1
was	1
stupefied,	1
and	1
noticing	1
nothing	1
around	1
him	1
went	1
on	1
moving	1
his	1
legs	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
did	1
till	1
they	1
all	1
stopped	1
and	1
he	1
stopped	1
too.	1
The	1
only	1
thought	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
was:	1
who	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
had	1
really	1
sentenced	1
him	1
to	1
death?	1
Not	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
commission	1
that	1
had	1
first	1
examined	1
him--not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
wished	1
to	1
or,	1
evidently,	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
Davout,	1
who	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
so	1
human	1
a	1
way.	1
In	1
another	1
moment	1
Davout	1
would	1
have	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
wrong,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
adjutant	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
The	1
adjutant,	1
also,	1
had	1
evidently	1
had	1
no	1
evil	1
intent	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
refrained	1
from	1
coming	1
in.	1
Then	1
who	1
was	1
executing	1
him,	1
killing	1
him,	1
depriving	1
him	1
of	1
life--him,	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
memories,	1
aspirations,	1
hopes,	1
and	1
thoughts?	1
Who	1
was	1
doing	1
this?	1
And	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
one.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
system--a	1
concurrence	1
of	1
circumstances.	1
	1
A	1
system	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
was	1
killing	1
him--Pierre--depriving	1
him	1
of	1
life,	1
of	1
everything,	1
annihilating	1
him.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
From	1
Prince	1
Shcherbatov's	1
house	1
the	1
prisoners	1
were	1
led	1
straight	1
down	1
the	1
Virgin's	1
Field,	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
nunnery,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
a	1
kitchen	1
garden	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
post	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
up.	1
Beyond	1
that	1
post	1
a	1
fresh	1
pit	1
had	1
been	1
dug	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
near	1
the	1
post	1
and	1
the	1
pit	1
a	1
large	1
crowd	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle.	1
The	1
crowd	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
Russians	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
on	1
duty--Germans,	1
Italians,	1
and	1
Frenchmen,	1
in	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
uniforms.	1
To	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
stood	1
rows	1
of	1
French	1
troops	1
in	1
blue	1
uniforms	1
with	1
red	1
epaulets	1
and	1
high	1
boots	1
and	1
shakos.	1
	1
The	1
prisoners	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
order,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
list	1
(Pierre	1
was	1
sixth),	1
and	1
were	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
post.	1
Several	1
drums	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
beat	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
sound	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
away.	1
He	1
lost	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
thinking	1
or	1
understanding.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
hear	1
and	1
see.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
wish--	1
that	1
the	1
frightful	1
thing	1
that	1
had	1
to	1
happen	1
should	1
happen	1
quickly.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
fellow	1
prisoners	1
and	1
scrutinized	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
first	1
were	1
convicts	1
with	1
shaven	1
heads.	1
One	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
thin,	1
the	1
other	1
dark,	1
shaggy,	1
and	1
sinewy,	1
with	1
a	1
flat	1
nose.	1
The	1
third	1
was	1
a	1
domestic	1
serf,	1
about	1
forty-five	1
years	1
old,	1
with	1
grizzled	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
plump,	1
well-nourished	1
body.	1
The	1
fourth	1
was	1
a	1
peasant,	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
broad,	1
light-brown	1
beard	1
and	1
black	1
eyes.	1
The	1
fifth	1
was	1
a	1
factory	1
hand,	1
a	1
thin,	1
sallow-faced	1
lad	1
of	1
eighteen	1
in	1
a	1
loose	1
coat.	1
	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
the	1
French	1
consulting	1
whether	1
to	1
shoot	1
them	1
separately	1
or	1
two	1
at	1
a	1
time.	1
"In	1
couples,"	1
replied	1
the	1
officer	1
in	1
command	1
in	1
a	1
calm	1
voice.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
hurrying--not	1
as	1
men	1
hurry	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
they	1
understand,	1
but	1
as	1
people	1
hurry	1
to	1
finish	1
a	1
necessary	1
but	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
incomprehensible	1
task.	1
	1
A	1
French	1
official	1
wearing	1
a	1
scarf	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
row	1
of	1
prisoners	1
and	1
read	1
out	1
the	1
sentence	1
in	1
Russian	1
and	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
Then	1
two	1
pairs	1
of	1
Frenchmen	1
approached	1
the	1
criminals	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
officer's	1
command	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
convicts	1
who	1
stood	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
row.	1
The	1
convicts	1
stopped	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
post	1
and,	1
while	1
sacks	1
were	1
being	1
brought,	1
looked	1
dumbly	1
around	1
as	1
a	1
wounded	1
beast	1
looks	1
at	1
an	1
approaching	1
huntsman.	1
One	1
crossed	1
himself	1
continually,	1
the	1
other	1
scratched	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
lips	1
resembling	1
a	1
smile.	1
With	1
hurried	1
hands	1
the	1
soldiers	1
blindfolded	1
them,	1
drawing	1
the	1
sacks	1
over	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
bound	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
post.	1
	1
Twelve	1
sharpshooters	1
with	1
muskets	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ranks	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
regular	1
tread	1
and	1
halted	1
eight	1
paces	1
from	1
the	1
post.	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
away	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
crackling,	1
rolling	1
noise	1
was	1
heard	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
louder	1
than	1
the	1
most	1
terrific	1
thunder,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
round.	1
There	1
was	1
some	1
smoke,	1
and	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
were	1
doing	1
something	1
near	1
the	1
pit,	1
with	1
pale	1
faces	1
and	1
trembling	1
hands.	1
Two	1
more	1
prisoners	1
were	1
led	1
up.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
and	1
with	1
similar	1
looks,	1
these	1
two	1
glanced	1
vainly	1
at	1
the	1
onlookers	1
with	1
only	1
a	1
silent	1
appeal	1
for	1
protection	1
in	1
their	1
eyes,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
or	1
believe	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
to	1
them.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
because	1
they	1
alone	1
knew	1
what	1
their	1
life	1
meant	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
neither	1
understood	1
nor	1
believed	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
Again	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
look	1
and	1
again	1
turned	1
away;	1
but	1
again	1
the	1
sound	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
frightful	1
explosion	1
struck	1
his	1
ear,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
smoke,	1
blood,	1
and	1
the	1
pale,	1
scared	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
who	1
were	1
again	1
doing	1
something	1
by	1
the	1
post,	1
their	1
trembling	1
hands	1
impeding	1
one	1
another.	1
Pierre,	1
breathing	1
heavily,	1
looked	1
around	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
what	1
it	1
meant.	1
The	1
same	1
question	1
was	1
expressed	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
looks	1
that	1
met	1
his.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
without	1
exception,	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
same	1
dismay,	1
horror,	1
and	1
conflict	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
heart.	1
"But	1
who,	1
after	1
all,	1
is	1
doing	1
this?	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
suffering	1
as	1
I	1
am.	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
it?	1
Who?"	1
flashed	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
through	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"Sharpshooters	1
of	1
the	1
86th,	1
forward!"	1
shouted	1
someone.	1
The	1
fifth	1
prisoner,	1
the	1
one	1
next	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
led	1
away--alone.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
saved,	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
there	1
only	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
execution.	1
With	1
ever-growing	1
horror,	1
and	1
no	1
sense	1
of	1
joy	1
or	1
relief,	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place.	1
The	1
fifth	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
factory	1
lad	1
in	1
the	1
loose	1
cloak.	1
The	1
moment	1
they	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
sprang	1
aside	1
in	1
terror	1
and	1
clutched	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
(Pierre	1
shuddered	1
and	1
shook	1
himself	1
free.)	1
The	1
lad	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
walk.	1
They	1
dragged	1
him	1
along,	1
holding	1
him	1
up	1
under	1
the	1
arms,	1
and	1
he	1
screamed.	1
When	1
they	1
got	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
he	1
grew	1
quiet,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
suddenly	1
understood	1
something.	1
Whether	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
screaming	1
was	1
useless	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
incredible	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
kill	1
him,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
post,	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
blindfolded	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
wounded	1
animal	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
able	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
and	1
close	1
his	1
eyes.	1
His	1
curiosity	1
and	1
agitation,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd,	1
reached	1
the	1
highest	1
pitch	1
at	1
this	1
fifth	1
murder.	1
Like	1
the	1
others	1
this	1
fifth	1
man	1
seemed	1
calm;	1
he	1
wrapped	1
his	1
loose	1
cloak	1
closer	1
and	1
rubbed	1
one	1
bare	1
foot	1
with	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
blindfold	1
him	1
he	1
himself	1
adjusted	1
the	1
knot	1
which	1
hurt	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head;	1
then	1
when	1
they	1
propped	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
post,	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
and,	1
not	1
being	1
comfortable	1
in	1
that	1
position,	1
straightened	1
himself,	1
adjusted	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
leaned	1
back	1
again	1
more	1
comfortably.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
miss	1
his	1
slightest	1
movement.	1
	1
Probably	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
was	1
given	1
and	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
eight	1
muskets;	1
but	1
try	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
afterwards	1
remember	1
having	1
heard	1
the	1
slightest	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
shots.	1
He	1
only	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
workman	1
suddenly	1
sank	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
cords	1
that	1
held	1
him,	1
how	1
blood	1
showed	1
itself	1
in	1
two	1
places,	1
how	1
the	1
ropes	1
slackened	1
under	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
hanging	1
body,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
workman	1
sat	1
down,	1
his	1
head	1
hanging	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
one	1
leg	1
bent	1
under	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
post.	1
No	1
one	1
hindered	1
him.	1
Pale,	1
frightened	1
people	1
were	1
doing	1
something	1
around	1
the	1
workman.	1
The	1
lower	1
jaw	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
a	1
thick	1
mustache	1
trembled	1
as	1
he	1
untied	1
the	1
ropes.	1
The	1
body	1
collapsed.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
dragged	1
it	1
awkwardly	1
from	1
the	1
post	1
and	1
began	1
pushing	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
plainly	1
and	1
certainly	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
criminals	1
who	1
must	1
hide	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
their	1
guilt	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
pit	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
factory	1
lad	1
was	1
lying	1
with	1
his	1
knees	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
one	1
shoulder	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
other.	1
That	1
shoulder	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
rhythmically	1
and	1
convulsively,	1
but	1
spadefuls	1
of	1
earth	1
were	1
already	1
being	1
thrown	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
body.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
evidently	1
suffering,	1
shouted	1
gruffly	1
and	1
angrily	1
at	1
Pierre	1
to	1
go	1
back.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
and	1
remained	1
near	1
the	1
post,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
drove	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
pit	1
had	1
been	1
filled	1
up	1
a	1
command	1
was	1
given.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
taken	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
troops	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
made	1
a	1
half	1
turn	1
and	1
went	1
past	1
it	1
at	1
a	1
measured	1
pace.	1
The	1
twenty-four	1
sharpshooters	1
with	1
discharged	1
muskets,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
circle,	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
places	1
as	1
the	1
companies	1
passed	1
by.	1
	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
now	1
with	1
dazed	1
eyes	1
at	1
these	1
sharpshooters	1
who	1
ran	1
in	1
couples	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
circle.	1
All	1
but	1
one	1
rejoined	1
their	1
companies.	1
This	1
one,	1
a	1
young	1
soldier,	1
his	1
face	1
deadly	1
pale,	1
his	1
shako	1
pushed	1
back,	1
and	1
his	1
musket	1
resting	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
still	1
stood	1
near	1
the	1
pit	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
fired.	1
He	1
swayed	1
like	1
a	1
drunken	1
man,	1
taking	1
some	1
steps	1
forward	1
and	1
back	1
to	1
save	1
himself	1
from	1
falling.	1
An	1
old,	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
elbow	1
dragged	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
company.	1
The	1
crowd	1
of	1
Russians	1
and	1
Frenchmen	1
began	1
to	1
disperse.	1
They	1
all	1
went	1
away	1
silently	1
and	1
with	1
drooping	1
heads.	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
teach	1
them	1
to	1
start	1
fires,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchmen.	1
	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
speaker	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
relief	1
after	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done,	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
Without	1
finishing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
hopeless	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
After	1
the	1
execution	1
Pierre	1
was	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
placed	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
small,	1
ruined,	1
and	1
befouled	1
church.	1
	1
Toward	1
evening	1
a	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
entered	1
with	1
two	1
soldiers	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
pardoned	1
and	1
would	1
now	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
barracks	1
for	1
the	1
prisoners	1
of	1
war.	1
Without	1
understanding	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Pierre	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
They	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
sheds	1
built	1
of	1
charred	1
planks,	1
beams,	1
and	1
battens,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
darkness	1
some	1
twenty	1
different	1
men	1
surrounded	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
without	1
understanding	1
who	1
they	1
were,	1
why	1
they	1
were	1
there,	1
or	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
heard	1
what	1
they	1
said,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
kind	1
of	1
deduction	1
from	1
or	1
application	1
of	1
them.	1
He	1
replied	1
to	1
questions	1
they	1
put	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
who	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
replies,	1
nor	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
understand	1
them.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
their	1
faces	1
and	1
figures,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
equally	1
meaningless.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
had	1
witnessed	1
those	1
terrible	1
murders	1
committed	1
by	1
men	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
commit	1
them,	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
mainspring	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
on	1
which	1
everything	1
depended	1
and	1
which	1
made	1
everything	1
appear	1
alive,	1
had	1
suddenly	1
been	1
wrenched	1
out	1
and	1
everything	1
had	1
collapsed	1
into	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
meaningless	1
rubbish.	1
Though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
it	1
to	1
himself,	1
his	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
ordering	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
in	1
humanity,	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
soul,	1
and	1
in	1
God,	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed.	1
He	1
had	1
experienced	1
this	1
before,	1
but	1
never	1
so	1
strongly	1
as	1
now.	1
When	1
similar	1
doubts	1
had	1
assailed	1
him	1
before,	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
wrongdoing,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
that	1
relief	1
from	1
his	1
despair	1
and	1
from	1
those	1
doubts	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
within	1
himself.	1
But	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
universe	1
had	1
crumbled	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
only	1
meaningless	1
ruins	1
remained,	1
and	1
this	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
fault	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
regain	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
Around	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
men	1
were	1
standing	1
and	1
evidently	1
something	1
about	1
him	1
interested	1
them	1
greatly.	1
They	1
were	1
telling	1
him	1
something	1
and	1
asking	1
him	1
something.	1
Then	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
somewhere,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
among	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
laughing	1
and	1
talking	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
mates...	1
that	1
very	1
prince	1
who..."	1
some	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
was	1
saying,	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
who.	1
	1
Sitting	1
silent	1
and	1
motionless	1
on	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
straw	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
Pierre	1
sometimes	1
opened	1
and	1
sometimes	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
closed	1
them	1
he	1
saw	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
dreadful	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
factory	1
lad--	1
especially	1
dreadful	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
simplicity--and	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
murderers,	1
even	1
more	1
dreadful	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
disquiet.	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
again	1
and	1
stared	1
vacantly	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
Beside	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
stooping	1
position	1
sat	1
a	1
small	1
man	1
of	1
whose	1
presence	1
he	1
was	1
first	1
made	1
aware	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
smell	1
of	1
perspiration	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
him	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
moved.	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
though	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
continually	1
glanced	1
at	1
him.	1
On	1
growing	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
darkness	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
leg	1
bands,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
aroused	1
Pierre's	1
interest.	1
	1
Having	1
unwound	1
the	1
string	1
that	1
tied	1
the	1
band	1
on	1
one	1
leg,	1
he	1
carefully	1
coiled	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
immediately	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
leg,	1
glancing	1
up	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
While	1
one	1
hand	1
hung	1
up	1
the	1
first	1
string	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
already	1
unwinding	1
the	1
band	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
leg.	1
In	1
this	1
way,	1
having	1
carefully	1
removed	1
the	1
leg	1
bands	1
by	1
deft	1
circular	1
motions	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
following	1
one	1
another	1
uninterruptedly,	1
the	1
man	1
hung	1
the	1
leg	1
bands	1
up	1
on	1
some	1
pegs	1
fixed	1
above	1
his	1
head.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
knife,	1
cut	1
something,	1
closed	1
the	1
knife,	1
placed	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
bed,	1
and,	1
seating	1
himself	1
comfortably,	1
clasped	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
his	1
lifted	1
knees	1
and	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
latter	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
something	1
pleasant,	1
comforting,	1
and	1
well-rounded	1
in	1
these	1
deft	1
movements,	1
in	1
the	1
man's	1
well-ordered	1
arrangements	1
in	1
his	1
corner,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
very	1
smell,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
without	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
"You've	1
seen	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
trouble,	1
sir,	1
eh?"	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
suddenly	1
said.	1
	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
kindliness	1
and	1
simplicity	1
in	1
his	1
singsong	1
voice	1
that	1
Pierre	1
tried	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
his	1
jaw	1
trembled	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
tears	1
rising	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
The	1
little	1
fellow,	1
giving	1
Pierre	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
betray	1
his	1
confusion,	1
instantly	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
pleasant	1
tones:	1
	1
"Eh,	1
lad,	1
don't	1
fret!"	1
said	1
he,	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
singsong	1
caressing	1
voice	1
old	1
Russian	1
peasant	1
women	1
employ.	1
"Don't	1
fret,	1
friend--'suffer	1
an	1
hour,	1
live	1
for	1
an	1
age!'	1
that's	1
how	1
it	1
is,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
And	1
here	1
we	1
live,	1
thank	1
heaven,	1
without	1
offense.	1
Among	1
these	1
folk,	1
too,	1
there	1
are	1
good	1
men	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
bad,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
still	1
speaking,	1
he	1
turned	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
movement,	1
got	1
up,	1
coughed,	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
shed.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
you	1
rascal!"	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
voice	1
saying	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
shed.	1
"So	1
you've	1
come,	1
you	1
rascal?	1
She	1
remembers...	1
Now,	1
now,	1
that'll	1
do!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
soldier,	1
pushing	1
away	1
a	1
little	1
dog	1
that	1
was	1
jumping	1
up	1
at	1
him,	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
In	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
rag.	1
	1
"Here,	1
eat	1
a	1
bit,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he,	1
resuming	1
his	1
former	1
respectful	1
tone	1
as	1
he	1
unwrapped	1
and	1
offered	1
Pierre	1
some	1
baked	1
potatoes.	1
"We	1
had	1
soup	1
for	1
dinner	1
and	1
the	1
potatoes	1
are	1
grand!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
eaten	1
all	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
potatoes	1
seemed	1
extremely	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
thanked	1
the	1
soldier	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
"Well,	1
are	1
they	1
all	1
right?"	1
said	1
the	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"You	1
should	1
do	1
like	1
this."	1
	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
potato,	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
clasp	1
knife,	1
cut	1
the	1
potato	1
into	1
two	1
equal	1
halves	1
on	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
sprinkled	1
some	1
salt	1
on	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
rag,	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"The	1
potatoes	1
are	1
grand!"	1
he	1
said	1
once	1
more.	1
"Eat	1
some	1
like	1
that!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
eaten	1
anything	1
that	1
tasted	1
better.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I'm	1
all	1
right,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
shoot	1
those	1
poor	1
fellows?	1
The	1
last	1
one	1
was	1
hardly	1
twenty."	1
	1
"Tss,	1
tt...!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
man.	1
"Ah,	1
what	1
a	1
sin...	1
what	1
a	1
sin!"	1
he	1
added	1
quickly,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
always	1
waiting	1
ready	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
flew	1
out	1
involuntarily	1
he	1
went	1
on:	1
"How	1
was	1
it,	1
sir,	1
that	1
you	1
stayed	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
	1
"I	1
didn't	1
think	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
so	1
soon.	1
I	1
stayed	1
accidentally,"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
did	1
they	1
arrest	1
you,	1
dear	1
lad?	1
At	1
your	1
house?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
arrested	1
me	1
there,	1
and	1
tried	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
incendiary."	1
	1
"Where	1
there's	1
law	1
there's	1
injustice,"	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
man.	1
	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
here	1
long?"	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
as	1
he	1
munched	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
potato.	1
	1
"I?	1
It	1
was	1
last	1
Sunday	1
they	1
took	1
me,	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hospital	1
in	1
Moscow."	1
	1
"Why,	1
are	1
you	1
a	1
soldier	1
then?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
are	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
Apsheron	1
regiment.	1
I	1
was	1
dying	1
of	1
fever.	1
We	1
weren't	1
told	1
anything.	1
There	1
were	1
some	1
twenty	1
of	1
us	1
lying	1
there.	1
We	1
had	1
no	1
idea,	1
never	1
guessed	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
sad	1
here?"	1
Pierre	1
inquired.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
one	1
help	1
it,	1
lad?	1
My	1
name	1
is	1
Platon,	1
and	1
the	1
surname	1
is	1
Karataev,"	1
he	1
added,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
easier	1
for	1
Pierre	1
to	1
address	1
him.	1
"They	1
call	1
me	1
'little	1
falcon'	1
in	1
the	1
regiment.	1
How	1
is	1
one	1
to	1
help	1
feeling	1
sad?	1
Moscow--she's	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
cities.	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
see	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
not	1
feel	1
sad?	1
But	1
'the	1
maggot	1
gnaws	1
the	1
cabbage,	1
yet	1
dies	1
first';	1
that's	1
what	1
the	1
old	1
folks	1
used	1
to	1
tell	1
us,"	1
he	1
added	1
rapidly.	1
	1
"What?	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
say?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Who?	1
I?"	1
said	1
Karataev.	1
"I	1
say	1
things	1
happen	1
not	1
as	1
we	1
plan	1
but	1
as	1
God	1
judges,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
thinking	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
repeating	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
and	1
immediately	1
continued:	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
you,	1
have	1
you	1
a	1
family	1
estate,	1
sir?	1
And	1
a	1
house?	1
So	1
you	1
have	1
abundance,	1
then?	1
And	1
a	1
housewife?	1
And	1
your	1
old	1
parents,	1
are	1
they	1
still	1
living?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
And	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
dark	1
for	1
Pierre	1
to	1
see,	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
a	1
suppressed	1
smile	1
of	1
kindliness	1
puckered	1
the	1
soldier's	1
lips	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
these	1
questions.	1
He	1
seemed	1
grieved	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
no	1
parents,	1
especially	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
mother.	1
	1
"A	1
wife	1
for	1
counsel,	1
a	1
mother-in-law	1
for	1
welcome,	1
but	1
there's	1
none	1
as	1
dear	1
as	1
one's	1
own	1
mother!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Well,	1
and	1
have	1
you	1
little	1
ones?"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
asking.	1
	1
Again	1
Pierre's	1
negative	1
answer	1
seemed	1
to	1
distress	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
add:	1
	1
"Never	1
mind!	1
You're	1
young	1
folks	1
yet,	1
and	1
please	1
God	1
may	1
still	1
have	1
some.	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
harmony...."	1
	1
"But	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
now,"	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
rejoined	1
Karataev,	1
"never	1
decline	1
a	1
prison	1
or	1
a	1
beggar's	1
sack!"	1
	1
He	1
seated	1
himself	1
more	1
comfortably	1
and	1
coughed,	1
evidently	1
preparing	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
long	1
story.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
living	1
at	1
home,"	1
he	1
began.	1
"We	1
had	1
a	1
well-to-do	1
homestead,	1
plenty	1
of	1
land,	1
we	1
peasants	1
lived	1
well	1
and	1
our	1
house	1
was	1
one	1
to	1
thank	1
God	1
for.	1
When	1
Father	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
out	1
mowing	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
of	1
us.	1
We	1
lived	1
well.	1
We	1
were	1
real	1
peasants.	1
It	1
so	1
happened..."	1
	1
And	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
told	1
a	1
long	1
story	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
someone's	1
copse	1
to	1
take	1
wood,	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
keeper,	1
had	1
been	1
tried,	1
flogged,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
soldier.	1
	1
"Well,	1
lad,"	1
and	1
a	1
smile	1
changed	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
"we	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
misfortune	1
but	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
a	1
blessing!	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
my	1
sin,	1
my	1
brother	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
a	1
soldier.	1
But	1
he,	1
my	1
younger	1
brother,	1
had	1
five	1
little	1
ones,	1
while	1
I,	1
you	1
see,	1
only	1
left	1
a	1
wife	1
behind.	1
We	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
girl,	1
but	1
God	1
took	1
her	1
before	1
I	1
went	1
as	1
a	1
soldier.	1
I	1
come	1
home	1
on	1
leave	1
and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
it	1
was,	1
I	1
look	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
living	1
better	1
than	1
before.	1
The	1
yard	1
full	1
of	1
cattle,	1
the	1
women	1
at	1
home,	1
two	1
brothers	1
away	1
earning	1
wages,	1
and	1
only	1
Michael	1
the	1
youngest,	1
at	1
home.	1
Father,	1
he	1
says,	1
'All	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me:	1
it	1
hurts	1
the	1
same	1
whichever	1
finger	1
gets	1
bitten.	1
But	1
if	1
Platon	1
hadn't	1
been	1
shaved	1
for	1
a	1
soldier,	1
Michael	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
go.'	1
called	1
us	1
all	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
will	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
placed	1
us	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
icons.	1
'Michael,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'come	1
here	1
and	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
feet;	1
and	1
you,	1
young	1
woman,	1
you	1
bow	1
down	1
too;	1
and	1
you,	1
grandchildren,	1
also	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
him!	1
Do	1
you	1
understand?'	1
he	1
says.	1
That's	1
how	1
it	1
is,	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
Fate	1
looks	1
for	1
a	1
head.	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
always	1
judging,	1
'that's	1
not	1
well--that's	1
not	1
right!'	1
Our	1
luck	1
is	1
like	1
water	1
in	1
a	1
dragnet:	1
you	1
pull	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
bulges,	1
but	1
when	1
you've	1
drawn	1
it	1
out	1
it's	1
empty!	1
That's	1
how	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
And	1
Platon	1
shifted	1
his	1
seat	1
on	1
the	1
straw.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
he	1
rose.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
sleepy,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
began	1
rapidly	1
crossing	1
himself	1
and	1
repeating:	1
	1
"Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
holy	1
Saint	1
Nicholas,	1
Frola	1
and	1
Lavra!	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
holy	1
Saint	1
Nicholas,	1
Frola	1
and	1
Lavra!	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
save	1
us!"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
then	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
got	1
up,	1
sighed,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
on	1
his	1
heap	1
of	1
straw.	1
"That's	1
the	1
way.	1
Lay	1
me	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
stone,	1
O	1
God,	1
and	1
raise	1
me	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
loaf,"	1
he	1
muttered	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
down,	1
pulling	1
his	1
coat	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
prayer	1
was	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
saying?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Eh?"	1
murmured	1
Platon,	1
who	1
had	1
almost	1
fallen	1
asleep.	1
"What	1
was	1
I	1
saying?	1
I	1
was	1
praying.	1
Don't	1
you	1
pray?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
do,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"But	1
what	1
was	1
that	1
you	1
said:	1
Frola	1
and	1
Lavra?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course,"	1
replied	1
Platon	1
quickly,	1
"the	1
horses'	1
saints.	1
One	1
must	1
pity	1
the	1
animals	1
too.	1
Eh,	1
the	1
rascal!	1
Now	1
you've	1
curled	1
up	1
and	1
got	1
warm,	1
you	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
bitch!"	1
said	1
Karataev,	1
touching	1
the	1
dog	1
that	1
lay	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
again	1
turning	1
over	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
immediately.	1
	1
Sounds	1
of	1
crying	1
and	1
screaming	1
came	1
from	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
outside,	1
and	1
flames	1
were	1
visible	1
through	1
the	1
cracks	1
of	1
the	1
shed,	1
but	1
inside	1
it	1
was	1
quiet	1
and	1
dark.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
sleep,	1
but	1
lay	1
with	1
eyes	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
regular	1
snoring	1
of	1
Platon	1
who	1
lay	1
beside	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
shattered	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
stirring	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
beauty	1
and	1
on	1
new	1
and	1
unshakable	1
foundations.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
Twenty-three	1
soldiers,	1
three	1
officers,	1
and	1
two	1
officials	1
were	1
confined	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
in	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
remained	1
for	1
four	1
weeks.	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
them	1
afterwards	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
misty	1
figures	1
to	1
him	1
except	1
Platon	1
Karataev,	1
who	1
always	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
a	1
most	1
vivid	1
and	1
precious	1
memory	1
and	1
the	1
personification	1
of	1
everything	1
Russian,	1
kindly,	1
and	1
round.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
his	1
neighbor	1
next	1
morning	1
at	1
dawn	1
the	1
first	1
impression	1
of	1
him,	1
as	1
of	1
something	1
round,	1
was	1
fully	1
confirmed:	1
Platon's	1
whole	1
figure--in	1
a	1
French	1
overcoat	1
girdled	1
with	1
a	1
cord,	1
a	1
soldier's	1
cap,	1
and	1
bast	1
shoes--was	1
round.	1
His	1
head	1
was	1
quite	1
round,	1
his	1
back,	1
chest,	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
even	1
his	1
arms,	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
as	1
if	1
ever	1
ready	1
to	1
embrace	1
something,	1
were	1
rounded,	1
his	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
and	1
his	1
large,	1
gentle	1
brown	1
eyes	1
were	1
also	1
round.	1
	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
fifty,	1
judging	1
by	1
his	1
stories	1
of	1
campaigns	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in,	1
told	1
as	1
by	1
an	1
old	1
soldier.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know	1
his	1
age	1
and	1
was	1
quite	1
unable	1
to	1
determine	1
it.	1
But	1
his	1
brilliantly	1
white,	1
strong	1
teeth	1
which	1
showed	1
in	1
two	1
unbroken	1
semicircles	1
when	1
he	1
laughed--as	1
he	1
often	1
did--were	1
all	1
sound	1
and	1
good,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
gray	1
hair	1
in	1
his	1
beard	1
or	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
gave	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
suppleness	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
firmness	1
and	1
endurance.	1
	1
His	1
face,	1
despite	1
its	1
fine,	1
rounded	1
wrinkles,	1
had	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
innocence	1
and	1
youth,	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
pleasant	1
and	1
musical.	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
was	1
its	1
directness	1
and	1
appositeness.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
considered	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
or	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
consequently	1
the	1
rapidity	1
and	1
justice	1
of	1
his	1
intonation	1
had	1
an	1
irresistible	1
persuasiveness.	1
	1
His	1
physical	1
strength	1
and	1
agility	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
imprisonment	1
were	1
such	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
fatigue	1
and	1
sickness	1
meant.	1
Every	1
night	1
before	1
lying	1
down,	1
he	1
said:	1
"Lord,	1
lay	1
me	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
stone	1
and	1
raise	1
me	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
loaf!"	1
and	1
every	1
morning	1
on	1
getting	1
up,	1
he	1
said:	1
"I	1
lay	1
down	1
and	1
curled	1
up,	1
I	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
shake	1
myself."	1
And	1
indeed	1
he	1
only	1
had	1
to	1
lie	1
down,	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep	1
like	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
he	1
only	1
had	1
to	1
shake	1
himself,	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
without	1
a	1
moment's	1
delay	1
for	1
some	1
work,	1
just	1
as	1
children	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
play	1
directly	1
they	1
awake.	1
He	1
could	1
do	1
everything,	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
not	1
badly.	1
He	1
baked,	1
cooked,	1
sewed,	1
planed,	1
and	1
mended	1
boots.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
busy,	1
and	1
only	1
at	1
night	1
allowed	1
himself	1
conversation--of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
fond--and	1
songs.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
sing	1
like	1
a	1
trained	1
singer	1
who	1
knows	1
he	1
is	1
listened	1
to,	1
but	1
like	1
the	1
birds,	1
evidently	1
giving	1
vent	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
that	1
one	1
stretches	1
oneself	1
or	1
walks	1
about	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
stiffness,	1
and	1
the	1
sounds	1
were	1
always	1
high-pitched,	1
mournful,	1
delicate,	1
and	1
almost	1
feminine,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
was	1
very	1
serious.	1
	1
Having	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
and	1
allowed	1
his	1
beard	1
to	1
grow,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
thrown	1
off	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
upon	1
him--everything	1
military	1
and	1
alien	1
to	1
himself--and	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
peasant	1
habits.	1
	1
"A	1
soldier	1
on	1
leave--a	1
shirt	1
outside	1
breeches,"	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
talking	1
about	1
his	1
life	1
as	1
a	1
soldier,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
complain,	1
and	1
often	1
mentioned	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
flogged	1
once	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
service.	1
When	1
he	1
related	1
anything	1
it	1
was	1
generally	1
some	1
old	1
and	1
evidently	1
precious	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
"Christian"	1
life,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
peasant	1
existence.	1
The	1
proverbs,	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
talk	1
was	1
full,	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
not	1
the	1
coarse	1
and	1
indecent	1
saws	1
soldiers	1
employ,	1
but	1
those	1
folk	1
sayings	1
which	1
taken	1
without	1
a	1
context	1
seem	1
so	1
insignificant,	1
but	1
when	1
used	1
appositely	1
suddenly	1
acquire	1
a	1
significance	1
of	1
profound	1
wisdom.	1
	1
He	1
would	1
often	1
say	1
the	1
exact	1
opposite	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
on	1
a	1
previous	1
occasion,	1
yet	1
both	1
would	1
be	1
right.	1
He	1
liked	1
to	1
talk	1
and	1
he	1
talked	1
well,	1
adorning	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
terms	1
of	1
endearment	1
and	1
with	1
folk	1
sayings	1
which	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
he	1
invented	1
himself,	1
but	1
the	1
chief	1
charm	1
of	1
his	1
talk	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
commonest	1
events--sometimes	1
just	1
such	1
as	1
Pierre	1
had	1
witnessed	1
without	1
taking	1
notice	1
of	1
them--assumed	1
in	1
Karataev's	1
a	1
character	1
of	1
solemn	1
fitness.	1
He	1
liked	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
folk	1
tales	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
used	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
an	1
evening	1
(they	1
were	1
always	1
the	1
same),	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
liked	1
to	1
hear	1
stories	1
of	1
real	1
life.	1
He	1
would	1
smile	1
joyfully	1
when	1
listening	1
to	1
such	1
stories,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
putting	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
asking	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
moral	1
beauty	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
clear	1
to	1
himself.	1
Karataev	1
had	1
no	1
attachments,	1
friendships,	1
or	1
love,	1
as	1
Pierre	1
understood	1
them,	1
but	1
loved	1
and	1
lived	1
affectionately	1
with	1
everything	1
life	1
brought	1
him	1
in	1
contact	1
with,	1
particularly	1
with	1
man--not	1
any	1
particular	1
man,	1
but	1
those	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be.	1
He	1
loved	1
his	1
dog,	1
his	1
comrades,	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
neighbor,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Karataev's	1
affectionate	1
tenderness	1
for	1
him	1
(by	1
which	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
gave	1
Pierre's	1
spiritual	1
life	1
its	1
due)	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
grieved	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
parting	1
from	1
him.	1
And	1
Pierre	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
toward	1
Karataev.	1
	1
To	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
prisoners	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
seemed	1
a	1
most	1
ordinary	1
soldier.	1
They	1
called	1
him	1
"little	1
falcon"	1
or	1
"Platosha,"	1
chaffed	1
him	1
good-naturedly,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
on	1
errands.	1
But	1
to	1
Pierre	1
he	1
always	1
remained	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seemed	1
that	1
first	1
night:	1
an	1
unfathomable,	1
rounded,	1
eternal	1
personification	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
simplicity	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
knew	1
nothing	1
by	1
heart	1
except	1
his	1
prayers.	1
When	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
he	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
conclude.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
Pierre,	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
would	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
repeat	1
them,	1
but	1
Platon	1
could	1
never	1
recall	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
a	1
moment	1
before,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
never	1
could	1
repeat	1
to	1
Pierre	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
favorite	1
song:	1
native	1
and	1
birch	1
tree	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
sick	1
occurred	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
when	1
spoken	1
and	1
not	1
sung,	1
no	1
meaning	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
did	1
not,	1
and	1
could	1
not,	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
words	1
apart	1
from	1
their	1
context.	1
Every	1
word	1
and	1
action	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
an	1
activity	1
unknown	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
was	1
his	1
life.	1
But	1
his	1
life,	1
as	1
he	1
regarded	1
it,	1
had	1
no	1
meaning	1
as	1
a	1
separate	1
thing.	1
It	1
had	1
meaning	1
only	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
conscious.	1
His	1
words	1
and	1
actions	1
flowed	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
evenly,	1
inevitably,	1
and	1
spontaneously	1
as	1
fragrance	1
exhales	1
from	1
a	1
flower.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
value	1
or	1
significance	1
of	1
any	1
word	1
or	1
deed	1
taken	1
separately.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
heard	1
from	1
Nicholas	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
at	1
Yaroslavl	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
prepared	1
to	1
go	1
there,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
aunt's	1
efforts	1
to	1
dissuade	1
her--and	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
go	1
herself	1
but	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
nephew	1
with	1
her.	1
Whether	1
it	1
were	1
difficult	1
or	1
easy,	1
possible	1
or	1
impossible,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know:	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
duty,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
herself,	1
to	1
be	1
near	1
her	1
brother	1
who	1
was	1
perhaps	1
dying,	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
possible	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
prepared	1
to	1
set	1
off.	1
That	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
himself,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
attributed	1
to	1
his	1
being	1
too	1
weak	1
to	1
write	1
or	1
to	1
his	1
considering	1
the	1
long	1
journey	1
too	1
hard	1
and	1
too	1
dangerous	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
start.	1
Her	1
equipages	1
were	1
the	1
huge	1
family	1
coach	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
traveled	1
to	1
Voronezh,	1
a	1
semiopen	1
trap,	1
and	1
a	1
baggage	1
cart.	1
With	1
her	1
traveled	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
tutor,	1
her	1
old	1
nurse,	1
three	1
maids,	1
Tikhon,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
footman	1
and	1
courier	1
her	1
aunt	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
accompany	1
her.	1
	1
The	1
usual	1
route	1
through	1
Moscow	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
thought	1
of,	1
and	1
the	1
roundabout	1
way	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
through	1
Lipetsk,	1
Ryazan,	1
Vladimir,	1
and	1
Shuya	1
was	1
very	1
long	1
and,	1
as	1
post	1
horses	1
were	1
not	1
everywhere	1
obtainable,	1
very	1
difficult,	1
and	1
near	1
Ryazan	1
where	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
shown	1
themselves	1
was	1
even	1
dangerous.	1
	1
During	1
this	1
difficult	1
journey	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
Dessalles,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
servants	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
her	1
energy	1
and	1
firmness	1
of	1
spirit.	1
She	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
later	1
and	1
rose	1
earlier	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
no	1
difficulties	1
daunted	1
her.	1
Thanks	1
to	1
her	1
activity	1
and	1
energy,	1
which	1
infected	1
her	1
fellow	1
travelers,	1
they	1
approached	1
Yaroslavl	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
week.	1
	1
The	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
stay	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
Her	1
love	1
for	1
Rostov	1
no	1
longer	1
tormented	1
or	1
agitated	1
her.	1
It	1
filled	1
her	1
whole	1
soul,	1
had	1
become	1
an	1
integral	1
part	1
of	1
herself,	1
and	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
struggled	1
against	1
it.	1
Latterly	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
convinced	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
and	1
was	1
beloved,	1
though	1
she	1
never	1
said	1
this	1
definitely	1
to	1
herself	1
in	1
words.	1
She	1
had	1
become	1
convinced	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
her	1
last	1
interview	1
with	1
Nicholas,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
Not	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
had	1
Nicholas	1
alluded	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
relations	1
with	1
Natasha	1
might,	1
if	1
he	1
recovered,	1
be	1
renewed,	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
saw	1
by	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
thought	1
of	1
this.	1
	1
Yet	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that,	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
her--considerate,	1
delicate,	1
and	1
loving--not	1
only	1
remained	1
unchanged,	1
but	1
it	1
sometimes	1
seemed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
glad	1
that	1
the	1
family	1
connection	1
between	1
them	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
friendship	1
more	1
freely.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
only	1
time	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
beloved,	1
and	1
was	1
happy	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
But	1
this	1
happiness	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
spiritual	1
nature	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
her	1
feeling	1
grief	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
with	1
full	1
force;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
that	1
spiritual	1
tranquility	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
made	1
it	1
the	1
more	1
possible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
give	1
full	1
play	1
to	1
her	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
brother.	1
That	1
feeling	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
leaving	1
Voronezh	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
saw	1
her	1
off,	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
careworn,	1
despairing	1
face,	1
felt	1
sure	1
she	1
would	1
fall	1
ill	1
on	1
the	1
journey.	1
But	1
the	1
very	1
difficulties	1
and	1
preoccupations	1
of	1
the	1
journey,	1
which	1
she	1
took	1
so	1
actively	1
in	1
hand,	1
saved	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
from	1
her	1
grief	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
strength.	1
	1
As	1
always	1
happens	1
when	1
traveling,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
itself,	1
forgetting	1
its	1
object.	1
But	1
as	1
she	1
approached	1
Yaroslavl	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
await	1
her	1
there--not	1
after	1
many	1
days,	1
but	1
that	1
very	1
evening--again	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
agitation	1
increased	1
to	1
its	1
utmost	1
limit.	1
	1
The	1
courier	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
on	1
in	1
advance	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
staying	1
in	1
Yaroslavl,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
condition	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was,	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
big	1
coach	1
just	1
entering	1
the	1
town	1
gates	1
was	1
appalled	1
by	1
the	1
terrible	1
pallor	1
of	1
the	1
princess'	1
face	1
that	1
looked	1
out	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
everything,	1
your	1
excellency:	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
are	1
staying	1
at	1
the	1
merchant	1
Bronnikov's	1
house,	1
in	1
the	1
Square	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
here,	1
right	1
above	1
the	1
Volga,"	1
said	1
the	1
courier.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
frightened	1
inquiry,	1
not	1
understanding	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
chiefly	1
wanted	1
to	1
know:	1
how	1
was	1
her	1
brother?	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
put	1
that	1
question	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
the	1
prince?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"His	1
excellency	1
is	1
staying	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
them."	1
	1
"Then	1
he	1
is	1
alive,"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice:	1
"How	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"The	1
servants	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
still	1
the	1
same."	1
	1
What	1
"still	1
the	1
same"	1
might	1
mean	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
ask,	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
unnoticed	1
glance	1
at	1
little	1
seven-year-old	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
looking	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
town,	1
she	1
bowed	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
raise	1
it	1
again	1
till	1
the	1
heavy	1
coach,	1
rumbling,	1
shaking	1
and	1
swaying,	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop.	1
The	1
carriage	1
steps	1
clattered	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
let	1
down.	1
	1
The	1
carriage	1
door	1
was	1
opened.	1
On	1
the	1
left	1
there	1
was	1
water--a	1
great	1
river--and	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
a	1
porch.	1
There	1
were	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
entrance:	1
servants,	1
and	1
a	1
rosy	1
girl	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
plait	1
of	1
black	1
hair,	1
smiling	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
an	1
unpleasantly	1
affected	1
way.	1
(This	1
was	1
Sonya.)	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
steps.	1
"This	1
way,	1
this	1
way!"	1
said	1
the	1
girl,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
artificial	1
smile,	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
facing	1
an	1
elderly	1
woman	1
of	1
Oriental	1
type,	1
who	1
came	1
rapidly	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
emotion.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
countess.	1
She	1
embraced	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
"Mon	1
enfant!"	1
she	1
muttered,	1
"je	1
vous	1
aime	1
et	1
vous	1
connais	1
depuis	1
longtemps."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"My	1
child!	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
a	1
long	1
time."	1
	1
	1
Despite	1
her	1
excitement,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
realized	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
her.	1
Hardly	1
knowing	1
how	1
she	1
did	1
it,	1
she	1
contrived	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
few	1
polite	1
phrases	1
in	1
French	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
addressed	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
asked:	1
"How	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"The	1
doctor	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
danger,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
and	1
her	1
gesture	1
conveyed	1
a	1
contradiction	1
of	1
her	1
words.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?	1
Can	1
I	1
see	1
him--can	1
I?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"One	1
moment,	1
Princess,	1
one	1
moment,	1
my	1
dear!	1
Is	1
this	1
his	1
son?"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
turning	1
to	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
who	1
was	1
coming	1
in	1
with	1
Dessalles.	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
room	1
for	1
everybody,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
big	1
house.	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
lovely	1
boy!"	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
took	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
Sonya	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
The	1
countess	1
caressed	1
the	1
boy,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
welcomed	1
the	1
princess.	1
He	1
had	1
changed	1
very	1
much	1
since	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
last	1
seen	1
him.	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
brisk,	1
cheerful,	1
self-assured	1
old	1
man;	1
now	1
he	1
seemed	1
a	1
pitiful,	1
bewildered	1
person.	1
While	1
talking	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
continually	1
looked	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
everyone	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
the	1
right	1
thing.	1
After	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
property,	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
accustomed	1
groove	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
significance	1
and	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
life.	1
	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
one	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
brother	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
her	1
vexation	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
all	1
she	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
entertain	1
her	1
and	1
pretending	1
to	1
admire	1
her	1
nephew,	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
her	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
submitting,	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
to	1
this	1
new	1
order	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
entered.	1
She	1
knew	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
necessary,	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
vexed	1
with	1
these	1
people.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
niece,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
introducing	1
Sonya--"You	1
don't	1
know	1
her,	1
Princess?"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
turned	1
to	1
Sonya	1
and,	1
trying	1
to	1
stifle	1
the	1
hostile	1
feeling	1
that	1
arose	1
in	1
her	1
toward	1
the	1
girl,	1
she	1
kissed	1
her.	1
But	1
she	1
felt	1
oppressed	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
mood	1
of	1
everyone	1
around	1
her	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
heart.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?"	1
she	1
asked	1
again,	1
addressing	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
downstairs.	1
Natasha	1
is	1
with	1
him,"	1
answered	1
Sonya,	1
flushing.	1
"We	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
ask.	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
tired,	1
Princess."	1
	1
Tears	1
of	1
vexation	1
showed	1
themselves	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
eyes.	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
countess	1
again	1
how	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him,	1
when	1
light,	1
impetuous,	1
and	1
seemingly	1
buoyant	1
steps	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
princess	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
saw	1
Natasha	1
coming	1
in,	1
almost	1
running--	1
that	1
Natasha	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
liked	1
so	1
little	1
at	1
their	1
meeting	1
in	1
Moscow	1
long	1
since.	1
	1
But	1
hardly	1
had	1
the	1
princess	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
before	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
comrade	1
in	1
her	1
grief,	1
and	1
consequently	1
a	1
friend.	1
She	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
embraced	1
her,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Natasha,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
bed,	1
heard	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
arrival,	1
she	1
softly	1
left	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
those	1
swift	1
steps	1
that	1
had	1
sounded	1
buoyant	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
agitated	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room--that	1
of	1
love--boundless	1
love	1
for	1
him,	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loved;	1
and	1
of	1
pity,	1
suffering	1
for	1
others,	1
and	1
passionate	1
desire	1
to	1
give	1
herself	1
entirely	1
to	1
helping	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
Natasha's	1
heart	1
no	1
thought	1
of	1
herself	1
or	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
relations	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
with	1
her	1
acute	1
sensibility,	1
understood	1
all	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
at	1
Natasha's	1
face,	1
and	1
wept	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder	1
with	1
sorrowful	1
pleasure.	1
	1
"Come,	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
Mary,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
leading	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
room.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
raised	1
her	1
head,	1
dried	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
from	1
her	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
learn	1
everything.	1
	1
"How..."	1
she	1
began	1
her	1
question	1
but	1
stopped	1
short.	1
	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
ask,	1
or	1
to	1
answer,	1
in	1
words.	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
all	1
more	1
clearly	1
and	1
profoundly.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
her,	1
but	1
seemed	1
afraid	1
and	1
in	1
doubt	1
whether	1
to	1
say	1
all	1
she	1
knew	1
or	1
not;	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
before	1
those	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
which	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
depths	1
of	1
her	1
heart,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
which	1
she	1
saw.	1
And	1
suddenly,	1
Natasha's	1
lips	1
twitched,	1
ugly	1
wrinkles	1
gathered	1
round	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
covering	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
she	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
understood.	1
	1
But	1
she	1
still	1
hoped,	1
and	1
asked,	1
in	1
words	1
she	1
herself	1
did	1
not	1
trust:	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
is	1
his	1
wound?	1
What	1
is	1
his	1
general	1
condition?"	1
	1
"You,	1
you...	1
will	1
see,"	1
was	1
all	1
Natasha	1
could	1
say.	1
	1
They	1
sat	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
downstairs	1
near	1
his	1
room	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
off	1
crying	1
and	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
calm	1
faces.	1
	1
"How	1
has	1
his	1
whole	1
illness	1
gone?	1
Is	1
it	1
long	1
since	1
he	1
grew	1
worse?	1
When	1
did	1
this	1
happen?"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
inquired.	1
	1
Natasha	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
at	1
first	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
danger	1
from	1
his	1
feverish	1
condition	1
and	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
suffered,	1
but	1
at	1
Troitsa	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
afraid	1
of	1
gangrene.	1
That	1
danger	1
had	1
also	1
passed.	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
Yaroslavl	1
the	1
wound	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
fester	1
(Natasha	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
festering)	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
festering	1
might	1
take	1
a	1
normal	1
course.	1
Then	1
fever	1
set	1
in,	1
but	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
said	1
the	1
fever	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
serious.	1
	1
"But	1
two	1
days	1
ago	1
this	1
suddenly	1
happened,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
struggling	1
with	1
her	1
sobs.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
why,	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
like."	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
weaker?	1
Thinner?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
not	1
that,	1
but	1
worse.	1
You	1
will	1
see.	1
O,	1
Mary,	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
good,	1
he	1
cannot,	1
cannot	1
live,	1
because..."	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
When	1
Natasha	1
opened	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
familiar	1
movement	1
and	1
let	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
her,	1
the	1
princess	1
felt	1
the	1
sobs	1
in	1
her	1
throat.	1
Hard	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
prepare	1
herself,	1
and	1
now	1
tried	1
to	1
remain	1
tranquil,	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
tears.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
understood	1
what	1
Natasha	1
had	1
meant	1
by	1
the	1
words:	1
"two	1
days	1
ago	1
this	1
suddenly	1
happened."	1
She	1
understood	1
those	1
words	1
to	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
suddenly	1
softened	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
softening	1
and	1
gentleness	1
were	1
signs	1
of	1
approaching	1
death.	1
As	1
she	1
stepped	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
she	1
already	1
saw	1
in	1
imagination	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
remembered	1
it	1
in	1
childhood,	1
a	1
gentle,	1
mild,	1
sympathetic	1
face	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
rarely	1
shown,	1
and	1
which	1
therefore	1
affected	1
her	1
very	1
strongly.	1
She	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
speak	1
soft,	1
tender	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
such	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
uttered	1
before	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
and	1
would	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
Yet	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
in.	1
The	1
sobs	1
rose	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
in	1
her	1
throat	1
as	1
she	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
clearly	1
distinguished	1
his	1
form	1
and	1
her	1
shortsighted	1
eyes	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
his	1
features,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
met	1
his	1
gaze.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
squirrel-fur	1
dressing	1
gown	1
on	1
a	1
divan,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
pillows.	1
He	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
pale.	1
In	1
one	1
thin,	1
translucently	1
white	1
hand	1
he	1
held	1
a	1
handkerchief,	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
he	1
stroked	1
the	1
delicate	1
mustache	1
he	1
had	1
grown,	1
moving	1
his	1
fingers	1
slowly.	1
His	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
at	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
entered.	1
	1
On	1
seeing	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
meeting	1
his	1
eyes	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
pace	1
suddenly	1
slackened,	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
tears	1
dry	1
up	1
and	1
her	1
sobs	1
ceased.	1
She	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
guilty	1
and	1
grew	1
timid	1
on	1
catching	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
eyes.	1
	1
"But	1
in	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
blame?"	1
she	1
asked	1
herself.	1
And	1
his	1
cold,	1
stern	1
look	1
replied:	1
"Because	1
you	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
while	1
I..."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
deep	1
gaze	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
look	1
not	1
outwards	1
but	1
inwards	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
almost	1
hostile	1
expression	1
as	1
he	1
slowly	1
regarded	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
Natasha.	1
	1
He	1
kissed	1
his	1
sister,	1
holding	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
as	1
was	1
their	1
wont.	1
	1
"How	1
are	1
you,	1
Mary?	1
How	1
did	1
you	1
manage	1
to	1
get	1
here?"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
as	1
calm	1
and	1
aloof	1
as	1
his	1
look.	1
	1
Had	1
he	1
screamed	1
in	1
agony,	1
that	1
scream	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
struck	1
such	1
horror	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
heart	1
as	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
brought	1
little	1
Nicholas?"	1
he	1
asked	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
slow,	1
quiet	1
manner	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
obvious	1
effort	1
to	1
remember.	1
	1
"How	1
are	1
you	1
now?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
herself	1
surprised	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"That,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
must	1
ask	1
the	1
doctor,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
and	1
again	1
making	1
an	1
evident	1
effort	1
to	1
be	1
affectionate,	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
only	1
(his	1
words	1
clearly	1
did	1
not	1
correspond	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts):	1
	1
"Merci,	1
chere	1
amie,	1
d'etre	1
venue."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Thank	1
you	1
for	1
coming,	1
my	1
dear."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
pressure	1
made	1
him	1
wince	1
just	1
perceptibly.	1
He	1
was	1
silent,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
She	1
now	1
understood	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
two	1
days	1
before.	1
In	1
his	1
words,	1
his	1
tone,	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
that	1
calm,	1
almost	1
antagonistic	1
look	1
could	1
be	1
felt	1
an	1
estrangement	1
from	1
everything	1
belonging	1
to	1
this	1
world,	1
terrible	1
in	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
alive.	1
Evidently	1
only	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
did	1
he	1
understand	1
anything	1
living;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
failed	1
to	1
understand,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
lacked	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
understood	1
something	1
else--something	1
the	1
living	1
did	1
not	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
understand--and	1
which	1
wholly	1
occupied	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"There,	1
you	1
see	1
how	1
strangely	1
fate	1
has	1
brought	1
us	1
together,"	1
said	1
he,	1
breaking	1
the	1
silence	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
"She	1
looks	1
after	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
time."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
heard	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
such	1
a	1
thing.	1
He,	1
the	1
sensitive,	1
tender	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
how	1
could	1
he	1
say	1
that,	1
before	1
her	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
who	1
loved	1
him?	1
Had	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
live	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
that	1
offensively	1
cold	1
tone.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dying,	1
how	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
pity	1
her	1
and	1
how	1
could	1
he	1
speak	1
like	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
presence?	1
The	1
only	1
explanation	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
indifferent,	1
because	1
something	1
else,	1
much	1
more	1
important,	1
had	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
disconnected	1
and	1
continually	1
broke	1
off.	1
	1
"Mary	1
came	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
Ryazan,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
that	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
sister	1
Mary,	1
and	1
only	1
after	1
calling	1
her	1
so	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
did	1
Natasha	1
notice	1
it	1
herself.	1
	1
"Really?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"They	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
all	1
Moscow	1
has	1
been	1
burned	1
down,	1
and	1
that..."	1
	1
Natasha	1
stopped.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
talk.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
listen,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
say	1
it's	1
burned,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"It's	1
a	1
great	1
pity,"	1
and	1
he	1
gazed	1
straight	1
before	1
him,	1
absently	1
stroking	1
his	1
mustache	1
with	1
his	1
fingers.	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
you	1
have	1
met	1
Count	1
Nicholas,	1
Mary?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
suddenly	1
said,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
speak	1
pleasantly	1
to	1
them.	1
"He	1
wrote	1
here	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
great	1
liking	1
to	1
you,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
simply	1
and	1
calmly,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
all	1
the	1
complex	1
significance	1
his	1
words	1
had	1
for	1
living	1
people.	1
"If	1
you	1
liked	1
him	1
too,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
married,"	1
he	1
added	1
rather	1
more	1
quickly,	1
as	1
if	1
pleased	1
at	1
having	1
found	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
seeking.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
heard	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
meaning	1
for	1
her,	1
except	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
how	1
far	1
away	1
he	1
now	1
was	1
from	1
everything	1
living.	1
	1
"Why	1
talk	1
of	1
me?"	1
she	1
said	1
quietly	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
felt	1
her	1
glance,	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
All	1
three	1
were	1
again	1
silent.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
would	1
you	1
like..."	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
suddenly	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice,	1
"would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
little	1
Nicholas?	1
He	1
is	1
always	1
talking	1
about	1
you!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
just	1
perceptibly	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
knew	1
his	1
face	1
so	1
well,	1
saw	1
with	1
horror	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
smile	1
with	1
pleasure	1
or	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
but	1
with	1
quiet,	1
gentle	1
irony	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
she	1
was	1
trying	1
what	1
she	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
means	1
of	1
arousing	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Is	1
he	1
quite	1
well?"	1
	1
When	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
room	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
cry,	1
because	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
crying.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
kissed	1
him	1
and	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
When	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
led	1
away,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
again	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
tears	1
any	1
longer	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
attentively.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
about	1
Nicholas?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
nodded	1
her	1
head,	1
weeping.	1
	1
"Mary,	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
Gosp..."	1
but	1
he	1
broke	1
off.	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
you	1
say?"	1
	1
"Nothing.	1
You	1
mustn't	1
cry	1
here,"	1
he	1
said,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
cold	1
expression.	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
began	1
to	1
cry,	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
crying	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
be	1
left	1
without	1
a	1
father.	1
With	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
things	1
from	1
their	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
to	1
them	1
it	1
must	1
seem	1
sad!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"But	1
how	1
simple	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
"The	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
sow	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
reap,	1
yet	1
your	1
Father	1
feedeth	1
them,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary;	1
"but	1
no,	1
they	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
their	1
own	1
way,	1
they	1
won't	1
understand!	1
They	1
can't	1
understand	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
feelings	1
they	1
prize	1
so--all	1
our	1
feelings,	1
all	1
those	1
ideas	1
that	1
seem	1
so	1
important	1
to	1
us,	1
are	1
unnecessary.	1
We	1
cannot	1
understand	1
one	1
another,"	1
and	1
he	1
remained	1
silent.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
little	1
son	1
was	1
seven.	1
He	1
could	1
scarcely	1
read,	1
and	1
knew	1
nothing.	1
After	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
lived	1
through	1
many	1
things,	1
gaining	1
knowledge,	1
observation,	1
and	1
experience,	1
but	1
had	1
he	1
possessed	1
all	1
the	1
faculties	1
he	1
afterwards	1
acquired,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
better	1
or	1
more	1
profound	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
between	1
his	1
father,	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
then.	1
He	1
understood	1
it	1
completely,	1
and,	1
leaving	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
crying,	1
went	1
silently	1
up	1
to	1
Natasha	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
looked	1
shyly	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
beautiful,	1
thoughtful	1
eyes,	1
then	1
his	1
uplifted,	1
rosy	1
upper	1
lip	1
trembled	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
her	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
avoided	1
Dessalles	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
who	1
caressed	1
him	1
and	1
either	1
sat	1
alone	1
or	1
came	1
timidly	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
or	1
to	1
Natasha	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
seemed	1
even	1
fonder	1
than	1
of	1
his	1
aunt,	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
them	1
quietly	1
and	1
shyly.	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
left	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
she	1
fully	1
understood	1
what	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
had	1
told	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
any	1
more	1
to	1
Natasha	1
of	1
hopes	1
of	1
saving	1
his	1
life.	1
She	1
took	1
turns	1
with	1
her	1
beside	1
his	1
sofa,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
cry	1
any	1
more,	1
but	1
prayed	1
continually,	1
turning	1
in	1
soul	1
to	1
that	1
Eternal	1
and	1
Unfathomable,	1
whose	1
presence	1
above	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
evident.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
know	1
he	1
would	1
die,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dying	1
and	1
was	1
already	1
half	1
dead.	1
He	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
an	1
aloofness	1
from	1
everything	1
earthly	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
joyous	1
lightness	1
of	1
existence.	1
Without	1
haste	1
or	1
agitation	1
he	1
awaited	1
what	1
was	1
coming.	1
That	1
inexorable,	1
eternal,	1
distant,	1
and	1
unknown	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
continually	1
all	1
his	1
life--was	1
now	1
near	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
lightness	1
he	1
experienced,	1
almost	1
comprehensible	1
and	1
palpable...	1
	1
	1
Formerly	1
he	1
had	1
feared	1
the	1
end.	1
He	1
had	1
twice	1
experienced	1
that	1
terribly	1
tormenting	1
fear	1
of	1
death--the	1
end--but	1
now	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
understood	1
that	1
fear.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
felt	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
shell	1
spun	1
like	1
a	1
top	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fallow	1
field,	1
the	1
bushes,	1
and	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
death.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
after	1
being	1
wounded	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
eternal,	1
unfettered	1
love	1
had	1
instantly	1
unfolded	1
itself	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
as	1
if	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
bondage	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
restrained	1
it,	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
feared	1
death	1
and	1
ceased	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
hours	1
of	1
solitude,	1
suffering,	1
and	1
partial	1
delirium	1
he	1
spent	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
wounded,	1
the	1
more	1
deeply	1
he	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
new	1
principle	1
of	1
eternal	1
love	1
revealed	1
to	1
him,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
detached	1
himself	1
from	1
earthly	1
life.	1
To	1
love	1
everything	1
and	1
everybody	1
and	1
always	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
oneself	1
for	1
love	1
meant	1
not	1
to	1
love	1
anyone,	1
not	1
to	1
live	1
this	1
earthly	1
life.	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
imbued	1
he	1
became	1
with	1
that	1
principle	1
of	1
love,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
renounced	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
completely	1
he	1
destroyed	1
that	1
dreadful	1
barrier	1
which--in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
such	1
love--	1
stands	1
between	1
life	1
and	1
death.	1
When	1
during	1
those	1
first	1
days	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
die,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself:	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
it?	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better!"	1
	1
But	1
after	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
Mytishchi	1
when,	1
half	1
delirious,	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
longed	1
appear	1
before	1
him	1
and,	1
having	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
had	1
shed	1
gentle,	1
happy	1
tears,	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
particular	1
woman	1
again	1
crept	1
unobserved	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
life.	1
And	1
joyful	1
and	1
agitating	1
thoughts	1
began	1
to	1
occupy	1
his	1
mind.	1
Recalling	1
the	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
ambulance	1
station	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Kuragin,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
regain	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
then	1
had,	1
but	1
was	1
tormented	1
by	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
Kuragin	1
was	1
alive.	1
And	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
inquire.	1
	1
His	1
illness	1
pursued	1
its	1
normal	1
physical	1
course,	1
but	1
what	1
Natasha	1
referred	1
to	1
when	1
she	1
said:	1
"This	1
suddenly	1
happened,"	1
had	1
occurred	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
arrived.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
spiritual	1
struggle	1
between	1
life	1
and	1
death,	1
in	1
which	1
death	1
gained	1
the	1
victory.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
unexpected	1
realization	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
still	1
valued	1
life	1
as	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
a	1
last,	1
though	1
ultimately	1
vanquished,	1
attack	1
of	1
terror	1
before	1
the	1
unknown.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evening.	1
As	1
usual	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
was	1
slightly	1
feverish,	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
preternaturally	1
clear.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
table.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
doze.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
happiness	1
seized	1
him.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
she	1
has	1
come!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was:	1
in	1
Sonya's	1
place	1
sat	1
Natasha	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
in	1
noiselessly.	1
	1
Since	1
she	1
had	1
begun	1
looking	1
after	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
experienced	1
this	1
physical	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
nearness.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
placed	1
sideways,	1
screening	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
candle	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
knitting	1
a	1
stocking.	1
She	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
knit	1
stockings	1
since	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
casually	1
mentioned	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
nursed	1
the	1
sick	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
old	1
nurses	1
who	1
knit	1
stockings,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
soothing	1
in	1
the	1
knitting	1
of	1
stockings.	1
The	1
needles	1
clicked	1
lightly	1
in	1
her	1
slender,	1
rapidly	1
moving	1
hands,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
clearly	1
see	1
the	1
thoughtful	1
profile	1
of	1
her	1
drooping	1
face.	1
She	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
ball	1
rolled	1
off	1
her	1
knees.	1
She	1
started,	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
screening	1
the	1
candle	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
stooped	1
carefully	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
and	1
exact	1
movement,	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
ball,	1
and	1
regained	1
her	1
former	1
position.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
without	1
moving	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
draw	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
after	1
stooping,	1
but	1
refrained	1
from	1
doing	1
so	1
and	1
breathed	1
cautiously.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
Troitsa	1
monastery	1
they	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
lived	1
he	1
would	1
always	1
thank	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
wound	1
which	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
together	1
again,	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
future.	1
	1
"Can	1
it	1
or	1
can	1
it	1
not	1
be?"	1
he	1
now	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
click	1
of	1
the	1
steel	1
needles.	1
"Can	1
fate	1
have	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
strangely	1
only	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die?...	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
only	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spent	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
falsity?	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
I	1
love	1
her?"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
groaned,	1
from	1
a	1
habit	1
acquired	1
during	1
his	1
sufferings.	1
	1
On	1
hearing	1
that	1
sound	1
Natasha	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
stocking,	1
leaned	1
nearer	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
suddenly,	1
noticing	1
his	1
shining	1
eyes,	1
stepped	1
lightly	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
bent	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
asleep?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
you	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
I	1
felt	1
you	1
come	1
in.	1
No	1
one	1
else	1
gives	1
me	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
soft	1
tranquillity	1
that	1
you	1
do...	1
that	1
light.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
weep	1
for	1
joy."	1
	1
Natasha	1
drew	1
closer	1
to	1
him.	1
Her	1
face	1
shone	1
with	1
rapturous	1
joy.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
too	1
much!	1
More	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
	1
"And	1
I!"--She	1
turned	1
away	1
for	1
an	1
instant.	1
"Why	1
too	1
much?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Why	1
too	1
much?...	1
Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
in	1
your	1
soul,	1
your	1
whole	1
soul--shall	1
I	1
live?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
of	1
it,	1
sure!"	1
Natasha	1
almost	1
shouted,	1
taking	1
hold	1
of	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
passionate	1
movement.	1
	1
He	1
remained	1
silent	1
awhile.	1
	1
"How	1
good	1
it	1
would	1
be!"	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
kissed	1
it.	1
	1
Natasha	1
felt	1
happy	1
and	1
agitated,	1
but	1
at	1
once	1
remembered	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
quiet.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
slept,"	1
she	1
said,	1
repressing	1
her	1
joy.	1
"Try	1
to	1
sleep...	1
please!"	1
	1
He	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
released	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
candle	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
position.	1
Twice	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
met	1
his	1
beaming	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
set	1
herself	1
a	1
task	1
on	1
her	1
stocking	1
and	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
finished.	1
	1
Soon	1
he	1
really	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
long	1
and	1
suddenly	1
awoke	1
with	1
a	1
start	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
perspiration.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
now	1
always	1
occupied	1
his	1
mind--about	1
life	1
and	1
death,	1
and	1
chiefly	1
about	1
death.	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
nearer	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
"Love?	1
What	1
is	1
love?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
"Love	1
hinders	1
death.	1
Love	1
is	1
life.	1
All,	1
everything	1
that	1
I	1
understand,	1
I	1
understand	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
love.	1
Everything	1
is,	1
everything	1
exists,	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
love.	1
Everything	1
is	1
united	1
by	1
it	1
alone.	1
Love	1
is	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
die	1
means	1
that	1
I,	1
a	1
particle	1
of	1
love,	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
eternal	1
source."	1
These	1
thoughts	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
comforting.	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
thoughts.	1
Something	1
was	1
lacking	1
in	1
them,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
clear,	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
one-sidedly	1
personal	1
and	1
brain-spun.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
former	1
agitation	1
and	1
obscurity.	1
He	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
	1
He	1
dreamed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
really	1
was	1
in,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
well	1
and	1
unwounded.	1
Many	1
various,	1
indifferent,	1
and	1
insignificant	1
people	1
appeared	1
before	1
him.	1
He	1
talked	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
discussed	1
something	1
trivial.	1
They	1
were	1
preparing	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
somewhere.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
dimly	1
realized	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
trivial	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
important	1
cares,	1
but	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
speak,	1
surprising	1
them	1
by	1
empty	1
witticisms.	1
Gradually,	1
unnoticed,	1
all	1
these	1
persons	1
began	1
to	1
disappear	1
and	1
a	1
single	1
question,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
closed	1
door,	1
superseded	1
all	1
else.	1
He	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
bolt	1
and	1
lock	1
it.	1
Everything	1
depended	1
on	1
whether	1
he	1
was,	1
or	1
was	1
not,	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
lock	1
it.	1
He	1
went,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
hurry,	1
but	1
his	1
legs	1
refused	1
to	1
move	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
lock	1
the	1
door	1
though	1
he	1
painfully	1
strained	1
all	1
his	1
powers.	1
He	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
an	1
agonizing	1
fear.	1
And	1
that	1
fear	1
was	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
death.	1
It	1
stood	1
behind	1
the	1
door.	1
But	1
just	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
clumsily	1
creeping	1
toward	1
the	1
door,	1
that	1
dreadful	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
was	1
already	1
pressing	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
forcing	1
its	1
way	1
in.	1
Something	1
not	1
human--death--was	1
breaking	1
in	1
through	1
that	1
door,	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
out.	1
He	1
seized	1
the	1
door,	1
making	1
a	1
final	1
effort	1
to	1
hold	1
it	1
back--to	1
lock	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
possible--but	1
his	1
efforts	1
were	1
weak	1
and	1
clumsy	1
and	1
the	1
door,	1
pushed	1
from	1
behind	1
by	1
that	1
terror,	1
opened	1
and	1
closed	1
again.	1
	1
Once	1
again	1
it	1
pushed	1
from	1
outside.	1
His	1
last	1
superhuman	1
efforts	1
were	1
vain	1
and	1
both	1
halves	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
noiselessly	1
opened.	1
It	1
entered,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
death,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
died.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
died,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asleep,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
died,	1
having	1
made	1
an	1
effort,	1
he	1
awoke.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
death!	1
I	1
died--and	1
woke	1
up.	1
Yes,	1
death	1
is	1
an	1
awakening!"	1
And	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
grew	1
light	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
the	1
veil	1
that	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
concealed	1
the	1
unknown	1
was	1
lifted	1
from	1
his	1
spiritual	1
vision.	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
powers	1
till	1
then	1
confined	1
within	1
him	1
had	1
been	1
liberated,	1
and	1
that	1
strange	1
lightness	1
did	1
not	1
again	1
leave	1
him.	1
	1
When,	1
waking	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
perspiration,	1
he	1
moved	1
on	1
the	1
divan,	1
Natasha	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
strangely,	1
not	1
understanding.	1
	1
That	1
was	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
arrival.	1
From	1
that	1
day,	1
as	1
the	1
doctor	1
expressed	1
it,	1
the	1
wasting	1
fever	1
assumed	1
a	1
malignant	1
character,	1
but	1
what	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
Natasha,	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
terrible	1
moral	1
symptoms	1
which	1
to	1
her	1
were	1
more	1
convincing.	1
	1
From	1
that	1
day	1
an	1
awakening	1
from	1
life	1
came	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
awakening	1
from	1
sleep.	1
And	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
life	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
slower	1
than	1
an	1
awakening	1
from	1
sleep	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
terrible	1
or	1
violent	1
in	1
this	1
comparatively	1
slow	1
awakening.	1
	1
His	1
last	1
days	1
and	1
hours	1
passed	1
in	1
an	1
ordinary	1
and	1
simple	1
way.	1
Both	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
him,	1
felt	1
this.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
weep	1
or	1
shudder	1
and	1
during	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
they	1
themselves	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
attending	1
on	1
him	1
(he	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there,	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
them)	1
but	1
on	1
what	1
reminded	1
them	1
most	1
closely	1
of	1
him--his	1
body.	1
Both	1
felt	1
this	1
so	1
strongly	1
that	1
the	1
outward	1
and	1
terrible	1
side	1
of	1
death	1
did	1
not	1
affect	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
foment	1
their	1
grief.	1
Neither	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
nor	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
did	1
they	1
weep,	1
nor	1
did	1
they	1
ever	1
talk	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
about	1
him.	1
They	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
express	1
in	1
words	1
what	1
they	1
understood.	1
	1
They	1
both	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sinking	1
slowly	1
and	1
quietly,	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper,	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
right.	1
	1
He	1
confessed,	1
and	1
received	1
communion:	1
everyone	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
him.	1
When	1
they	1
brought	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
pressed	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
the	1
boy's	1
and	1
turned	1
away,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
hard	1
and	1
sad	1
(Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
understood	1
that)	1
but	1
simply	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
required	1
of	1
him,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
bless	1
the	1
boy,	1
he	1
did	1
what	1
was	1
demanded	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
whether	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
else	1
he	1
should	1
do.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
last	1
convulsions	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
the	1
spirit	1
was	1
leaving,	1
occurred,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
present.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
over?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
when	1
his	1
body	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
lain	1
motionless,	1
growing	1
cold	1
before	1
them.	1
Natasha	1
went	1
up,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
close	1
them.	1
She	1
closed	1
them	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
kiss	1
them,	1
but	1
clung	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
reminded	1
her	1
most	1
nearly	1
of	1
him--his	1
body.	1
	1
"Where	1
has	1
he	1
gone?	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
now?..."	1
	1
When	1
the	1
body,	1
washed	1
and	1
dressed,	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
on	1
a	1
table,	1
everyone	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
wept.	1
	1
Little	1
Nicholas	1
cried	1
because	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
rent	1
by	1
painful	1
perplexity.	1
The	1
countess	1
and	1
Sonya	1
cried	1
from	1
pity	1
for	1
Natasha	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
more.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
cried	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
before	1
long,	1
he,	1
too,	1
must	1
take	1
the	1
same	1
terrible	1
step.	1
	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
also	1
wept	1
now,	1
but	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
personal	1
grief;	1
they	1
wept	1
with	1
a	1
reverent	1
and	1
softening	1
emotion	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
at	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
simple	1
and	1
solemn	1
mystery	1
of	1
death	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
accomplished	1
in	1
their	1
presence.	1

THIRTEEN:	1

	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Man's	1
mind	1
cannot	1
grasp	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
their	1
completeness,	1
but	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
find	1
those	1
causes	1
is	1
implanted	1
in	1
man's	1
soul.	1
And	1
without	1
considering	1
the	1
multiplicity	1
and	1
complexity	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
taken	1
separately	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
cause,	1
he	1
snatches	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
approximation	1
to	1
a	1
cause	1
that	1
seems	1
to	1
him	1
intelligible	1
and	1
says:	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
cause!"	1
In	1
historical	1
events	1
(where	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
observation)	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
most	1
primitive	1
approximation	1
to	1
present	1
itself	1
was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
and,	1
after	1
that,	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
prominent	1
position--the	1
heroes	1
of	1
history.	1
But	1
we	1
need	1
only	1
penetrate	1
to	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
any	1
historic	1
event--which	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
mass	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
it--to	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
historic	1
hero	1
does	1
not	1
control	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
but	1
is	1
itself	1
continually	1
controlled.	1
It	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference	1
whether	1
we	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
historical	1
events	1
this	1
way	1
or	1
that;	1
yet	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
West	1
moved	1
on	1
the	1
East	1
because	1
Napoleon	1
wished	1
it	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
this	1
happened	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
happen,	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
between	1
those	1
who	1
declared	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
stationary	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
planets	1
moved	1
round	1
it	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
admitted	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
upheld	1
the	1
earth,	1
but	1
knew	1
there	1
were	1
laws	1
directing	1
its	1
movement	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
planets.	1
There	1
is,	1
and	1
can	1
be,	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
an	1
historical	1
event	1
except	1
the	1
one	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
causes.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
laws	1
directing	1
events,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
laws	1
are	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
conscious	1
of	1
others	1
we	1
cannot	1
comprehend.	1
The	1
discovery	1
of	1
these	1
laws	1
is	1
only	1
possible	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
quite	1
abandoned	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
cause	1
in	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
man,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
planets	1
was	1
possible	1
only	1
when	1
men	1
abandoned	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
fixity	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
The	1
historians	1
consider	1
that,	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
Moscow	1
by	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
its	1
destruction	1
by	1
fire,	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
episode	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
of	1
1812	1
was	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
from	1
the	1
Ryazana	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Tarutino	1
camp--the	1
so-called	1
flank	1
march	1
across	1
the	1
Krasnaya	1
Pakhra	1
River.	1
They	1
ascribe	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
that	1
achievement	1
of	1
genius	1
to	1
different	1
men	1
and	1
dispute	1
as	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
honor	1
is	1
due.	1
Even	1
foreign	1
historians,	1
including	1
the	1
French,	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
when	1
they	1
speak	1
of	1
that	1
flank	1
march.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
understand	1
why	1
military	1
writers,	1
and	1
following	1
them	1
others,	1
consider	1
this	1
flank	1
march	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
profound	1
conception	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
man	1
who	1
saved	1
Russia	1
and	1
destroyed	1
Napoleon.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
understand	1
where	1
the	1
profundity	1
and	1
genius	1
of	1
this	1
movement	1
lay,	1
for	1
not	1
much	1
mental	1
effort	1
was	1
needed	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
position	1
for	1
an	1
army	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
being	1
attacked	1
is	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
most	1
provisions;	1
and	1
even	1
a	1
dull	1
boy	1
of	1
thirteen	1
could	1
have	1
guessed	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
position	1
for	1
an	1
army	1
after	1
its	1
retreat	1
from	1
Moscow	1
in	1
1812	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
So	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
understand	1
by	1
what	1
reasoning	1
the	1
historians	1
reach	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
this	1
maneuver	1
was	1
a	1
profound	1
one.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
understand	1
just	1
why	1
they	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
maneuver	1
was	1
calculated	1
to	1
save	1
Russia	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
French;	1
for	1
this	1
flank	1
march,	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
preceded,	1
accompanied,	1
or	1
followed	1
by	1
other	1
circumstances,	1
might	1
have	1
proved	1
ruinous	1
to	1
the	1
Russians	1
and	1
salutary	1
for	1
the	1
French.	1
If	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
really	1
began	1
to	1
improve	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
that	1
march,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
follow	1
that	1
the	1
march	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
That	1
flank	1
march	1
might	1
not	1
only	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
advantage	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
but	1
might	1
in	1
other	1
circumstances	1
have	1
led	1
to	1
its	1
destruction.	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
Moscow	1
not	1
burned	1
down?	1
If	1
Murat	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Russians?	1
If	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
not	1
remained	1
inactive?	1
If	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
at	1
Krasnaya	1
Pakhra	1
had	1
given	1
battle	1
as	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
Barclay	1
advised?	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
the	1
French	1
attacked	1
the	1
Russians	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
marching	1
beyond	1
the	1
Pakhra?	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
if	1
on	1
approaching	1
Tarutino,	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
Russians	1
with	1
but	1
a	1
tenth	1
of	1
the	1
energy	1
he	1
had	1
shown	1
when	1
he	1
attacked	1
them	1
at	1
Smolensk?	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
the	1
French	1
moved	1
on	1
Petersburg?...	1
In	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
eventualities	1
the	1
flank	1
march	1
that	1
brought	1
salvation	1
might	1
have	1
proved	1
disastrous.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
and	1
most	1
incomprehensible	1
thing	1
is	1
that	1
people	1
studying	1
history	1
deliberately	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
that	1
this	1
flank	1
march	1
cannot	1
be	1
attributed	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
man,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
ever	1
foresaw	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
reality,	1
like	1
the	1
retreat	1
from	1
Fili,	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
suggest	1
itself	1
to	1
anyone	1
in	1
its	1
entirety,	1
but	1
resulted--moment	1
by	1
moment,	1
step	1
by	1
step,	1
event	1
by	1
event--from	1
an	1
endless	1
number	1
of	1
most	1
diverse	1
circumstances	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
seen	1
in	1
its	1
entirety	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
accomplished	1
and	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
past.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
council	1
at	1
Fili	1
the	1
prevailing	1
thought	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
naturally	1
suggesting	1
itself,	1
namely,	1
a	1
direct	1
retreat	1
by	1
the	1
Nizhni	1
road.	1
In	1
proof	1
of	1
this	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
voted	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
retreat,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
well-known	1
conversation	1
after	1
the	1
council,	1
between	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
and	1
Lanskoy,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
commissariat	1
department.	1
Lanskoy	1
informed	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
supplies	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
stored	1
along	1
the	1
Oka	1
in	1
the	1
Tula	1
and	1
Ryazan	1
provinces,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
retreated	1
on	1
Nizhni	1
the	1
army	1
would	1
be	1
separated	1
from	1
its	1
supplies	1
by	1
the	1
broad	1
river	1
Oka,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
crossed	1
early	1
in	1
winter.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
indication	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
deviating	1
from	1
what	1
had	1
previously	1
seemed	1
the	1
most	1
natural	1
course--a	1
direct	1
retreat	1
on	1
Nizhni-Novgorod.	1
The	1
army	1
turned	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
south,	1
along	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
its	1
supplies.	1
Subsequently	1
the	1
inactivity	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
(who	1
even	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army),	1
concern	1
for	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
arsenal	1
at	1
Tula,	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
its	1
supplies	1
caused	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
turn	1
still	1
further	1
south	1
to	1
the	1
Tula	1
road.	1
Having	1
crossed	1
over,	1
by	1
a	1
forced	1
march,	1
to	1
the	1
Tula	1
road	1
beyond	1
the	1
Pakhra,	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
intended	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
Podolsk	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
Tarutino	1
position;	1
but	1
innumerable	1
circumstances	1
and	1
the	1
reappearance	1
of	1
French	1
troops	1
who	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
lost	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
Russians,	1
and	1
projects	1
of	1
giving	1
battle,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
provisions	1
in	1
Kaluga	1
province,	1
obliged	1
our	1
army	1
to	1
turn	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
to	1
cross	1
from	1
the	1
Tula	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
Tarutino,	1
which	1
was	1
between	1
the	1
roads	1
along	1
which	1
those	1
supplies	1
lay.	1
Just	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
precisely	1
when,	1
or	1
by	1
whom,	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
move	1
to	1
Tarutino.	1
Only	1
when	1
the	1
army	1
had	1
got	1
there,	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
innumerable	1
and	1
varying	1
forces,	1
did	1
people	1
begin	1
to	1
assure	1
themselves	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
desired	1
this	1
movement	1
and	1
long	1
ago	1
foreseen	1
its	1
result.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
The	1
famous	1
flank	1
movement	1
merely	1
consisted	1
in	1
this:	1
after	1
the	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
ceased,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
continually	1
retreating	1
straight	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
invaders,	1
deviated	1
from	1
that	1
direct	1
course	1
and,	1
not	1
finding	1
itself	1
pursued,	1
was	1
naturally	1
drawn	1
toward	1
the	1
district	1
where	1
supplies	1
were	1
abundant.	1
	1
If	1
instead	1
of	1
imagining	1
to	1
ourselves	1
commanders	1
of	1
genius	1
leading	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
we	1
picture	1
that	1
army	1
without	1
any	1
leaders,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
anything	1
but	1
make	1
a	1
return	1
movement	1
toward	1
Moscow,	1
describing	1
an	1
arc	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
where	1
most	1
provisions	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
richest.	1
	1
That	1
movement	1
from	1
the	1
Nizhni	1
to	1
the	1
Ryazan,	1
Tula,	1
and	1
Kaluga	1
roads	1
was	1
so	1
natural	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
Russian	1
marauders	1
moved	1
in	1
that	1
direction,	1
and	1
demands	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
for	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
army	1
that	1
way.	1
At	1
Tarutino	1
Kutuzov	1
received	1
what	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
reprimand	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor	1
for	1
having	1
moved	1
his	1
army	1
along	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
letter	1
indicated	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
very	1
position	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
occupied	1
near	1
Kaluga.	1
	1
Having	1
rolled	1
like	1
a	1
ball	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
impetus	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army--when	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
that	1
impetus	1
was	1
exhausted	1
and	1
no	1
fresh	1
push	1
was	1
received--	1
assumed	1
the	1
position	1
natural	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
merit	1
lay,	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
strategic	1
maneuver	1
of	1
genius,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
called,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
understood	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened.	1
He	1
alone	1
then	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army's	1
inactivity,	1
he	1
alone	1
continued	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
victory,	1
he	1
alone--who	1
as	1
commander-in-chief	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
eager	1
to	1
attack--employed	1
his	1
whole	1
strength	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
from	1
useless	1
engagements.	1
	1
The	1
beast	1
wounded	1
at	1
Borodino	1
was	1
lying	1
where	1
the	1
fleeing	1
hunter	1
had	1
left	1
him;	1
but	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
alive,	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
strong	1
and	1
merely	1
lying	1
low,	1
the	1
hunter	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
moan.	1
	1
The	1
moan	1
of	1
that	1
wounded	1
beast	1
(the	1
French	1
army)	1
which	1
betrayed	1
its	1
calamitous	1
condition	1
was	1
the	1
sending	1
of	1
Lauriston	1
to	1
Kutuzov's	1
camp	1
with	1
overtures	1
for	1
peace.	1
	1
Napoleon,	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
assurance	1
that	1
whatever	1
entered	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
right,	1
wrote	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
that	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
meaningless.	1
	1
MONSIEUR	1
LE	1
PRINCE	1
KOUTOUZOV:	1
I	1
am	1
sending	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
adjutants-general	1
to	1
discuss	1
several	1
interesting	1
questions	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
Highness	1
to	1
credit	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
to	1
you,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
expresses	1
the	1
sentiment	1
of	1
esteem	1
and	1
special	1
regard	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
entertained	1
for	1
your	1
person.	1
This	1
letter	1
having	1
no	1
other	1
object,	1
I	1
pray	1
God,	1
monsieur	1
le	1
Prince	1
Koutouzov,	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
in	1
His	1
holy	1
and	1
gracious	1
protection!	1
	1
NAPOLEON	1
MOSCOW,	1
OCTOBER	1
30,	1
1812	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
replied:	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
cursed	1
by	1
posterity	1
were	1
I	1
looked	1
on	1
as	1
the	1
initiator	1
of	1
a	1
settlement	1
of	1
any	1
sort.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
present	1
spirit	1
of	1
my	1
nation."	1
But	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
exert	1
all	1
his	1
powers	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
troops	1
from	1
attacking.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
month	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
troops	1
were	1
pillaging	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
were	1
quietly	1
encamped	1
at	1
Tarutino,	1
a	1
change	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
relative	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
armies--both	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
number--as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
superiority	1
had	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
side.	1
Though	1
the	1
condition	1
and	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
were	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
Russians,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
that	1
change	1
occurred	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
attacking	1
at	1
once	1
showed	1
itself	1
by	1
countless	1
signs.	1
These	1
signs	1
were:	1
Lauriston's	1
mission;	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
provisions	1
at	1
Tarutino;	1
the	1
reports	1
coming	1
in	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
inactivity	1
and	1
disorder	1
of	1
the	1
French;	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
recruits	1
to	1
our	1
regiments;	1
the	1
fine	1
weather;	1
the	1
long	1
rest	1
the	1
Russian	1
soldiers	1
had	1
enjoyed,	1
and	1
the	1
impatience	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
assembled	1
for,	1
which	1
usually	1
shows	1
itself	1
in	1
an	1
army	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
resting;	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
so	1
long	1
lost	1
sight	1
of,	1
was	1
doing;	1
the	1
boldness	1
with	1
which	1
our	1
outposts	1
now	1
scouted	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
stationed	1
at	1
Tarutino;	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
easy	1
successes	1
gained	1
by	1
peasants	1
and	1
guerrilla	1
troops	1
over	1
the	1
French,	1
the	1
envy	1
aroused	1
by	1
this;	1
the	1
desire	1
for	1
revenge	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
every	1
Russian	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
(above	1
all)	1
a	1
dim	1
consciousness	1
in	1
every	1
soldier's	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
relative	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
had	1
changed	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
advantage	1
was	1
now	1
on	1
our	1
side.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
substantial	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
relative	1
strength,	1
and	1
an	1
advance	1
had	1
become	1
inevitable.	1
And	1
at	1
once,	1
as	1
a	1
clock	1
begins	1
to	1
strike	1
and	1
chime	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
minute	1
hand	1
has	1
completed	1
a	1
full	1
circle,	1
this	1
change	1
was	1
shown	1
by	1
an	1
increased	1
activity,	1
whirring,	1
and	1
chiming	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
spheres.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
commanded	1
by	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
his	1
staff,	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
from	1
Petersburg.	1
Before	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
a	1
detailed	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
up	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
for	1
his	1
guidance.	1
Though	1
this	1
plan	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
our	1
hands,	1
it	1
was	1
approved	1
by	1
the	1
staff	1
and	1
accepted	1
as	1
a	1
basis	1
for	1
action.	1
Kutuzov	1
only	1
replied	1
that	1
movements	1
arranged	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
were	1
always	1
difficult	1
to	1
execute.	1
So	1
fresh	1
instructions	1
were	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
difficulties	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
encountered,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
fresh	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
watch	1
Kutuzov's	1
actions	1
and	1
report	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
Besides	1
this,	1
the	1
whole	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
now	1
reorganized.	1
The	1
posts	1
left	1
vacant	1
by	1
Bagration,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
and	1
by	1
Barclay,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
in	1
dudgeon,	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
filled.	1
Very	1
serious	1
consideration	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
put	1
A	1
in	1
B's	1
place	1
and	1
B	1
in	1
D's,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
put	1
D	1
in	1
A's	1
place,	1
and	1
so	1
on--as	1
if	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
A's	1
or	1
B's	1
satisfaction	1
depended	1
on	1
this.	1
	1
As	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
hostility	1
between	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
Bennigsen,	1
his	1
Chief	1
of	1
Staff,	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
confidential	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
these	1
transfers,	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
complicated	1
play	1
of	1
parties	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
among	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
army.	1
A	1
was	1
undermining	1
B,	1
D	1
was	1
undermining	1
C,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
in	1
all	1
possible	1
combinations	1
and	1
permutations.	1
In	1
all	1
these	1
plottings	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
intrigue	1
was	1
generally	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
war,	1
which	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
believed	1
they	1
were	1
directing;	1
but	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
went	1
on	1
independently	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
go:	1
that	1
is,	1
never	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
people	1
devised,	1
but	1
flowing	1
always	1
from	1
the	1
essential	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
masses.	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spheres	1
did	1
all	1
these	1
schemes,	1
crossings,	1
and	1
interminglings	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
true	1
reflection	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
to	1
happen.	1
	1
Prince	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich!	1
(wrote	1
the	1
Emperor	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
October	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
that	1
reached	1
Kutuzov	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
at	1
Tarutino)	1
Since	1
September	1
2	1
Moscow	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Your	1
last	1
reports	1
were	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
twentieth,	1
and	1
during	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
not	1
only	1
has	1
no	1
action	1
been	1
taken	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
capital,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
last	1
report	1
you	1
have	1
even	1
retreated	1
farther.	1
Serpukhov	1
is	1
already	1
occupied	1
by	1
an	1
enemy	1
detachment	1
and	1
Tula	1
with	1
its	1
famous	1
arsenal	1
so	1
indispensable	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
is	1
in	1
danger.	1
From	1
General	1
Wintzingerode's	1
reports,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
an	1
enemy	1
corps	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
is	1
moving	1
on	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
road.	1
Another	1
corps	1
of	1
several	1
thousand	1
men	1
is	1
moving	1
on	1
Dmitrov.	1
A	1
third	1
has	1
advanced	1
along	1
the	1
Vladimir	1
road,	1
and	1
a	1
fourth,	1
rather	1
considerable	1
detachment	1
is	1
stationed	1
between	1
Ruza	1
and	1
Mozhaysk.	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
as	1
late	1
as	1
the	1
twenty-fifth.	1
In	1
view	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
information,	1
when	1
the	1
enemy	1
has	1
scattered	1
his	1
forces	1
in	1
large	1
detachments,	1
and	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
Guards	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
enemy's	1
forces	1
confronting	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
considerable	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
allow	1
of	1
your	1
taking	1
the	1
offensive?	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
is	1
probably	1
pursuing	1
you	1
with	1
detachments,	1
or	1
at	1
most	1
with	1
an	1
army	1
corps	1
much	1
weaker	1
than	1
the	1
army	1
entrusted	1
to	1
you.	1
It	1
would	1
seem	1
that,	1
availing	1
yourself	1
of	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
you	1
might	1
advantageously	1
attack	1
a	1
weaker	1
one	1
and	1
annihilate	1
him,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
retreat,	1
retaining	1
in	1
our	1
hands	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
provinces	1
now	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
thereby	1
averting	1
danger	1
from	1
Tula	1
and	1
other	1
towns	1
in	1
the	1
interior.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
responsible	1
if	1
the	1
enemy	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
direct	1
a	1
force	1
of	1
any	1
size	1
against	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
threaten	1
this	1
capital	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
possible	1
to	1
retain	1
many	1
troops;	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
entrusted	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
acting	1
with	1
resolution	1
and	1
energy,	1
you	1
have	1
ample	1
means	1
to	1
avert	1
this	1
fresh	1
calamity.	1
Remember	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
still	1
to	1
answer	1
to	1
our	1
offended	1
country	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
You	1
have	1
experienced	1
my	1
readiness	1
to	1
reward	1
you.	1
That	1
readiness	1
will	1
not	1
weaken	1
in	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
and	1
Russia	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
expect	1
from	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
zeal,	1
firmness,	1
and	1
success	1
which	1
your	1
intellect,	1
military	1
talent,	1
and	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
you	1
command	1
justify	1
us	1
in	1
expecting.	1
	1
But	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
this	1
letter,	1
which	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
real	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
itself	1
felt	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
was	1
dispatched,	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
found	1
himself	1
unable	1
any	1
longer	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
commanded	1
from	1
attacking	1
and	1
a	1
battle	1
had	1
taken	1
place.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
October	1
a	1
Cossack,	1
Shapovalov,	1
who	1
was	1
out	1
scouting,	1
killed	1
one	1
hare	1
and	1
wounded	1
another.	1
Following	1
the	1
wounded	1
hare	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
far	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
Murat's	1
army,	1
encamped	1
there	1
without	1
any	1
precautions.	1
The	1
Cossack	1
laughingly	1
told	1
his	1
comrades	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
almost	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
A	1
cornet,	1
hearing	1
the	1
story,	1
informed	1
his	1
commander.	1
	1
The	1
Cossack	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
and	1
questioned.	1
The	1
Cossack	1
officers	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
this	1
chance	1
to	1
capture	1
some	1
horses,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
superior	1
officers,	1
who	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
higher	1
authorities,	1
reported	1
the	1
incident	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
on	1
the	1
staff.	1
The	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
exceedingly	1
strained.	1
Ermolov	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
Bennigsen	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
previously	1
and	1
had	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
influence	1
with	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
to	1
induce	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
offensive.	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
asking	1
for.	1
I	1
need	1
only	1
advise	1
anything	1
and	1
his	1
Highness	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
opposite,"	1
replied	1
Bennigsen.	1
	1
The	1
Cossack's	1
report,	1
confirmed	1
by	1
horse	1
patrols	1
who	1
were	1
sent	1
out,	1
was	1
the	1
final	1
proof	1
that	1
events	1
had	1
matured.	1
The	1
tightly	1
coiled	1
spring	1
was	1
released,	1
the	1
clock	1
began	1
to	1
whirr	1
and	1
the	1
chimes	1
to	1
play.	1
Despite	1
all	1
his	1
supposed	1
power,	1
his	1
intellect,	1
his	1
experience,	1
and	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
men,	1
Kutuzov--having	1
taken	1
into	1
consideration	1
the	1
Cossack's	1
report,	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
Bennigsen	1
who	1
sent	1
personal	1
reports	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
the	1
wishes	1
he	1
supposed	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
hold,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
generals	1
expressed	1
the	1
same	1
wish--could	1
no	1
longer	1
check	1
the	1
inevitable	1
movement,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
useless	1
and	1
harmful--gave	1
his	1
approval,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
the	1
accomplished	1
fact.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Bennigsen's	1
note	1
and	1
the	1
Cossack's	1
information	1
that	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
unguarded	1
were	1
merely	1
final	1
indications	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
order	1
an	1
attack,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
fifth	1
of	1
October.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
of	1
October	1
Kutuzov	1
signed	1
the	1
dispositions.	1
Toll	1
read	1
them	1
to	1
Ermolov,	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
further	1
arrangements.	1
	1
"All	1
right--all	1
right.	1
I	1
haven't	1
time	1
just	1
now,"	1
replied	1
Ermolov,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
hut.	1
	1
The	1
dispositions	1
drawn	1
up	1
by	1
Toll	1
were	1
very	1
good.	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
Austerlitz	1
dispositions,	1
it	1
was	1
written--though	1
not	1
in	1
German	1
this	1
time:	1
	1
"The	1
First	1
Column	1
will	1
march	1
here	1
and	1
here,"	1
"the	1
Second	1
Column	1
will	1
march	1
there	1
and	1
there,"	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
and	1
on	1
paper,	1
all	1
these	1
columns	1
arrived	1
at	1
their	1
places	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
time	1
and	1
destroyed	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Everything	1
had	1
been	1
admirably	1
thought	1
out	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
dispositions,	1
and	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case,	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
column	1
reached	1
its	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
time.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
necessary	1
number	1
of	1
copies	1
of	1
the	1
dispositions	1
had	1
been	1
prepared,	1
an	1
officer	1
was	1
summoned	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
Ermolov	1
to	1
deal	1
with.	1
A	1
young	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
Kutuzov's	1
orderly,	1
pleased	1
at	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
mission	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
went	1
to	1
Ermolov's	1
quarters.	1
	1
"Gone	1
away,"	1
said	1
Ermolov's	1
orderly.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
with	1
whom	1
Ermolov	1
was	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
"No,	1
and	1
the	1
general's	1
out	1
too."	1
	1
The	1
officer,	1
mounting	1
his	1
horse,	1
rode	1
off	1
to	1
someone	1
else.	1
	1
"No,	1
he's	1
gone	1
out."	1
	1
"If	1
only	1
they	1
don't	1
make	1
me	1
responsible	1
for	1
this	1
delay!	1
What	1
a	1
nuisance	1
it	1
is!"	1
thought	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
round	1
the	1
whole	1
camp.	1
One	1
man	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Ermolov	1
ride	1
past	1
with	1
some	1
other	1
generals,	1
others	1
said	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
returned	1
home.	1
The	1
officer	1
searched	1
till	1
six	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
without	1
even	1
stopping	1
to	1
eat.	1
Ermolov	1
was	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
The	1
officer	1
snatched	1
a	1
little	1
food	1
at	1
a	1
comrade's,	1
and	1
rode	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
vanguard	1
to	1
find	1
Miloradovich.	1
Miloradovich	1
too	1
was	1
away,	1
but	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
ball	1
at	1
General	1
Kikin's	1
and	1
that	1
Ermolov	1
was	1
probably	1
there	1
too.	1
	1
"But	1
where	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
there,	1
over	1
at	1
Echkino,"	1
said	1
a	1
Cossack	1
officer,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
country	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
far	1
distance.	1
	1
"What,	1
outside	1
our	1
line?"	1
	1
"They've	1
put	1
two	1
regiments	1
as	1
outposts,	1
and	1
they're	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
spree	1
there,	1
it's	1
awful!	1
Two	1
bands	1
and	1
three	1
sets	1
of	1
singers!"	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
rode	1
out	1
beyond	1
our	1
lines	1
to	1
Echkino.	1
While	1
still	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
he	1
heard	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
the	1
merry	1
sounds	1
of	1
a	1
soldier's	1
dance	1
song	1
proceeding	1
from	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
meadows...	1
in	1
the	1
meadows!"	1
he	1
heard,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
whistling	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
torban,	1
drowned	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
by	1
shouts.	1
These	1
sounds	1
made	1
his	1
spirits	1
rise,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
blamed	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
executed	1
sooner	1
the	1
important	1
order	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
past	1
eight	1
o'clock.	1
He	1
dismounted	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
country	1
house	1
which	1
had	1
remained	1
intact	1
between	1
the	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
forces.	1
In	1
the	1
refreshment	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
hall,	1
footmen	1
were	1
bustling	1
about	1
with	1
wine	1
and	1
viands.	1
Groups	1
of	1
singers	1
stood	1
outside	1
the	1
windows.	1
The	1
officer	1
was	1
admitted	1
and	1
immediately	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
generals	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
together,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
Ermolov's	1
big	1
imposing	1
figure.	1
They	1
all	1
had	1
their	1
coats	1
unbuttoned	1
and	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle	1
with	1
flushed	1
and	1
animated	1
faces,	1
laughing	1
loudly.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
short	1
handsome	1
general	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face	1
was	1
dancing	1
the	1
trepak	1
with	1
much	1
spirit	1
and	1
agility.	1
	1
"Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!	1
Bravo,	1
Nicholas	1
Ivanych!	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!"	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
felt	1
that	1
by	1
arriving	1
with	1
important	1
orders	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
doubly	1
to	1
blame,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
preferred	1
to	1
wait;	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
espied	1
him	1
and,	1
hearing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
about,	1
informed	1
Ermolov.	1
	1
Ermolov	1
came	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and,	1
hearing	1
what	1
the	1
officer	1
had	1
to	1
say,	1
took	1
the	1
papers	1
from	1
him	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
just	1
by	1
chance?"	1
said	1
a	1
comrade,	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
that	1
evening,	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
referring	1
to	1
Ermolov.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
trick.	1
It	1
was	1
done	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
get	1
Konovnitsyn	1
into	1
trouble.	1
You'll	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
mess	1
there'll	1
be	1
tomorrow."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
decrepit	1
Kutuzov,	1
having	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
early,	1
said	1
his	1
prayers,	1
dressed,	1
and,	1
with	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
consciousness	1
of	1
having	1
to	1
direct	1
a	1
battle	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of,	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
caleche	1
and	1
drove	1
from	1
Letashovka	1
(a	1
village	1
three	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
miles	1
from	1
Tarutino)	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
attacking	1
columns	1
were	1
to	1
meet.	1
He	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
caleche,	1
dozing	1
and	1
waking	1
up	1
by	1
turns,	1
and	1
listening	1
for	1
any	1
sound	1
of	1
firing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
as	1
an	1
indication	1
that	1
the	1
action	1
had	1
begun.	1
But	1
all	1
was	1
still	1
quiet.	1
A	1
damp	1
dull	1
autumn	1
morning	1
was	1
just	1
dawning.	1
On	1
approaching	1
Tarutino	1
Kutuzov	1
noticed	1
cavalrymen	1
leading	1
their	1
horses	1
to	1
water	1
across	1
the	1
road	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
driving.	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
searchingly,	1
stopped	1
his	1
carriage,	1
and	1
inquired	1
what	1
regiment	1
they	1
belonged	1
to.	1
They	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
column	1
that	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
far	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
in	1
ambush	1
long	1
before	1
then.	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
mistake,"	1
thought	1
the	1
old	1
commander-in-chief.	1
But	1
a	1
little	1
further	1
on	1
he	1
saw	1
infantry	1
regiments	1
with	1
their	1
arms	1
piled	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
only	1
partly	1
dressed,	1
eating	1
their	1
rye	1
porridge	1
and	1
carrying	1
fuel.	1
He	1
sent	1
for	1
an	1
officer.	1
The	1
officer	1
reported	1
that	1
no	1
order	1
to	1
advance	1
had	1
been	1
received.	1
	1
"How!	1
Not	1
rec..."	1
Kutuzov	1
began,	1
but	1
checked	1
himself	1
immediately	1
and	1
sent	1
for	1
a	1
senior	1
officer.	1
Getting	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
caleche,	1
he	1
waited	1
with	1
drooping	1
head	1
and	1
breathing	1
heavily,	1
pacing	1
silently	1
up	1
and	1
down.	1
When	1
Eykhen,	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
staff	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
summoned,	1
appeared,	1
Kutuzov	1
went	1
purple	1
in	1
the	1
face,	1
not	1
because	1
that	1
officer	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
the	1
mistake,	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
sufficient	1
importance	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
vent	1
his	1
wrath	1
on.	1
Trembling	1
and	1
panting	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
fell	1
into	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
fury	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
sometimes	1
used	1
to	1
roll	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
Eykhen,	1
threatening	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
shouting	1
and	1
loading	1
him	1
with	1
gross	1
abuse.	1
Another	1
man,	1
Captain	1
Brozin,	1
who	1
happened	1
to	1
turn	1
up	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
blame,	1
suffered	1
the	1
same	1
fate.	1
	1
"What	1
sort	1
of	1
another	1
blackguard	1
are	1
you?	1
I'll	1
have	1
you	1
shot!	1
Scoundrels!"	1
yelled	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice,	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
reeling.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
suffering	1
physically.	1
He,	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
a	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
who	1
everybody	1
said	1
possessed	1
powers	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
man	1
had	1
ever	1
had	1
in	1
Russia,	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
this	1
position--made	1
the	1
laughingstock	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army!	1
"I	1
needn't	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
pray	1
about	1
today,	1
or	1
have	1
kept	1
awake	1
thinking	1
everything	1
over	1
all	1
night,"	1
thought	1
he	1
to	1
himself.	1
"When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
chit	1
of	1
an	1
officer	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
mock	1
me	1
so...	1
and	1
now!"	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
physical	1
suffering	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
corporal	1
punishment,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
avoid	1
expressing	1
it	1
by	1
cries	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
distress.	1
But	1
his	1
strength	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
fail	1
him,	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
him,	1
conscious	1
of	1
having	1
said	1
much	1
that	1
was	1
amiss,	1
he	1
again	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
caleche	1
and	1
drove	1
back	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
His	1
wrath,	1
once	1
expended,	1
did	1
not	1
return,	1
and	1
blinking	1
feebly	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
excuses	1
and	1
self-justifications	1
(Ermolov	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
till	1
the	1
next	1
day)	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
insistence	1
of	1
Bennigsen,	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
and	1
Toll	1
that	1
the	1
movement	1
that	1
had	1
miscarried	1
should	1
be	1
executed	1
next	1
day.	1
And	1
once	1
more	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
to	1
consent.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
troops	1
assembled	1
in	1
their	1
appointed	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
advanced	1
during	1
the	1
night.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
autumn	1
night	1
with	1
dark	1
purple	1
clouds,	1
but	1
no	1
rain.	1
The	1
ground	1
was	1
damp	1
but	1
not	1
muddy,	1
and	1
the	1
troops	1
advanced	1
noiselessly,	1
only	1
occasionally	1
a	1
jingling	1
of	1
the	1
artillery	1
could	1
be	1
faintly	1
heard.	1
The	1
men	1
were	1
forbidden	1
to	1
talk	1
out	1
loud,	1
to	1
smoke	1
their	1
pipes,	1
or	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
light,	1
and	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
prevent	1
their	1
horses	1
neighing.	1
The	1
secrecy	1
of	1
the	1
undertaking	1
heightened	1
its	1
charm	1
and	1
they	1
marched	1
gaily.	1
Some	1
columns,	1
supposing	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
their	1
destination,	1
halted,	1
piled	1
arms,	1
and	1
settled	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
cold	1
ground,	1
but	1
the	1
majority	1
marched	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
arrived	1
at	1
places	1
where	1
they	1
evidently	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been.	1
	1
Only	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
Cossacks	1
(the	1
least	1
important	1
detachment	1
of	1
all)	1
got	1
to	1
his	1
appointed	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time.	1
This	1
detachment	1
halted	1
at	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
a	1
forest,	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
leading	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Stromilova	1
to	1
Dmitrovsk.	1
	1
Toward	1
dawn,	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
dozed	1
off,	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
a	1
deserter	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
being	1
brought	1
to	1
him.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
Polish	1
sergeant	1
of	1
Poniatowski's	1
corps,	1
who	1
explained	1
in	1
Polish	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
slighted	1
in	1
the	1
service:	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
an	1
officer,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
braver	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
them	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
pay	1
them	1
out.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
Murat	1
was	1
spending	1
the	1
night	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
where	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
men	1
he	1
would	1
capture	1
him	1
alive.	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov	1
consulted	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers.	1
	1
The	1
offer	1
was	1
too	1
tempting	1
to	1
be	1
refused.	1
Everyone	1
volunteered	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
everybody	1
advised	1
making	1
the	1
attempt.	1
After	1
much	1
disputing	1
and	1
arguing,	1
Major-General	1
Grekov	1
with	1
two	1
Cossack	1
regiments	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
Polish	1
sergeant.	1
	1
"Now,	1
remember,"	1
said	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov	1
to	1
the	1
sergeant	1
at	1
parting,	1
"if	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
lying	1
I'll	1
have	1
you	1
hanged	1
like	1
a	1
dog;	1
but	1
if	1
it's	1
true	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
hundred	1
gold	1
pieces!"	1
	1
Without	1
replying,	1
the	1
sergeant,	1
with	1
a	1
resolute	1
air,	1
mounted	1
and	1
rode	1
away	1
with	1
Grekov	1
whose	1
men	1
had	1
quickly	1
assembled.	1
They	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov,	1
having	1
seen	1
Grekov	1
off,	1
returned,	1
shivering	1
from	1
the	1
freshness	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
dawn	1
and	1
excited	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
undertaken	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
responsibility,	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
enemy	1
camp,	1
now	1
just	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
deceptive	1
light	1
of	1
dawn	1
and	1
the	1
dying	1
campfires.	1
Our	1
columns	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
appear	1
on	1
an	1
open	1
declivity	1
to	1
his	1
right.	1
He	1
looked	1
in	1
that	1
direction,	1
but	1
though	1
the	1
columns	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
visible	1
quite	1
far	1
off,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
French	1
camp,	1
and	1
his	1
keen-sighted	1
adjutant	1
confirmed	1
this.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
too	1
late,"	1
said	1
Count	1
Orlov,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
As	1
often	1
happens	1
when	1
someone	1
we	1
have	1
trusted	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
before	1
our	1
eyes,	1
it	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
quite	1
clear	1
and	1
obvious	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
sergeant	1
was	1
an	1
impostor,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lied,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
attack	1
would	1
be	1
ruined	1
by	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
those	1
two	1
regiments,	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
lead	1
away	1
heaven	1
only	1
knew	1
where.	1
How	1
could	1
one	1
capture	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
from	1
among	1
such	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
troops!	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
rascal	1
was	1
lying,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"They	1
can	1
still	1
be	1
called	1
back,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
suite,	1
who	1
like	1
Count	1
Orlov	1
felt	1
distrustful	1
of	1
the	1
adventure	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
enemy's	1
camp.	1
	1
"Eh?	1
Really...	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
Should	1
we	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
on	1
or	1
not?"	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
have	1
them	1
fetched	1
back?"	1
	1
"Fetch	1
them	1
back,	1
fetch	1
them	1
back!"	1
said	1
Count	1
Orlov	1
with	1
sudden	1
determination,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
"It	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
late.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
light."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
adjutant	1
galloped	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
after	1
Grekov.	1
When	1
Grekov	1
returned,	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov,	1
excited	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
abandoned	1
attempt	1
and	1
by	1
vainly	1
awaiting	1
the	1
infantry	1
columns	1
that	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
appear,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
proximity	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
resolved	1
to	1
advance.	1
All	1
his	1
men	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
excitement.	1
	1
"Mount!"	1
he	1
commanded	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
The	1
men	1
took	1
their	1
places	1
and	1
crossed	1
themselves....	1
"Forward,	1
with	1
God's	1
aid!"	1
	1
"Hurrah-ah-ah!"	1
reverberated	1
in	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
the	1
Cossack	1
companies,	1
trailing	1
their	1
lances	1
and	1
advancing	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
as	1
if	1
poured	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
sack,	1
dashed	1
gaily	1
across	1
the	1
brook	1
toward	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
One	1
desperate,	1
frightened	1
yell	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
French	1
soldier	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
Cossacks,	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
camp,	1
undressed	1
and	1
only	1
just	1
waking	1
up,	1
ran	1
off	1
in	1
all	1
directions,	1
abandoning	1
cannons,	1
muskets,	1
and	1
horses.	1
	1
Had	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
pursued	1
the	1
French,	1
without	1
heeding	1
what	1
was	1
behind	1
and	1
around	1
them,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
captured	1
Murat	1
and	1
everything	1
there.	1
That	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
officers	1
desired.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
budge	1
when	1
once	1
they	1
had	1
got	1
booty	1
and	1
prisoners.	1
None	1
of	1
them	1
listened	1
to	1
orders.	1
Fifteen	1
hundred	1
prisoners	1
and	1
thirty-eight	1
guns	1
were	1
taken	1
on	1
the	1
spot,	1
besides	1
standards	1
and	1
(what	1
seemed	1
most	1
important	1
to	1
the	1
Cossacks)	1
horses,	1
saddles,	1
horsecloths,	1
and	1
the	1
like.	1
All	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
dealt	1
with,	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
guns	1
secured,	1
the	1
booty	1
divided--not	1
without	1
some	1
shouting	1
and	1
even	1
a	1
little	1
fighting	1
among	1
themselves--and	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
all	1
busied	1
themselves.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
not	1
being	1
farther	1
pursued,	1
began	1
to	1
recover	1
themselves:	1
they	1
formed	1
into	1
detachments	1
and	1
began	1
firing.	1
Orlov-Denisov,	1
still	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
columns	1
to	1
arrive,	1
advanced	1
no	1
further.	1
	1
Meantime,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
dispositions	1
which	1
said	1
that	1
"the	1
First	1
Column	1
will	1
march"	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
the	1
infantry	1
of	1
the	1
belated	1
columns,	1
commanded	1
by	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
directed	1
by	1
Toll,	1
had	1
started	1
in	1
due	1
order	1
and,	1
as	1
always	1
happens,	1
had	1
got	1
somewhere,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
their	1
appointed	1
places.	1
As	1
always	1
happens	1
the	1
men,	1
starting	1
cheerfully,	1
began	1
to	1
halt;	1
murmurs	1
were	1
heard,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
confusion,	1
and	1
finally	1
a	1
backward	1
movement.	1
Adjutants	1
and	1
generals	1
galloped	1
about,	1
shouted,	1
grew	1
angry,	1
quarreled,	1
said	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
quite	1
wrong	1
and	1
were	1
late,	1
gave	1
vent	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
abuse,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
gave	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
forward,	1
simply	1
to	1
get	1
somewhere.	1
"We	1
shall	1
get	1
somewhere	1
or	1
other!"	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
indeed	1
get	1
somewhere,	1
though	1
not	1
to	1
their	1
right	1
places;	1
a	1
few	1
eventually	1
even	1
got	1
to	1
their	1
right	1
place,	1
but	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use	1
and	1
only	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
fired	1
at.	1
Toll,	1
who	1
in	1
this	1
battle	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
Weyrother	1
at	1
Austerlitz,	1
galloped	1
assiduously	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place,	1
finding	1
everything	1
upside	1
down	1
everywhere.	1
Thus	1
he	1
stumbled	1
on	1
Bagovut's	1
corps	1
in	1
a	1
wood	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
broad	1
daylight,	1
though	1
the	1
corps	1
should	1
long	1
before	1
have	1
joined	1
Orlov-Denisov.	1
Excited	1
and	1
vexed	1
by	1
the	1
failure	1
and	1
supposing	1
that	1
someone	1
must	1
be	1
responsible	1
for	1
it,	1
Toll	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
corps	1
and	1
began	1
upbraiding	1
him	1
severely,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
shot.	1
General	1
Bagovut,	1
a	1
fighting	1
old	1
soldier	1
of	1
placid	1
temperament,	1
being	1
also	1
upset	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
delay,	1
confusion,	1
and	1
cross-purposes,	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
rage	1
to	1
everybody's	1
surprise	1
and	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
character	1
and	1
said	1
disagreeable	1
things	1
to	1
Toll.	1
	1
"I	1
prefer	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
lessons	1
from	1
anyone,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
die	1
with	1
my	1
men	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
anybody,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
advanced	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
division.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
onto	1
a	1
field	1
under	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fire,	1
this	1
brave	1
general	1
went	1
straight	1
ahead,	1
leading	1
his	1
men	1
under	1
fire,	1
without	1
considering	1
in	1
his	1
agitation	1
whether	1
going	1
into	1
action	1
now,	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
division,	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use	1
or	1
no.	1
Danger,	1
cannon	1
balls,	1
and	1
bullets	1
were	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
needed	1
in	1
his	1
angry	1
mood.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
bullets	1
killed	1
him,	1
and	1
other	1
bullets	1
killed	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
men.	1
And	1
his	1
division	1
remained	1
under	1
fire	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
quite	1
uselessly.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
another	1
column	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
attacked	1
the	1
French	1
from	1
the	1
front,	1
but	1
Kutuzov	1
accompanied	1
that	1
column.	1
He	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
confusion	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
this	1
battle	1
undertaken	1
against	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
held	1
the	1
troops	1
back.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
advance.	1
	1
He	1
rode	1
silently	1
on	1
his	1
small	1
gray	1
horse,	1
indolently	1
answering	1
suggestions	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
attack.	1
	1
"The	1
word	1
attack	1
is	1
always	1
on	1
your	1
tongue,	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
unable	1
to	1
execute	1
complicated	1
maneuvers,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Miloradovich	1
who	1
asked	1
permission	1
to	1
advance.	1
	1
"We	1
couldn't	1
take	1
Murat	1
prisoner	1
this	1
morning	1
or	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
in	1
time,	1
and	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
now!"	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
someone	1
else.	1
	1
When	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
rear--where	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
there	1
had	1
previously	1
been	1
nobody--there	1
were	1
now	1
two	1
battalions	1
of	1
Poles,	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
sidelong	1
glance	1
at	1
Ermolov	1
who	1
was	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
spoken	1
since	1
the	1
previous	1
day.	1
	1
"You	1
see!	1
They	1
are	1
asking	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
making	1
plans	1
of	1
all	1
kinds,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
one	1
gets	1
to	1
business	1
nothing	1
is	1
ready,	1
and	1
the	1
enemy,	1
forewarned,	1
takes	1
measures	1
accordingly."	1
	1
Ermolov	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
smiled	1
faintly	1
on	1
hearing	1
these	1
words.	1
He	1
understood	1
that	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
storm	1
had	1
blown	1
over,	1
and	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
would	1
content	1
himself	1
with	1
that	1
hint.	1
	1
"He's	1
having	1
a	1
little	1
fun	1
at	1
my	1
expense,"	1
said	1
Ermolov	1
softly,	1
nudging	1
with	1
his	1
knee	1
Raevski	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
this,	1
Ermolov	1
moved	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
respectfully	1
remarked:	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
yet,	1
your	1
Highness--the	1
enemy	1
has	1
not	1
gone	1
away--if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
order	1
an	1
attack!	1
If	1
not,	1
the	1
Guards	1
will	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
see	1
a	1
little	1
smoke."	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
reported	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Murat's	1
troops	1
were	1
in	1
retreat	1
he	1
ordered	1
an	1
advance,	1
though	1
at	1
every	1
hundred	1
paces	1
he	1
halted	1
for	1
three	1
quarters	1
of	1
an	1
hour.	1
	1
The	1
whole	1
battle	1
consisted	1
in	1
what	1
Orlov-Denisov's	1
Cossacks	1
had	1
done:	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
merely	1
lost	1
some	1
hundreds	1
of	1
men	1
uselessly.	1
	1
In	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
battle	1
Kutuzov	1
received	1
a	1
diamond	1
decoration,	1
and	1
Bennigsen	1
some	1
diamonds	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rubles,	1
others	1
also	1
received	1
pleasant	1
recognitions	1
corresponding	1
to	1
their	1
various	1
grades,	1
and	1
following	1
the	1
battle	1
fresh	1
changes	1
were	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
staff.	1
	1
"That's	1
how	1
everything	1
is	1
done	1
with	1
us,	1
all	1
topsy-turvy!"	1
said	1
the	1
Russian	1
officers	1
and	1
generals	1
after	1
the	1
Tarutino	1
battle,	1
letting	1
it	1
be	1
understood	1
that	1
some	1
fool	1
there	1
is	1
doing	1
things	1
all	1
wrong	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
ourselves	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
so,	1
just	1
as	1
people	1
speak	1
today.	1
But	1
people	1
who	1
talk	1
like	1
that	1
either	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
or	1
deliberately	1
deceive	1
themselves.	1
No	1
battle--Tarutino,	1
Borodino,	1
or	1
Austerlitz--takes	1
place	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
planned	1
it	1
anticipated.	1
That	1
is	1
an	1
essential	1
condition.	1
	1
A	1
countless	1
number	1
of	1
free	1
forces	1
(for	1
nowhere	1
is	1
man	1
freer	1
than	1
during	1
a	1
battle,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death)	1
influence	1
the	1
course	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
fight,	1
and	1
that	1
course	1
never	1
can	1
be	1
known	1
in	1
advance	1
and	1
never	1
coincides	1
with	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
force.	1
	1
If	1
many	1
simultaneously	1
and	1
variously	1
directed	1
forces	1
act	1
on	1
a	1
given	1
body,	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
its	1
motion	1
cannot	1
coincide	1
with	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
forces,	1
but	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
a	1
mean--what	1
in	1
mechanics	1
is	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
diagonal	1
of	1
a	1
parallelogram	1
of	1
forces.	1
	1
If	1
in	1
the	1
descriptions	1
given	1
by	1
historians,	1
especially	1
French	1
ones,	1
we	1
find	1
their	1
wars	1
and	1
battles	1
carried	1
out	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
previously	1
formed	1
plans,	1
the	1
only	1
conclusion	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
is	1
that	1
those	1
descriptions	1
are	1
false.	1
	1
The	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino	1
obviously	1
did	1
not	1
attain	1
the	1
aim	1
Toll	1
had	1
in	1
view--to	1
lead	1
the	1
troops	1
into	1
action	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
prescribed	1
by	1
the	1
dispositions;	1
nor	1
that	1
which	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov	1
may	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
view--	1
to	1
take	1
Murat	1
prisoner;	1
nor	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
immediately	1
destroying	1
the	1
whole	1
corps,	1
which	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
others	1
may	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
view;	1
nor	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
officer	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
action	1
to	1
distinguish	1
himself;	1
nor	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Cossack	1
who	1
wanted	1
more	1
booty	1
than	1
he	1
got,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
what	1
actually	1
resulted	1
and	1
what	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
desired--to	1
drive	1
the	1
French	1
out	1
of	1
Russia	1
and	1
destroy	1
their	1
army--it	1
is	1
quite	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino,	1
just	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
incongruities,	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
was	1
wanted	1
at	1
that	1
stage	1
of	1
the	1
campaign.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
and	1
even	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
result	1
more	1
opportune	1
than	1
the	1
actual	1
outcome	1
of	1
this	1
battle.	1
With	1
a	1
minimum	1
of	1
effort	1
and	1
insignificant	1
losses,	1
despite	1
the	1
greatest	1
confusion,	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
were	1
attained:	1
the	1
transition	1
from	1
retreat	1
to	1
advance,	1
an	1
exposure	1
of	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
that	1
shock	1
which	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
had	1
only	1
awaited	1
to	1
begin	1
its	1
flight.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
Napoleon	1
enters	1
Moscow	1
after	1
the	1
brilliant	1
victory	1
de	1
la	1
Moskowa;	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
the	1
victory	1
for	1
the	1
battlefield	1
remains	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
The	1
Russians	1
retreat	1
and	1
abandon	1
their	1
ancient	1
capital.	1
Moscow,	1
abounding	1
in	1
provisions,	1
arms,	1
munitions,	1
and	1
incalculable	1
wealth,	1
is	1
in	1
Napoleon's	1
hands.	1
The	1
Russian	1
army,	1
only	1
half	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
does	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
single	1
attempt	1
to	1
attack	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
month.	1
Napoleon's	1
position	1
is	1
most	1
brilliant.	1
He	1
can	1
either	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
with	1
double	1
its	1
strength	1
and	1
destroy	1
it;	1
negotiate	1
an	1
advantageous	1
peace,	1
or	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
refusal	1
make	1
a	1
menacing	1
move	1
on	1
Petersburg,	1
or	1
even,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
reverse,	1
return	1
to	1
Smolensk	1
or	1
Vilna;	1
or	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow;	1
in	1
short,	1
no	1
special	1
genius	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
required	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
brilliant	1
position	1
the	1
French	1
held	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
For	1
that,	1
only	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
steps	1
were	1
necessary:	1
not	1
to	1
allow	1
the	1
troops	1
to	1
loot,	1
to	1
prepare	1
winter	1
clothing--of	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
sufficient	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
army--and	1
methodically	1
to	1
collect	1
the	1
provisions,	1
of	1
which	1
(according	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
historians)	1
there	1
were	1
enough	1
in	1
Moscow	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
for	1
six	1
months.	1
Yet	1
Napoleon,	1
that	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
geniuses,	1
who	1
the	1
historians	1
declare	1
had	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
took	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
steps.	1
	1
He	1
not	1
merely	1
did	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
used	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
select	1
the	1
most	1
foolish	1
and	1
ruinous	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
courses	1
open	1
to	1
him.	1
Of	1
all	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
might	1
have	1
done:	1
wintering	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
advancing	1
on	1
Petersburg	1
or	1
on	1
Nizhni-Novgorod,	1
or	1
retiring	1
by	1
a	1
more	1
northerly	1
or	1
more	1
southerly	1
route	1
(say	1
by	1
the	1
road	1
Kutuzov	1
afterwards	1
took),	1
nothing	1
more	1
stupid	1
or	1
disastrous	1
can	1
be	1
imagined	1
than	1
what	1
he	1
actually	1
did.	1
He	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
till	1
October,	1
letting	1
the	1
troops	1
plunder	1
the	1
city;	1
then,	1
hesitating	1
whether	1
to	1
leave	1
a	1
garrison	1
behind	1
him,	1
he	1
quitted	1
Moscow,	1
approached	1
Kutuzov	1
without	1
joining	1
battle,	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
reached	1
Malo-Yaroslavets,	1
again	1
without	1
attempting	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
road	1
Kutuzov	1
took,	1
but	1
retiring	1
instead	1
to	1
Mozhaysk	1
along	1
the	1
devastated	1
Smolensk	1
road.	1
Nothing	1
more	1
stupid	1
than	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
devised,	1
or	1
more	1
disastrous	1
for	1
the	1
army,	1
as	1
the	1
sequel	1
showed.	1
Had	1
Napoleon's	1
aim	1
been	1
to	1
destroy	1
his	1
army,	1
the	1
most	1
skillful	1
strategist	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
devised	1
any	1
series	1
of	1
actions	1
that	1
would	1
so	1
completely	1
have	1
accomplished	1
that	1
purpose,	1
independently	1
of	1
anything	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
might	1
do.	1
	1
Napoleon,	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
genius,	1
did	1
this!	1
But	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
destroyed	1
his	1
army	1
because	1
he	1
wished	1
to,	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
stupid,	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
unjust	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
his	1
troops	1
to	1
Moscow	1
because	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
clever	1
and	1
a	1
genius.	1
	1
In	1
both	1
cases	1
his	1
personal	1
activity,	1
having	1
no	1
more	1
force	1
than	1
the	1
personal	1
activity	1
of	1
any	1
soldier,	1
merely	1
coincided	1
with	1
the	1
laws	1
that	1
guided	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
The	1
historians	1
quite	1
falsely	1
represent	1
Napoleon's	1
faculties	1
as	1
having	1
weakened	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
do	1
so	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
results	1
did	1
not	1
justify	1
his	1
actions.	1
He	1
employed	1
all	1
his	1
ability	1
and	1
strength	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
army,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
previously	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
subsequently	1
in	1
1813.	1
His	1
activity	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
astounding	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
Italy,	1
in	1
Austria,	1
and	1
in	1
Prussia.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
his	1
genius	1
was	1
genuine	1
in	1
Egypt--where	1
forty	1
centuries	1
looked	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
grandeur--for	1
his	1
great	1
exploits	1
there	1
are	1
all	1
told	1
us	1
by	1
Frenchmen.	1
We	1
cannot	1
accurately	1
estimate	1
his	1
genius	1
in	1
Austria	1
or	1
Prussia,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
draw	1
our	1
information	1
from	1
French	1
or	1
German	1
sources,	1
and	1
the	1
incomprehensible	1
surrender	1
of	1
whole	1
corps	1
without	1
fighting	1
and	1
of	1
fortresses	1
without	1
a	1
siege	1
must	1
incline	1
Germans	1
to	1
recognize	1
his	1
genius	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
Germany.	1
But	1
we,	1
thank	1
God,	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
recognize	1
his	1
genius	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
hide	1
our	1
shame.	1
We	1
have	1
paid	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
plainly	1
and	1
simply,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
abandon	1
that	1
right.	1
	1
His	1
activity	1
in	1
Moscow	1
was	1
as	1
amazing	1
and	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
genius	1
as	1
elsewhere.	1
Order	1
after	1
order	1
and	1
plan	1
after	1
plan	1
were	1
issued	1
by	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
entered	1
Moscow	1
till	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
left	1
it.	1
The	1
absence	1
of	1
citizens	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
deputation,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
did	1
not	1
disconcert	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
sight	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Russia,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
affairs	1
in	1
Paris,	1
or	1
of	1
diplomatic	1
considerations	1
concerning	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
anticipated	1
peace.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
military	1
matters,	1
Napoleon	1
immediately	1
on	1
his	1
entry	1
into	1
Moscow	1
gave	1
General	1
Sabastiani	1
strict	1
orders	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
sent	1
army	1
corps	1
out	1
along	1
the	1
different	1
roads,	1
and	1
charged	1
Murat	1
to	1
find	1
Kutuzov.	1
Then	1
he	1
gave	1
careful	1
directions	1
about	1
the	1
fortification	1
of	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
brilliant	1
plan	1
for	1
a	1
future	1
campaign	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
map	1
of	1
Russia.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
diplomatic	1
questions,	1
Napoleon	1
summoned	1
Captain	1
Yakovlev,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
robbed	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
rags	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
minutely	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
whole	1
policy	1
and	1
his	1
magnanimity,	1
and	1
having	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
inform	1
his	1
Friend	1
and	1
Brother	1
that	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
managed	1
affairs	1
badly	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
dispatched	1
Yakovlev	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
Having	1
similarly	1
explained	1
his	1
views	1
and	1
his	1
magnanimity	1
to	1
Tutolmin,	1
he	1
dispatched	1
that	1
old	1
man	1
also	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
negotiate.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
legal	1
matters,	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
fires	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
find	1
and	1
execute	1
the	1
incendiaries.	1
And	1
the	1
scoundrel	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
punished	1
by	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
burn	1
down	1
his	1
houses.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
administrative	1
matters,	1
Moscow	1
was	1
granted	1
a	1
constitution.	1
A	1
municipality	1
was	1
established	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
announcement	1
issued:	1
	1
INHABITANTS	1
OF	1
MOSCOW!	1
	1
Your	1
misfortunes	1
are	1
cruel,	1
but	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
King	1
desires	1
to	1
arrest	1
their	1
course.	1
Terrible	1
examples	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
how	1
he	1
punishes	1
disobedience	1
and	1
crime.	1
Strict	1
measures	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
disorder	1
and	1
to	1
re-establish	1
public	1
security.	1
A	1
paternal	1
administration,	1
chosen	1
from	1
among	1
yourselves,	1
will	1
form	1
your	1
municipality	1
or	1
city	1
government.	1
It	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
you,	1
of	1
your	1
needs,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
welfare.	1
Its	1
members	1
will	1
be	1
distinguished	1
by	1
a	1
red	1
ribbon	1
worn	1
across	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
the	1
mayor	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
will	1
wear	1
a	1
white	1
belt	1
as	1
well.	1
But	1
when	1
not	1
on	1
duty	1
they	1
will	1
only	1
wear	1
a	1
red	1
ribbon	1
round	1
the	1
left	1
arm.	1
	1
The	1
city	1
police	1
is	1
established	1
on	1
its	1
former	1
footing,	1
and	1
better	1
order	1
already	1
prevails	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
its	1
activity.	1
The	1
government	1
has	1
appointed	1
two	1
commissaries	1
general,	1
or	1
chiefs	1
of	1
police,	1
and	1
twenty	1
commissaries	1
or	1
captains	1
of	1
wards	1
have	1
been	1
appointed	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
wards	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
You	1
will	1
recognize	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
white	1
ribbon	1
they	1
will	1
wear	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
arm.	1
Several	1
churches	1
of	1
different	1
denominations	1
are	1
open,	1
and	1
divine	1
service	1
is	1
performed	1
in	1
them	1
unhindered.	1
Your	1
fellow	1
citizens	1
are	1
returning	1
every	1
day	1
to	1
their	1
homes	1
and	1
orders	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
find	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
help	1
and	1
protection	1
due	1
to	1
their	1
misfortunes.	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
measures	1
the	1
government	1
has	1
adopted	1
to	1
re-	1
establish	1
order	1
and	1
relieve	1
your	1
condition.	1
But	1
to	1
achieve	1
this	1
aim	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
add	1
your	1
efforts	1
and	1
should,	1
if	1
possible,	1
forget	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
you	1
have	1
suffered,	1
should	1
entertain	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
less	1
cruel	1
fate,	1
should	1
be	1
certain	1
that	1
inevitable	1
and	1
ignominious	1
death	1
awaits	1
those	1
who	1
make	1
any	1
attempt	1
on	1
your	1
persons	1
or	1
on	1
what	1
remains	1
of	1
your	1
property,	1
and	1
finally	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
these	1
will	1
be	1
safeguarded,	1
since	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
and	1
most	1
just	1
of	1
monarchs.	1
Soldiers	1
and	1
citizens,	1
of	1
whatever	1
nation	1
you	1
may	1
be,	1
re-	1
establish	1
public	1
confidence,	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
a	1
state,	1
live	1
like	1
brothers,	1
render	1
mutual	1
aid	1
and	1
protection	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
unite	1
to	1
defeat	1
the	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
evil-minded,	1
obey	1
the	1
military	1
and	1
civil	1
authorities,	1
and	1
your	1
tears	1
will	1
soon	1
cease	1
to	1
flow!	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
supplies	1
for	1
the	1
army,	1
Napoleon	1
decreed	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
troops	1
in	1
turn	1
should	1
enter	1
Moscow	1
a	1
la	1
maraude	1
*	1
to	1
obtain	1
provisions	1
for	1
themselves,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
might	1
have	1
its	1
future	1
provided	1
for.	1
	1
	1
*	1
As	1
looters.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
religion,	1
Napoleon	1
ordered	1
the	1
priests	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
back	1
and	1
services	1
to	1
be	1
again	1
performed	1
in	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
commerce	1
and	1
to	1
provisioning	1
the	1
army,	1
the	1
following	1
was	1
placarded	1
everywhere:	1
	1
PROCLAMATION!	1
	1
You,	1
peaceful	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
artisans	1
and	1
workmen	1
whom	1
misfortune	1
has	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
you	1
scattered	1
tillers	1
of	1
the	1
soil,	1
still	1
kept	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
by	1
groundless	1
fear,	1
listen!	1
Tranquillity	1
is	1
returning	1
to	1
this	1
capital	1
and	1
order	1
is	1
being	1
restored	1
in	1
it.	1
Your	1
fellow	1
countrymen	1
are	1
emerging	1
boldly	1
from	1
their	1
hiding	1
places	1
on	1
finding	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
respected.	1
Any	1
violence	1
to	1
them	1
or	1
to	1
their	1
property	1
is	1
promptly	1
punished.	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
King	1
protects	1
them,	1
and	1
considers	1
no	1
one	1
among	1
you	1
his	1
enemy	1
except	1
those	1
who	1
disobey	1
his	1
orders.	1
He	1
desires	1
to	1
end	1
your	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
restore	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
homes	1
and	1
families.	1
Respond,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
his	1
benevolent	1
intentions	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
without	1
fear.	1
Inhabitants,	1
return	1
with	1
confidence	1
to	1
your	1
abodes!	1
You	1
will	1
soon	1
find	1
means	1
of	1
satisfying	1
your	1
needs.	1
Craftsmen	1
and	1
industrious	1
artisans,	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
work,	1
your	1
houses,	1
your	1
shops,	1
where	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
guards	1
awaits	1
you!	1
You	1
shall	1
receive	1
proper	1
pay	1
for	1
your	1
work.	1
And	1
lastly	1
you	1
too,	1
peasants,	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
forests	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
hiding	1
in	1
terror,	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
huts	1
without	1
fear,	1
in	1
full	1
assurance	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
protection!	1
Markets	1
are	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
where	1
peasants	1
can	1
bring	1
their	1
surplus	1
supplies	1
and	1
the	1
products	1
of	1
the	1
soil.	1
The	1
government	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
following	1
steps	1
to	1
ensure	1
freedom	1
of	1
sale	1
for	1
them:	1
(1)	1
From	1
today,	1
peasants,	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
those	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
Moscow	1
may	1
without	1
any	1
danger	1
bring	1
their	1
supplies	1
of	1
all	1
kinds	1
to	1
two	1
appointed	1
markets,	1
of	1
which	1
one	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
Mokhovaya	1
Street	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
Provision	1
Market.	1
(2)	1
Such	1
supplies	1
will	1
be	1
bought	1
from	1
them	1
at	1
such	1
prices	1
as	1
seller	1
and	1
buyer	1
may	1
agree	1
on,	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
seller	1
is	1
unable	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
fair	1
price	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
free	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
goods	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
village	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
may	1
hinder	1
him	1
under	1
any	1
pretense.	1
(3)	1
Sunday	1
and	1
Wednesday	1
of	1
each	1
week	1
are	1
appointed	1
as	1
the	1
chief	1
market	1
days	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
end	1
a	1
sufficient	1
number	1
of	1
troops	1
will	1
be	1
stationed	1
along	1
the	1
highroads	1
on	1
Tuesdays	1
and	1
Saturdays	1
at	1
such	1
distances	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
as	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
carts.	1
(4)	1
Similar	1
measures	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
that	1
peasants	1
with	1
their	1
carts	1
and	1
horses	1
may	1
meet	1
with	1
no	1
hindrance	1
on	1
their	1
return	1
journey.	1
(5)	1
Steps	1
will	1
immediately	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
re-establish	1
ordinary	1
trading.	1
	1
Inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
villages,	1
and	1
you,	1
workingmen	1
and	1
artisans,	1
to	1
whatever	1
nation	1
you	1
belong,	1
you	1
are	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
paternal	1
intentions	1
of	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
King	1
and	1
to	1
co-	1
operate	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
welfare!	1
Lay	1
your	1
respect	1
and	1
confidence	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
delay	1
to	1
unite	1
with	1
us!	1
	1
With	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
raising	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
reviews	1
were	1
constantly	1
held	1
and	1
rewards	1
distributed.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
rode	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
to	1
comfort	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
and,	1
despite	1
his	1
preoccupation	1
with	1
state	1
affairs,	1
himself	1
visited	1
the	1
theaters	1
that	1
were	1
established	1
by	1
his	1
order.	1
	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
philanthropy,	1
the	1
greatest	1
virtue	1
of	1
crowned	1
heads,	1
Napoleon	1
also	1
did	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
He	1
caused	1
the	1
words	1
Maison	1
de	1
ma	1
Mere	1
to	1
be	1
inscribed	1
on	1
the	1
charitable	1
institutions,	1
thereby	1
combining	1
tender	1
filial	1
affection	1
with	1
the	1
majestic	1
benevolence	1
of	1
a	1
monarch.	1
He	1
visited	1
the	1
Foundling	1
Hospital	1
and,	1
allowing	1
the	1
orphans	1
saved	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
kiss	1
his	1
white	1
hands,	1
graciously	1
conversed	1
with	1
Tutolmin.	1
Then,	1
as	1
Thiers	1
eloquently	1
recounts,	1
he	1
ordered	1
his	1
soldiers	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
in	1
forged	1
Russian	1
money	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
prepared:	1
"Raising	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
these	1
means	1
by	1
an	1
act	1
worthy	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
he	1
let	1
relief	1
be	1
distributed	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
burned	1
out.	1
But	1
as	1
food	1
was	1
too	1
precious	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
foreigners,	1
who	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
enemies,	1
Napoleon	1
preferred	1
to	1
supply	1
them	1
with	1
money	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
purchase	1
food	1
from	1
outside,	1
and	1
had	1
paper	1
rubles	1
distributed	1
to	1
them."	1
	1
With	1
reference	1
to	1
army	1
discipline,	1
orders	1
were	1
continually	1
being	1
issued	1
to	1
inflict	1
severe	1
punishment	1
for	1
the	1
nonperformance	1
of	1
military	1
duties	1
and	1
to	1
suppress	1
robbery.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
But	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
all	1
these	1
measures,	1
efforts,	1
and	1
plans--which	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
worse	1
than	1
others	1
issued	1
in	1
similar	1
circumstances--did	1
not	1
affect	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
but,	1
like	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
clock	1
detached	1
from	1
the	1
mechanism,	1
swung	1
about	1
in	1
an	1
arbitrary	1
and	1
aimless	1
way	1
without	1
engaging	1
the	1
cogwheels.	1
	1
With	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
military	1
side--the	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign--that	1
work	1
of	1
genius	1
of	1
which	1
Thiers	1
remarks	1
that,	1
"His	1
genius	1
never	1
devised	1
anything	1
more	1
profound,	1
more	1
skillful,	1
or	1
more	1
admirable,"	1
and	1
enters	1
into	1
a	1
polemic	1
with	1
M.	1
Fain	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
this	1
work	1
of	1
genius	1
must	1
be	1
referred	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
fourth	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
of	1
October--that	1
plan	1
never	1
was	1
or	1
could	1
be	1
executed,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
case.	1
The	1
fortifying	1
of	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
for	1
which	1
la	1
Mosquee	1
(as	1
Napoleon	1
termed	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Basil	1
the	1
Beatified)	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
razed	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
proved	1
quite	1
useless.	1
The	1
mining	1
of	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
only	1
helped	1
toward	1
fulfilling	1
Napoleon's	1
wish	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
blown	1
up	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
Moscow--as	1
a	1
child	1
wants	1
the	1
floor	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
hurt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
beaten.	1
The	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
about	1
which	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
so	1
concerned,	1
produced	1
an	1
unheard-of	1
result.	1
The	1
French	1
generals	1
lost	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
of	1
sixty	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
Thiers	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
eventually	1
found,	1
like	1
a	1
lost	1
pin,	1
by	1
the	1
skill--and	1
apparently	1
the	1
genius--of	1
Murat.	1
	1
With	1
reference	1
to	1
diplomacy,	1
all	1
Napoleon's	1
arguments	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
magnanimity	1
and	1
justice,	1
both	1
to	1
Tutolmin	1
and	1
to	1
Yakovlev	1
(whose	1
chief	1
concern	1
was	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
greatcoat	1
and	1
a	1
conveyance),	1
proved	1
useless;	1
Alexander	1
did	1
not	1
receive	1
these	1
envoys	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
to	1
their	1
embassage.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
legal	1
matters,	1
after	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
supposed	1
incendiaries	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Moscow	1
burned	1
down.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
administrative	1
matters,	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
municipality	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
the	1
robberies	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
certain	1
people	1
who	1
formed	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
municipality	1
and	1
under	1
pretext	1
of	1
preserving	1
order	1
looted	1
Moscow	1
or	1
saved	1
their	1
own	1
property	1
from	1
being	1
looted.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
religion,	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
in	1
Egypt	1
matters	1
had	1
so	1
easily	1
been	1
settled	1
by	1
Napoleon's	1
visit	1
to	1
a	1
mosque,	1
no	1
results	1
were	1
achieved.	1
Two	1
or	1
three	1
priests	1
who	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
Moscow	1
did	1
try	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
Napoleon's	1
wish,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
slapped	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
soldier	1
while	1
conducting	1
service,	1
and	1
a	1
French	1
official	1
reported	1
of	1
another	1
that:	1
"The	1
priest	1
whom	1
I	1
found	1
and	1
invited	1
to	1
say	1
Mass	1
cleaned	1
and	1
locked	1
up	1
the	1
church.	1
That	1
night	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
again	1
broken	1
open,	1
the	1
padlocks	1
smashed,	1
the	1
books	1
mutilated,	1
and	1
other	1
disorders	1
perpetrated."	1
	1
With	1
reference	1
to	1
commerce,	1
the	1
proclamation	1
to	1
industrious	1
workmen	1
and	1
to	1
peasants	1
evoked	1
no	1
response.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
industrious	1
workmen,	1
and	1
the	1
peasants	1
caught	1
the	1
commissaries	1
who	1
ventured	1
too	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
town	1
with	1
the	1
proclamation	1
and	1
killed	1
them.	1
	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
theaters	1
for	1
the	1
entertainment	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
troops,	1
these	1
did	1
not	1
meet	1
with	1
success	1
either.	1
The	1
theaters	1
set	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
and	1
in	1
Posnyakov's	1
house	1
were	1
closed	1
again	1
at	1
once	1
because	1
the	1
actors	1
and	1
actresses	1
were	1
robbed.	1
	1
Even	1
philanthropy	1
did	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
desired	1
effect.	1
The	1
genuine	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
false	1
paper	1
money	1
which	1
flooded	1
Moscow	1
lost	1
its	1
value.	1
The	1
French,	1
collecting	1
booty,	1
cared	1
only	1
for	1
gold.	1
Not	1
only	1
was	1
the	1
paper	1
money	1
valueless	1
which	1
Napoleon	1
so	1
graciously	1
distributed	1
to	1
the	1
unfortunate,	1
but	1
even	1
silver	1
lost	1
its	1
value	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
gold.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
most	1
amazing	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
ineffectiveness	1
of	1
the	1
orders	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
authorities	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
Napoleon's	1
attempt	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
looting	1
and	1
re-establish	1
discipline.	1
	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
army	1
authorities	1
were	1
reporting:	1
	1
"Looting	1
continues	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
despite	1
the	1
decrees	1
against	1
it.	1
Order	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
restored	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
merchant	1
is	1
carrying	1
on	1
trade	1
in	1
a	1
lawful	1
manner.	1
The	1
sutlers	1
alone	1
venture	1
to	1
trade,	1
and	1
they	1
sell	1
stolen	1
goods."	1
	1
"The	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
my	1
ward	1
continues	1
to	1
be	1
pillaged	1
by	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
3rd	1
Corps	1
who,	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
taking	1
from	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
inhabitants	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
cellars	1
the	1
little	1
they	1
have	1
left,	1
even	1
have	1
the	1
ferocity	1
to	1
wound	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
sabers,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
repeatedly	1
witnessed."	1
	1
"Nothing	1
new,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
soldiers	1
are	1
robbing	1
and	1
pillaging--	1
October	1
9."	1
	1
"Robbery	1
and	1
pillaging	1
continue.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
thieves	1
in	1
our	1
district	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
arrested	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
force--October	1
11."	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
is	1
extremely	1
displeased	1
that	1
despite	1
the	1
strict	1
orders	1
to	1
stop	1
pillage,	1
parties	1
of	1
marauding	1
Guards	1
are	1
continually	1
seen	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
Kremlin.	1
Among	1
the	1
Old	1
Guard	1
disorder	1
and	1
pillage	1
were	1
renewed	1
more	1
violently	1
than	1
ever	1
yesterday	1
evening,	1
last	1
night,	1
and	1
today.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
sees	1
with	1
regret	1
that	1
the	1
picked	1
soldiers	1
appointed	1
to	1
guard	1
his	1
person,	1
who	1
should	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
discipline,	1
carry	1
disobedience	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
they	1
break	1
into	1
the	1
cellars	1
and	1
stores	1
containing	1
army	1
supplies.	1
Others	1
have	1
disgraced	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
disobeying	1
sentinels	1
and	1
officers,	1
and	1
have	1
abused	1
and	1
beaten	1
them."	1
	1
"The	1
Grand	1
Marshal	1
of	1
the	1
palace,"	1
wrote	1
the	1
governor,	1
"complains	1
bitterly	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
repeated	1
orders,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
continue	1
to	1
commit	1
nuisances	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
courtyards	1
and	1
even	1
under	1
the	1
very	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor."	1
	1
That	1
army,	1
like	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
run	1
wild	1
and	1
trampling	1
underfoot	1
the	1
provender	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
saved	1
it	1
from	1
starvation,	1
disintegrated	1
and	1
perished	1
with	1
each	1
additional	1
day	1
it	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
But	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
away.	1
	1
It	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
only	1
when	1
suddenly	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
panic	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
transport	1
trains	1
on	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino.	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
that	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino,	1
unexpectedly	1
received	1
by	1
Napoleon	1
at	1
a	1
review,	1
evoked	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
Russians	1
(Thiers	1
says),	1
and	1
he	1
issued	1
the	1
order	1
for	1
departure	1
which	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
was	1
demanding.	1
	1
Fleeing	1
from	1
Moscow	1
the	1
soldiers	1
took	1
with	1
them	1
everything	1
they	1
had	1
stolen.	1
Napoleon,	1
too,	1
carried	1
away	1
his	1
own	1
personal	1
tresor,	1
but	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
baggage	1
trains	1
that	1
impeded	1
the	1
army,	1
he	1
was	1
(Thiers	1
says)	1
horror-struck.	1
And	1
yet	1
with	1
his	1
experience	1
of	1
war	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
order	1
all	1
the	1
superfluous	1
vehicles	1
to	1
be	1
burned,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
marshal	1
when	1
approaching	1
Moscow.	1
He	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
caleches	1
and	1
carriages	1
in	1
which	1
soldiers	1
were	1
riding	1
and	1
remarked	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing,	1
as	1
those	1
vehicles	1
could	1
be	1
used	1
to	1
carry	1
provisions,	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
the	1
wounded.	1
	1
The	1
plight	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
resembled	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
wounded	1
animal	1
which	1
feels	1
it	1
is	1
perishing	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
doing.	1
To	1
study	1
the	1
skillful	1
tactics	1
and	1
aims	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
entered	1
Moscow	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
destroyed	1
is	1
like	1
studying	1
the	1
dying	1
leaps	1
and	1
shudders	1
of	1
a	1
mortally	1
wounded	1
animal.	1
Very	1
often	1
a	1
wounded	1
animal,	1
hearing	1
a	1
rustle,	1
rushes	1
straight	1
at	1
the	1
hunter's	1
gun,	1
runs	1
forward	1
and	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
hastens	1
its	1
own	1
end.	1
Napoleon,	1
under	1
pressure	1
from	1
his	1
whole	1
army,	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
The	1
rustle	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino	1
frightened	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
it	1
rushed	1
forward	1
onto	1
the	1
hunter's	1
gun,	1
reached	1
him,	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
finally--like	1
any	1
wild	1
beast--ran	1
back	1
along	1
the	1
most	1
disadvantageous	1
and	1
dangerous	1
path,	1
where	1
the	1
old	1
scent	1
was	1
familiar.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
period	1
Napoleon,	1
who	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
movements--as	1
the	1
figurehead	1
of	1
a	1
ship	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
a	1
savage	1
to	1
guide	1
the	1
vessel--acted	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
who,	1
holding	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
strings	1
inside	1
a	1
carriage,	1
thinks	1
he	1
is	1
driving	1
it.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
sixth	1
of	1
October	1
Pierre	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed,	1
and	1
on	1
returning	1
stopped	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
blue-	1
gray	1
dog,	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
body	1
and	1
short	1
bandy	1
legs,	1
that	1
jumped	1
about	1
him.	1
This	1
little	1
dog	1
lived	1
in	1
their	1
shed,	1
sleeping	1
beside	1
Karataev	1
at	1
night;	1
it	1
sometimes	1
made	1
excursions	1
into	1
the	1
town	1
but	1
always	1
returned	1
again.	1
Probably	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
an	1
owner,	1
and	1
it	1
still	1
belonged	1
to	1
nobody	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
name.	1
The	1
French	1
called	1
it	1
Azor;	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
told	1
stories	1
called	1
it	1
Femgalka;	1
Karataev	1
and	1
others	1
called	1
it	1
Gray,	1
or	1
sometimes	1
Flabby.	1
Its	1
lack	1
of	1
a	1
master,	1
a	1
name,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
a	1
breed	1
or	1
any	1
definite	1
color	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
trouble	1
the	1
blue-gray	1
dog	1
in	1
the	1
least.	1
Its	1
furry	1
tail	1
stood	1
up	1
firm	1
and	1
round	1
as	1
a	1
plume,	1
its	1
bandy	1
legs	1
served	1
it	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
often	1
gracefully	1
lift	1
a	1
hind	1
leg	1
and	1
run	1
very	1
easily	1
and	1
quickly	1
on	1
three	1
legs,	1
as	1
if	1
disdaining	1
to	1
use	1
all	1
four.	1
Everything	1
pleased	1
it.	1
Now	1
it	1
would	1
roll	1
on	1
its	1
back,	1
yelping	1
with	1
delight,	1
now	1
bask	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
air	1
of	1
importance,	1
and	1
now	1
frolic	1
about	1
playing	1
with	1
a	1
chip	1
of	1
wood	1
or	1
a	1
straw.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
attire	1
by	1
now	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
dirty	1
torn	1
shirt	1
(the	1
only	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
clothing),	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
soldier's	1
trousers	1
which	1
by	1
Karataev's	1
advice	1
he	1
tied	1
with	1
string	1
round	1
the	1
ankles	1
for	1
warmth,	1
and	1
a	1
peasant	1
coat	1
and	1
cap.	1
Physically	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
much	1
during	1
this	1
time.	1
He	1
no	1
longer	1
seemed	1
stout,	1
though	1
he	1
still	1
had	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
solidity	1
and	1
strength	1
hereditary	1
in	1
his	1
family.	1
A	1
beard	1
and	1
mustache	1
covered	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
a	1
tangle	1
of	1
hair,	1
infested	1
with	1
lice,	1
curled	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
cap.	1
The	1
look	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
was	1
resolute,	1
calm,	1
and	1
animatedly	1
alert,	1
as	1
never	1
before.	1
The	1
former	1
slackness	1
which	1
had	1
shown	1
itself	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
was	1
now	1
replaced	1
by	1
an	1
energetic	1
readiness	1
for	1
action	1
and	1
resistance.	1
His	1
feet	1
were	1
bare.	1
	1
Pierre	1
first	1
looked	1
down	1
the	1
field	1
across	1
which	1
vehicles	1
and	1
horsemen	1
were	1
passing	1
that	1
morning,	1
then	1
into	1
the	1
distance	1
across	1
the	1
river,	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
dog	1
who	1
was	1
pretending	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
earnest	1
about	1
biting	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
his	1
bare	1
feet	1
which	1
he	1
placed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
in	1
various	1
positions,	1
moving	1
his	1
dirty	1
thick	1
big	1
toes.	1
Every	1
time	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
bare	1
feet	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
animated	1
self-satisfaction	1
flitted	1
across	1
his	1
face.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
them	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
and	1
learned	1
during	1
these	1
weeks	1
and	1
this	1
recollection	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
For	1
some	1
days	1
the	1
weather	1
had	1
been	1
calm	1
and	1
clear	1
with	1
slight	1
frosts	1
in	1
the	1
mornings--what	1
is	1
called	1
an	1
"old	1
wives'	1
summer."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
sunshine	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
warm,	1
and	1
that	1
warmth	1
was	1
particularly	1
pleasant	1
with	1
the	1
invigorating	1
freshness	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
frost	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
On	1
everything--far	1
and	1
near--lay	1
the	1
magic	1
crystal	1
glitter	1
seen	1
only	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
autumn.	1
The	1
Sparrow	1
Hills	1
were	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
with	1
the	1
village,	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
the	1
large	1
white	1
house.	1
The	1
bare	1
trees,	1
the	1
sand,	1
the	1
bricks	1
and	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
the	1
green	1
church	1
spire,	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
all	1
stood	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
transparent	1
air	1
in	1
most	1
delicate	1
outline	1
and	1
with	1
unnatural	1
clearness.	1
Near	1
by	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
the	1
familiar	1
ruins	1
of	1
a	1
half-burned	1
mansion	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
with	1
lilac	1
bushes	1
still	1
showing	1
dark	1
green	1
beside	1
the	1
fence.	1
And	1
even	1
that	1
ruined	1
and	1
befouled	1
house--which	1
in	1
dull	1
weather	1
was	1
repulsively	1
ugly--seemed	1
quietly	1
beautiful	1
now,	1
in	1
the	1
clear,	1
motionless	1
brilliance.	1
	1
A	1
French	1
corporal,	1
with	1
coat	1
unbuttoned	1
in	1
a	1
homely	1
way,	1
a	1
skullcap	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
pipe	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
came	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
and	1
approached	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
wink.	1
	1
"What	1
sunshine,	1
Monsieur	1
Kiril!"	1
(Their	1
name	1
for	1
Pierre.)	1
"Eh?	1
Just	1
like	1
spring!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
corporal	1
leaned	1
against	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
offered	1
Pierre	1
his	1
pipe,	1
though	1
whenever	1
he	1
offered	1
it	1
Pierre	1
always	1
declined	1
it.	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
in	1
such	1
weather..."	1
he	1
began.	1
	1
Pierre	1
inquired	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
about	1
leaving,	1
and	1
the	1
corporal	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
starting	1
and	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
order	1
about	1
the	1
prisoners	1
that	1
day.	1
Sokolov,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
dying,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
told	1
the	1
corporal	1
that	1
something	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
about	1
him.	1
The	1
corporal	1
replied	1
that	1
Pierre	1
need	1
not	1
worry	1
about	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
an	1
ambulance	1
and	1
a	1
permanent	1
hospital	1
and	1
arrangements	1
would	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
general	1
everything	1
that	1
could	1
happen	1
had	1
been	1
foreseen	1
by	1
the	1
authorities.	1
	1
"Besides,	1
Monsieur	1
Kiril,	1
you	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
captain,	1
you	1
know.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
never	1
forgets	1
anything.	1
Speak	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
when	1
he	1
makes	1
his	1
round,	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
(The	1
captain	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
corporal	1
spoke	1
often	1
had	1
long	1
chats	1
with	1
Pierre	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
favors.)	1
	1
"'You	1
see,	1
St.	1
Thomas,'	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
other	1
day.	1
'Monsieur	1
Kiril	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
education,	1
who	1
speaks	1
French.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
Russian	1
seigneur	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
misfortunes,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man.	1
He	1
knows	1
what's	1
what....	1
If	1
he	1
wants	1
anything	1
and	1
asks	1
me,	1
he	1
won't	1
get	1
a	1
refusal.	1
When	1
one	1
has	1
studied,	1
you	1
see,	1
one	1
likes	1
education	1
and	1
well-bred	1
people.'	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
I	1
mention	1
it,	1
Monsieur	1
Kiril.	1
The	1
other	1
day	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
affair	1
would	1
have	1
ended	1
ill."	1
	1
And	1
after	1
chatting	1
a	1
while	1
longer,	1
the	1
corporal	1
went	1
away.	1
(The	1
affair	1
he	1
had	1
alluded	1
to	1
had	1
happened	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before--a	1
fight	1
between	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers,	1
in	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
pacifying	1
his	1
comrades.)	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
Pierre	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
corporal	1
immediately	1
asked	1
what	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
said.	1
While	1
Pierre	1
was	1
repeating	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
about	1
the	1
army	1
leaving	1
Moscow,	1
a	1
thin,	1
sallow,	1
tattered	1
French	1
soldier	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
shed.	1
Rapidly	1
and	1
timidly	1
raising	1
his	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
forehead	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
greeting,	1
he	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
whether	1
the	1
soldier	1
Platoche	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
shirt	1
to	1
sew	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
shed.	1
	1
A	1
week	1
before	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
had	1
boot	1
leather	1
and	1
linen	1
issued	1
to	1
them,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
into	1
boots	1
and	1
shirts	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
"Ready,	1
ready,	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
said	1
Karataev,	1
coming	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
neatly	1
folded	1
shirt.	1
	1
Karataev,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
warm	1
weather	1
and	1
for	1
convenience	1
at	1
work,	1
was	1
wearing	1
only	1
trousers	1
and	1
a	1
tattered	1
shirt	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
soot.	1
His	1
hair	1
was	1
bound	1
round,	1
workman	1
fashion,	1
with	1
a	1
wisp	1
of	1
lime-tree	1
bast,	1
and	1
his	1
round	1
face	1
seemed	1
rounder	1
and	1
pleasanter	1
than	1
ever.	1
	1
"A	1
promise	1
is	1
own	1
brother	1
to	1
performance!	1
I	1
said	1
Friday	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
is,	1
ready,"	1
said	1
Platon,	1
smiling	1
and	1
unfolding	1
the	1
shirt	1
he	1
had	1
sewn.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
glanced	1
around	1
uneasily	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
if	1
overcoming	1
his	1
hesitation,	1
rapidly	1
threw	1
off	1
his	1
uniform	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
shirt.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
long,	1
greasy,	1
flowered	1
silk	1
waistcoat	1
next	1
to	1
his	1
sallow,	1
thin	1
bare	1
body,	1
but	1
no	1
shirt.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
afraid	1
the	1
prisoners	1
looking	1
on	1
would	1
laugh	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
thrust	1
his	1
head	1
into	1
the	1
shirt	1
hurriedly.	1
None	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
said	1
a	1
word.	1
	1
"See,	1
it	1
fits	1
well!"	1
Platon	1
kept	1
repeating,	1
pulling	1
the	1
shirt	1
straight.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman,	1
having	1
pushed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
hands	1
through,	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes,	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
shirt	1
and	1
examined	1
the	1
seams.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
dear	1
man,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
sewing	1
shop,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
proper	1
tools;	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
say,	1
one	1
needs	1
a	1
tool	1
even	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
louse,"	1
said	1
Platon	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
round	1
smiles,	1
obviously	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
"It's	1
good,	1
quite	1
good,	1
thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
in	1
French,	1
"but	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
linen	1
left	1
over."	1
	1
"It	1
will	1
fit	1
better	1
still	1
when	1
it	1
sets	1
to	1
your	1
body,"	1
said	1
Karataev,	1
still	1
admiring	1
his	1
handiwork.	1
"You'll	1
be	1
nice	1
and	1
comfortable...."	1
	1
"Thanks,	1
thanks,	1
old	1
fellow....	1
But	1
the	1
bits	1
left	1
over?"	1
said	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
again	1
and	1
smiled.	1
He	1
took	1
out	1
an	1
assignation	1
ruble	1
note	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Karataev.	1
"But	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
pieces	1
that	1
are	1
over."	1
	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
Platon	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
was	1
saying,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
without	1
interfering.	1
Karataev	1
thanked	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
for	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
admiring	1
his	1
own	1
work.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
insisted	1
on	1
having	1
the	1
pieces	1
returned	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
over	1
and	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
to	1
translate	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
he	1
want	1
the	1
bits	1
for?"	1
said	1
Karataev.	1
"They'd	1
make	1
fine	1
leg	1
bands	1
for	1
us.	1
Well,	1
never	1
mind."	1
	1
And	1
Karataev,	1
with	1
a	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
and	1
saddened	1
expression,	1
took	1
a	1
small	1
bundle	1
of	1
scraps	1
from	1
inside	1
his	1
shirt	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
"Oh	1
dear!"	1
muttered	1
Karataev	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
linen,	1
considered	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
then	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
Pierre's	1
look	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
something,	1
suddenly	1
blushed	1
and	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
squeaky	1
voice:	1
	1
"Platoche!	1
Eh,	1
Platoche!	1
Keep	1
them	1
yourself!"	1
And	1
handing	1
back	1
the	1
odd	1
bits	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
"There,	1
look	1
at	1
that,"	1
said	1
Karataev,	1
swaying	1
his	1
head.	1
"People	1
said	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
Christians,	1
but	1
they	1
too	1
have	1
souls.	1
It's	1
what	1
the	1
old	1
folk	1
used	1
to	1
say:	1
'A	1
sweating	1
hand's	1
an	1
open	1
hand,	1
a	1
dry	1
hand's	1
close.'	1
He's	1
naked,	1
but	1
yet	1
he's	1
given	1
it	1
back."	1
	1
Karataev	1
smiled	1
thoughtfully	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
awhile	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
pieces.	1
	1
"But	1
they'll	1
make	1
grand	1
leg	1
bands,	1
dear	1
friend,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
shed.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
Four	1
weeks	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
offered	1
to	1
move	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
men's	1
to	1
the	1
officers'	1
shed,	1
he	1
had	1
stayed	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
first	1
put.	1
	1
In	1
burned	1
and	1
devastated	1
Moscow	1
Pierre	1
experienced	1
almost	1
the	1
extreme	1
limits	1
of	1
privation	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
endure;	1
but	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
physical	1
strength	1
and	1
health,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
been	1
unconscious,	1
and	1
thanks	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
privations	1
came	1
so	1
gradually	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
they	1
began,	1
he	1
endured	1
his	1
position	1
not	1
only	1
lightly	1
but	1
joyfully.	1
And	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
obtained	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
ease	1
of	1
mind	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
striven	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
reach.	1
He	1
had	1
long	1
sought	1
in	1
different	1
ways	1
that	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
mind,	1
that	1
inner	1
harmony	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
impressed	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
soldiers	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
He	1
had	1
sought	1
it	1
in	1
philanthropy,	1
in	1
Freemasonry,	1
in	1
the	1
dissipations	1
of	1
town	1
life,	1
in	1
wine,	1
in	1
heroic	1
feats	1
of	1
self-sacrifice,	1
and	1
in	1
romantic	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha;	1
he	1
had	1
sought	1
it	1
by	1
reasoning--and	1
all	1
these	1
quests	1
and	1
experiments	1
had	1
failed	1
him.	1
And	1
now	1
without	1
thinking	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
that	1
peace	1
and	1
inner	1
harmony	1
only	1
through	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
death,	1
through	1
privation,	1
and	1
through	1
what	1
he	1
recognized	1
in	1
Karataev.	1
	1
Those	1
dreadful	1
moments	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
at	1
the	1
executions	1
had	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
forever	1
washed	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
imagination	1
and	1
memory	1
the	1
agitating	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
seemed	1
so	1
important.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
occur	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
Russia,	1
or	1
the	1
war,	1
or	1
politics,	1
or	1
Napoleon.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
no	1
business	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
judge	1
concerning	1
them	1
and	1
therefore	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
"Russia	1
and	1
summer	1
weather	1
are	1
not	1
bound	1
together,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
repeating	1
words	1
of	1
Karataev's	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
strangely	1
consoling.	1
His	1
intention	1
of	1
killing	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
calculations	1
of	1
the	1
cabalistic	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
Apocalypse	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
meaningless	1
and	1
even	1
ridiculous.	1
His	1
anger	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
anxiety	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
smirched	1
now	1
seemed	1
not	1
merely	1
trivial	1
but	1
even	1
amusing.	1
What	1
concern	1
was	1
it	1
of	1
his	1
that	1
somewhere	1
or	1
other	1
that	1
woman	1
was	1
leading	1
the	1
life	1
she	1
preferred?	1
What	1
did	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
anybody,	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
him,	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
they	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
their	1
prisoner's	1
name	1
was	1
Count	1
Bezukhov?	1
	1
He	1
now	1
often	1
remembered	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
quite	1
agreed	1
with	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
understood	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
thoughts	1
somewhat	1
differently.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
thought	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
happiness	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
negative,	1
but	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
bitterness	1
and	1
irony	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
saying	1
that	1
all	1
desire	1
for	1
positive	1
happiness	1
is	1
implanted	1
in	1
us	1
merely	1
to	1
torment	1
us	1
and	1
never	1
be	1
satisfied.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
believed	1
it	1
without	1
any	1
mental	1
reservation.	1
The	1
absence	1
of	1
suffering,	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
one's	1
needs	1
and	1
consequent	1
freedom	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
one's	1
occupation,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
one's	1
way	1
of	1
life,	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
to	1
be	1
indubitably	1
man's	1
highest	1
happiness.	1
Here	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
fully	1
appreciated	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
eating	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
eat,	1
drinking	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
drink,	1
sleeping	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
sleep,	1
of	1
warmth	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
cold,	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
fellow	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
talk	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
human	1
voice.	1
The	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
one's	1
needs--good	1
food,	1
cleanliness,	1
and	1
freedom--now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
to	1
constitute	1
perfect	1
happiness;	1
and	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
occupation,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
life--now	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
restricted--seemed	1
to	1
him	1
such	1
an	1
easy	1
matter	1
that	1
he	1
forgot	1
that	1
a	1
superfluity	1
of	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life	1
destroys	1
all	1
joy	1
in	1
satisfying	1
one's	1
needs,	1
while	1
great	1
freedom	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
occupation--such	1
freedom	1
as	1
his	1
wealth,	1
his	1
education,	1
and	1
his	1
social	1
position	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
life--is	1
just	1
what	1
makes	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
occupation	1
insolubly	1
difficult	1
and	1
destroys	1
the	1
desire	1
and	1
possibility	1
of	1
having	1
an	1
occupation.	1
	1
All	1
Pierre's	1
daydreams	1
now	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
free.	1
Yet	1
subsequently,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
spoke	1
with	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
that	1
month	1
of	1
captivity,	1
of	1
those	1
irrecoverable,	1
strong,	1
joyful	1
sensations,	1
and	1
chiefly	1
of	1
the	1
complete	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
inner	1
freedom	1
which	1
he	1
experienced	1
only	1
during	1
those	1
weeks.	1
	1
When	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
early,	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
at	1
dawn,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
cupolas	1
and	1
crosses	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Convent	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin	1
still	1
dark	1
at	1
first,	1
the	1
hoarfrost	1
on	1
the	1
dusty	1
grass,	1
the	1
Sparrow	1
Hills,	1
and	1
the	1
wooded	1
banks	1
above	1
the	1
winding	1
river	1
vanishing	1
in	1
the	1
purple	1
distance,	1
when	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
contact	1
of	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
crows	1
flying	1
from	1
Moscow	1
across	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
when	1
afterwards	1
light	1
gleamed	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
the	1
sun's	1
rim	1
appeared	1
solemnly	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
the	1
cupolas	1
and	1
crosses,	1
the	1
hoarfrost,	1
the	1
distance	1
and	1
the	1
river,	1
all	1
began	1
to	1
sparkle	1
in	1
the	1
glad	1
light--Pierre	1
felt	1
a	1
new	1
joy	1
and	1
strength	1
in	1
life	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
known.	1
And	1
this	1
not	1
only	1
stayed	1
with	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
imprisonment,	1
but	1
even	1
grew	1
in	1
strength	1
as	1
the	1
hardships	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
increased.	1
	1
That	1
feeling	1
of	1
alertness	1
and	1
of	1
readiness	1
for	1
anything	1
was	1
still	1
further	1
strengthened	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
opinion	1
his	1
fellow	1
prisoners	1
formed	1
of	1
him	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
shed.	1
With	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
languages,	1
the	1
respect	1
shown	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
his	1
simplicity,	1
his	1
readiness	1
to	1
give	1
anything	1
asked	1
of	1
him	1
(he	1
received	1
the	1
allowance	1
of	1
three	1
rubles	1
a	1
week	1
made	1
to	1
officers);	1
with	1
his	1
strength,	1
which	1
he	1
showed	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
by	1
pressing	1
nails	1
into	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
hut;	1
his	1
gentleness	1
to	1
his	1
companions,	1
and	1
his	1
capacity	1
for	1
sitting	1
still	1
and	1
thinking	1
without	1
doing	1
anything	1
(which	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
incomprehensible),	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
rather	1
mysterious	1
and	1
superior	1
being.	1
The	1
very	1
qualities	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
hindrance,	1
if	1
not	1
actually	1
harmful,	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
in--his	1
strength,	1
his	1
disdain	1
for	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life,	1
his	1
absent-mindedness	1
and	1
simplicity--here	1
among	1
these	1
people	1
gave	1
him	1
almost	1
the	1
status	1
of	1
a	1
hero.	1
And	1
Pierre	1
felt	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
The	1
French	1
evacuation	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
between	1
the	1
sixth	1
and	1
seventh	1
of	1
October:	1
kitchens	1
and	1
sheds	1
were	1
dismantled,	1
carts	1
loaded,	1
and	1
troops	1
and	1
baggage	1
trains	1
started.	1
	1
At	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
a	1
French	1
convoy	1
in	1
marching	1
trim,	1
wearing	1
shakos	1
and	1
carrying	1
muskets,	1
knapsacks,	1
and	1
enormous	1
sacks,	1
stood	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
sheds,	1
and	1
animated	1
French	1
talk	1
mingled	1
with	1
curses	1
sounded	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
lines.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
shed	1
everyone	1
was	1
ready,	1
dressed,	1
belted,	1
shod,	1
and	1
only	1
awaited	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
start.	1
The	1
sick	1
soldier,	1
Sokolov,	1
pale	1
and	1
thin	1
with	1
dark	1
shadows	1
round	1
his	1
eyes,	1
alone	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
barefoot	1
and	1
not	1
dressed.	1
His	1
eyes,	1
prominent	1
from	1
the	1
emaciation	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
gazed	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
comrades	1
who	1
were	1
paying	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
moaned	1
regularly	1
and	1
quietly.	1
It	1
was	1
evidently	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
his	1
sufferings	1
that	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
moan	1
(he	1
had	1
dysentery)	1
as	1
his	1
fear	1
and	1
grief	1
at	1
being	1
left	1
alone.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
girt	1
with	1
a	1
rope	1
round	1
his	1
waist	1
and	1
wearing	1
shoes	1
Karataev	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
some	1
leather	1
a	1
French	1
soldier	1
had	1
torn	1
off	1
a	1
tea	1
chest	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
boots	1
mended	1
with,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
and	1
squatted	1
down	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Sokolov,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
going	1
away!	1
They	1
have	1
a	1
hospital	1
here.	1
You	1
may	1
be	1
better	1
off	1
than	1
we	1
others,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord!	1
Oh,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
me!	1
O	1
Lord!"	1
moaned	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
louder	1
voice.	1
	1
"I'll	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
them	1
again	1
directly,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
rising	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
shed.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
Pierre	1
reached	1
the	1
door,	1
the	1
corporal	1
who	1
had	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
pipe	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
with	1
two	1
soldiers.	1
The	1
corporal	1
and	1
soldiers	1
were	1
in	1
marching	1
kit	1
with	1
knapsacks	1
and	1
shakos	1
that	1
had	1
metal	1
straps,	1
and	1
these	1
changed	1
their	1
familiar	1
faces.	1
	1
The	1
corporal	1
came,	1
according	1
to	1
orders,	1
to	1
shut	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
prisoners	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
counted	1
before	1
being	1
let	1
out.	1
	1
"Corporal,	1
what	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
sick	1
man?..."	1
Pierre	1
began.	1
	1
But	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
doubt	1
whether	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
corporal	1
he	1
knew	1
or	1
a	1
stranger,	1
so	1
unlike	1
himself	1
did	1
the	1
corporal	1
seem	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
Moreover,	1
just	1
as	1
Pierre	1
was	1
speaking	1
a	1
sharp	1
rattle	1
of	1
drums	1
was	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
from	1
both	1
sides.	1
The	1
corporal	1
frowned	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
words	1
and,	1
uttering	1
some	1
meaningless	1
oaths,	1
slammed	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
shed	1
became	1
semidark,	1
and	1
the	1
sharp	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
drums	1
on	1
two	1
sides	1
drowned	1
the	1
sick	1
man's	1
groans.	1
	1
"There	1
it	1
is!...	1
It	1
again!..."	1
said	1
Pierre	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
an	1
involuntary	1
shudder	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
spine.	1
In	1
the	1
corporal's	1
changed	1
face,	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice,	1
in	1
the	1
stirring	1
and	1
deafening	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
drums,	1
he	1
recognized	1
that	1
mysterious,	1
callous	1
force	1
which	1
compelled	1
people	1
against	1
their	1
will	1
to	1
kill	1
their	1
fellow	1
men--that	1
force	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
during	1
the	1
executions.	1
To	1
fear	1
or	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
escape	1
that	1
force,	1
to	1
address	1
entreaties	1
or	1
exhortations	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
served	1
as	1
its	1
tools,	1
was	1
useless.	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
this	1
now.	1
One	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
endure.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
again	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man,	1
nor	1
turn	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
but	1
stood	1
frowning	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
hut.	1
	1
When	1
that	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
crowding	1
against	1
one	1
another	1
like	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
sheep,	1
squeezed	1
into	1
the	1
exit,	1
Pierre	1
pushed	1
his	1
way	1
forward	1
and	1
approached	1
that	1
very	1
captain	1
who	1
as	1
the	1
corporal	1
had	1
assured	1
him	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
him.	1
The	1
captain	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
marching	1
kit,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
cold	1
face	1
appeared	1
that	1
same	1
it	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
recognized	1
in	1
the	1
corporal's	1
words	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
drums.	1
	1
"Pass	1
on,	1
pass	1
on!"	1
the	1
captain	1
reiterated,	1
frowning	1
sternly,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
prisoners	1
who	1
thronged	1
past	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
attempt	1
would	1
be	1
vain.	1
	1
"What	1
now?"	1
the	1
officer	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
recognizing	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Pierre	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
sick	1
man.	1
	1
"He'll	1
manage	1
to	1
walk,	1
devil	1
take	1
him!"	1
said	1
the	1
captain.	1
"Pass	1
on,	1
pass	1
on!"	1
he	1
continued	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
is	1
dying,"	1
Pierre	1
again	1
began.	1
	1
"Be	1
so	1
good..."	1
shouted	1
the	1
captain,	1
frowning	1
angrily.	1
	1
"Dram-da-da-dam,	1
dam-dam..."	1
rattled	1
the	1
drums,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
mysterious	1
force	1
completely	1
controlled	1
these	1
men	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
useless	1
to	1
say	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
prisoners	1
were	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
told	1
to	1
march	1
in	1
front.	1
There	1
were	1
about	1
thirty	1
officers,	1
with	1
Pierre	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
about	1
three	1
hundred	1
men.	1
	1
The	1
officers,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
sheds,	1
were	1
all	1
strangers	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
much	1
better	1
dressed	1
than	1
he.	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
shoes	1
mistrustfully,	1
as	1
at	1
an	1
alien.	1
Not	1
far	1
from	1
him	1
walked	1
a	1
fat	1
major	1
with	1
a	1
sallow,	1
bloated,	1
angry	1
face,	1
who	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
Kazan	1
dressing	1
gown	1
tied	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
towel,	1
and	1
who	1
evidently	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
respect	1
of	1
his	1
fellow	1
prisoners.	1
He	1
kept	1
one	1
hand,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
clasped	1
his	1
tobacco	1
pouch,	1
inside	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
held	1
the	1
stem	1
of	1
his	1
pipe	1
firmly	1
with	1
the	1
other.	1
Panting	1
and	1
puffing,	1
the	1
major	1
grumbled	1
and	1
growled	1
at	1
everybody	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
pushed	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
hurrying	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
nowhere	1
to	1
hurry	1
to	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
surprised	1
at	1
something	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
surprised	1
at.	1
Another,	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
officer,	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
everyone,	1
conjecturing	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
being	1
taken	1
and	1
how	1
far	1
they	1
would	1
get	1
that	1
day.	1
An	1
official	1
in	1
felt	1
boots	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
commissariat	1
uniform	1
ran	1
round	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
loudly	1
announcing	1
his	1
observations	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
burned	1
down	1
and	1
what	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
see.	1
A	1
third	1
officer,	1
who	1
by	1
his	1
accent	1
was	1
a	1
Pole,	1
disputed	1
with	1
the	1
commissariat	1
officer,	1
arguing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mistaken	1
in	1
his	1
identification	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
wards	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
disputing	1
about?"	1
said	1
the	1
major	1
angrily.	1
"What	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
St.	1
Nicholas	1
or	1
St.	1
Blasius?	1
You	1
see	1
it's	1
burned	1
down,	1
and	1
there's	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it....	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
pushing	1
for?	1
Isn't	1
the	1
road	1
wide	1
enough?"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
behind	1
him	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
pushing	1
him	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
oh,	1
oh!	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
done?"	1
the	1
prisoners	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
another	1
were	1
heard	1
saying	1
as	1
they	1
gazed	1
on	1
the	1
charred	1
ruins.	1
"All	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
Zubova,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin....	1
Just	1
look!	1
There's	1
not	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
left.	1
Yes,	1
I	1
told	1
you--the	1
whole	1
quarter	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know	1
it's	1
burned,	1
so	1
what's	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking?"	1
said	1
the	1
major.	1
	1
As	1
they	1
passed	1
near	1
a	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
Khamovniki	1
(one	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
unburned	1
quarters	1
of	1
Moscow)	1
the	1
whole	1
mass	1
of	1
prisoners	1
suddenly	1
started	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
exclamations	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
disgust	1
were	1
heard.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
the	1
villains!	1
What	1
heathens!	1
Yes;	1
dead,	1
dead,	1
so	1
he	1
is...	1
And	1
smeared	1
with	1
something!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
too	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
church	1
where	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
that	1
evoked	1
these	1
exclamations,	1
and	1
dimly	1
made	1
out	1
something	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
palings	1
surrounding	1
the	1
church.	1
From	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
who	1
saw	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
did,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
set	1
upright	1
against	1
the	1
palings	1
with	1
its	1
face	1
smeared	1
with	1
soot.	1
	1
"Go	1
on!	1
What	1
the	1
devil...	1
Go	1
on!	1
Thirty	1
thousand	1
devils!..."	1
the	1
convoy	1
guards	1
began	1
cursing	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers,	1
with	1
fresh	1
virulence,	1
drove	1
away	1
with	1
their	1
swords	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
prisoners	1
who	1
were	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
man.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
cross	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
Khamovniki	1
quarter	1
the	1
prisoners	1
marched,	1
followed	1
only	1
by	1
their	1
escort	1
and	1
the	1
vehicles	1
and	1
wagons	1
belonging	1
to	1
that	1
escort,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
supply	1
stores	1
they	1
came	1
among	1
a	1
huge	1
and	1
closely	1
packed	1
train	1
of	1
artillery	1
mingled	1
with	1
private	1
vehicles.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
bridge	1
they	1
all	1
halted,	1
waiting	1
for	1
those	1
in	1
front	1
to	1
get	1
across.	1
From	1
the	1
bridge	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
endless	1
lines	1
of	1
moving	1
baggage	1
trains	1
before	1
and	1
behind	1
them.	1
To	1
the	1
right,	1
where	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
turns	1
near	1
Neskuchny,	1
endless	1
rows	1
of	1
troops	1
and	1
carts	1
stretched	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
distance.	1
These	1
were	1
troops	1
of	1
Beauharnais'	1
corps	1
which	1
had	1
started	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
Behind,	1
along	1
the	1
riverside	1
and	1
across	1
the	1
Stone	1
Bridge,	1
were	1
Ney's	1
troops	1
and	1
transport.	1
	1
Davout's	1
troops,	1
in	1
whose	1
charge	1
were	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
were	1
crossing	1
the	1
Crimean	1
bridge	1
and	1
some	1
were	1
already	1
debouching	1
into	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
But	1
the	1
baggage	1
trains	1
stretched	1
out	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
Beauharnais'	1
train	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
when	1
the	1
vanguard	1
of	1
Ney's	1
army	1
was	1
already	1
emerging	1
from	1
the	1
Great	1
Ordynka	1
Street.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
Crimean	1
bridge	1
the	1
prisoners	1
moved	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
forward,	1
halted,	1
and	1
again	1
moved	1
on,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
vehicles	1
and	1
men	1
crowded	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
together.	1
They	1
advanced	1
the	1
few	1
hundred	1
paces	1
that	1
separated	1
the	1
bridge	1
from	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
taking	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
hour	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
square	1
where	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
Transmoskva	1
ward	1
and	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
converge,	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
jammed	1
close	1
together	1
had	1
to	1
stand	1
for	1
some	1
hours	1
at	1
that	1
crossway.	1
From	1
all	1
sides,	1
like	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
were	1
heard	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
wheels,	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
feet,	1
and	1
incessant	1
shouts	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
abuse.	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
pressed	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
a	1
charred	1
house,	1
listening	1
to	1
that	1
noise	1
which	1
mingled	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
with	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
drums.	1
	1
To	1
get	1
a	1
better	1
view,	1
several	1
officer	1
prisoners	1
climbed	1
onto	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
half-burned	1
house	1
against	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
leaning.	1
	1
"What	1
crowds!	1
Just	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
crowds!...	1
They've	1
loaded	1
goods	1
even	1
on	1
the	1
cannon!	1
Look	1
there,	1
those	1
are	1
furs!"	1
they	1
exclaimed.	1
"Just	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
blackguards	1
have	1
looted....	1
There!	1
See	1
what	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
behind	1
in	1
the	1
cart....	1
Why,	1
those	1
are	1
settings	1
taken	1
from	1
some	1
icons,	1
by	1
heaven!...	1
Oh,	1
the	1
rascals!...	1
See	1
how	1
that	1
fellow	1
has	1
loaded	1
himself	1
up,	1
he	1
can	1
hardly	1
walk!	1
Good	1
lord,	1
they've	1
even	1
grabbed	1
those	1
chaises!...	1
See	1
that	1
fellow	1
there	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
trunks....	1
Heavens!	1
They're	1
fighting."	1
	1
"That's	1
right,	1
hit	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
snout--on	1
his	1
snout!	1
Like	1
this,	1
we	1
shan't	1
get	1
away	1
before	1
evening.	1
Look,	1
look	1
there....	1
Why,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
Napoleon's	1
own.	1
See	1
what	1
horses!	1
And	1
the	1
monograms	1
with	1
a	1
crown!	1
It's	1
like	1
a	1
portable	1
house....	1
That	1
fellow's	1
dropped	1
his	1
sack	1
and	1
doesn't	1
see	1
it.	1
Fighting	1
again...	1
A	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
baby,	1
and	1
not	1
bad-looking	1
either!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
they'll	1
let	1
you	1
pass...	1
Just	1
look,	1
there's	1
no	1
end	1
to	1
it.	1
Russian	1
wenches,	1
by	1
heaven,	1
so	1
they	1
are!	1
In	1
carriages--see	1
how	1
comfortably	1
they've	1
settled	1
themselves!"	1
	1
Again,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Khamovniki,	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
general	1
curiosity	1
bore	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
forward	1
onto	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
stature,	1
saw	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
what	1
so	1
attracted	1
their	1
curiosity.	1
In	1
three	1
carriages	1
involved	1
among	1
the	1
munition	1
carts,	1
closely	1
squeezed	1
together,	1
sat	1
women	1
with	1
rouged	1
faces,	1
dressed	1
in	1
glaring	1
colors,	1
who	1
were	1
shouting	1
something	1
in	1
shrill	1
voices.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
had	1
recognized	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
mysterious	1
force	1
nothing	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
strange	1
or	1
dreadful:	1
neither	1
the	1
corpse	1
smeared	1
with	1
soot	1
for	1
fun	1
nor	1
these	1
women	1
hurrying	1
away	1
nor	1
the	1
burned	1
ruins	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
All	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
witnessed	1
scarcely	1
made	1
an	1
impression	1
on	1
him--as	1
if	1
his	1
soul,	1
making	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
hard	1
struggle,	1
refused	1
to	1
receive	1
impressions	1
that	1
might	1
weaken	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
women's	1
vehicles	1
drove	1
by.	1
Behind	1
them	1
came	1
more	1
carts,	1
soldiers,	1
wagons,	1
soldiers,	1
gun	1
carriages,	1
carriages,	1
soldiers,	1
ammunition	1
carts,	1
more	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
women.	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
individuals	1
but	1
saw	1
their	1
movement.	1
	1
All	1
these	1
people	1
and	1
horses	1
seemed	1
driven	1
forward	1
by	1
some	1
invisible	1
power.	1
During	1
the	1
hour	1
Pierre	1
watched	1
them	1
they	1
all	1
came	1
flowing	1
from	1
the	1
different	1
streets	1
with	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
desire	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
quickly;	1
they	1
all	1
jostled	1
one	1
another,	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
angry	1
and	1
to	1
fight,	1
white	1
teeth	1
gleamed,	1
brows	1
frowned,	1
ever	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
of	1
abuse	1
flew	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
bore	1
the	1
same	1
swaggeringly	1
resolute	1
and	1
coldly	1
cruel	1
expression	1
that	1
had	1
struck	1
Pierre	1
that	1
morning	1
on	1
the	1
corporal's	1
face	1
when	1
the	1
drums	1
were	1
beating.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
nearly	1
evening	1
that	1
the	1
officer	1
commanding	1
the	1
escort	1
collected	1
his	1
men	1
and	1
with	1
shouts	1
and	1
quarrels	1
forced	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
baggage	1
trains,	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
hemmed	1
in	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
emerged	1
onto	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
	1
They	1
marched	1
very	1
quickly,	1
without	1
resting,	1
and	1
halted	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
began	1
to	1
set.	1
The	1
baggage	1
carts	1
drew	1
up	1
close	1
together	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
their	1
night's	1
rest.	1
They	1
all	1
appeared	1
angry	1
and	1
dissatisfied.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
oaths,	1
angry	1
shouts,	1
and	1
fighting	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
all	1
sides.	1
A	1
carriage	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
escort	1
ran	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
carts	1
and	1
knocked	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
it	1
with	1
its	1
pole.	1
Several	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
toward	1
the	1
cart	1
from	1
different	1
sides:	1
some	1
beat	1
the	1
carriage	1
horses	1
on	1
their	1
heads,	1
turning	1
them	1
aside,	1
others	1
fought	1
among	1
themselves,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
one	1
German	1
was	1
badly	1
wounded	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
by	1
a	1
sword.	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
men,	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
stopped	1
amid	1
fields	1
in	1
the	1
chill	1
dusk	1
of	1
the	1
autumn	1
evening,	1
experienced	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
unpleasant	1
awakening	1
from	1
the	1
hurry	1
and	1
eagerness	1
to	1
push	1
on	1
that	1
had	1
seized	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
start.	1
Once	1
at	1
a	1
standstill	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
going,	1
and	1
that	1
much	1
that	1
was	1
painful	1
and	1
difficult	1
awaited	1
them	1
on	1
this	1
journey.	1
	1
During	1
this	1
halt	1
the	1
escort	1
treated	1
the	1
prisoners	1
even	1
worse	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
the	1
start.	1
It	1
was	1
here	1
that	1
the	1
prisoners	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
received	1
horseflesh	1
for	1
their	1
meat	1
ration.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
officer	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
soldier	1
they	1
showed	1
what	1
seemed	1
like	1
personal	1
spite	1
against	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
in	1
unexpected	1
contrast	1
to	1
their	1
former	1
friendly	1
relations.	1
	1
This	1
spite	1
increased	1
still	1
more	1
when,	1
on	1
calling	1
over	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
prisoners,	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
bustle	1
of	1
leaving	1
Moscow	1
one	1
Russian	1
soldier,	1
who	1
had	1
pretended	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
colic,	1
had	1
escaped.	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
beat	1
a	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
cruelly	1
for	1
straying	1
too	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
captain	1
reprimand	1
and	1
threaten	1
to	1
court-	1
martial	1
a	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
the	1
Russian.	1
To	1
the	1
noncommissioned	1
officer's	1
excuse	1
that	1
the	1
prisoner	1
was	1
ill	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
walk,	1
the	1
officer	1
replied	1
that	1
the	1
order	1
was	1
to	1
shoot	1
those	1
who	1
lagged	1
behind.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
that	1
fatal	1
force	1
which	1
had	1
crushed	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
executions,	1
but	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
felt	1
during	1
his	1
imprisonment,	1
now	1
again	1
controlled	1
his	1
existence.	1
It	1
was	1
terrible,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
that	1
fatal	1
force	1
to	1
crush	1
him,	1
there	1
grew	1
and	1
strengthened	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
life	1
independent	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
He	1
ate	1
his	1
supper	1
of	1
buckwheat	1
soup	1
with	1
horseflesh	1
and	1
chatted	1
with	1
his	1
comrades.	1
	1
Neither	1
Pierre	1
nor	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
spoke	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
roughness	1
of	1
their	1
treatment	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
shoot	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
announced	1
to	1
them.	1
As	1
if	1
in	1
reaction	1
against	1
the	1
worsening	1
of	1
their	1
position	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
particularly	1
animated	1
and	1
gay.	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
personal	1
reminiscences,	1
of	1
amusing	1
scenes	1
they	1
had	1
witnessed	1
during	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
avoided	1
all	1
talk	1
of	1
their	1
present	1
situation.	1
	1
The	1
sun	1
had	1
set	1
long	1
since.	1
Bright	1
stars	1
shone	1
out	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
A	1
red	1
glow	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
conflagration	1
spread	1
above	1
the	1
horizon	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
full	1
moon,	1
and	1
that	1
vast	1
red	1
ball	1
swayed	1
strangely	1
in	1
the	1
gray	1
haze.	1
It	1
grew	1
light.	1
The	1
evening	1
was	1
ending,	1
but	1
the	1
night	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
Pierre	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
his	1
new	1
companions,	1
crossing	1
between	1
the	1
campfires	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
the	1
common	1
soldier	1
prisoners	1
were	1
stationed.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
them.	1
On	1
the	1
road	1
he	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
sentinel	1
who	1
ordered	1
him	1
back.	1
	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
back,	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
companions	1
by	1
the	1
campfire,	1
but	1
to	1
an	1
unharnessed	1
cart	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
nobody.	1
Tucking	1
his	1
legs	1
under	1
him	1
and	1
dropping	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
cold	1
ground	1
by	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
remained	1
motionless	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
sunk	1
in	1
thought.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
burst	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
his	1
broad,	1
good-natured	1
laughter,	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
men	1
from	1
various	1
sides	1
turned	1
with	1
surprise	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
this	1
strange	1
and	1
evidently	1
solitary	1
laughter	1
could	1
mean.	1
	1
"Ha-ha-ha!"	1
laughed	1
Pierre.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
to	1
himself:	1
"The	1
soldier	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
pass.	1
They	1
took	1
me	1
and	1
shut	1
me	1
up.	1
They	1
hold	1
me	1
captive.	1
What,	1
me?	1
Me?	1
My	1
immortal	1
soul?	1
Ha-ha-ha!	1
Ha-ha-ha!..."	1
and	1
he	1
laughed	1
till	1
tears	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
A	1
man	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
this	1
queer	1
big	1
fellow	1
was	1
laughing	1
at	1
all	1
by	1
himself.	1
Pierre	1
stopped	1
laughing,	1
got	1
up,	1
went	1
farther	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
inquisitive	1
man,	1
and	1
looked	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
huge,	1
endless	1
bivouac	1
that	1
had	1
previously	1
resounded	1
with	1
the	1
crackling	1
of	1
campfires	1
and	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
many	1
men	1
had	1
grown	1
quiet,	1
the	1
red	1
campfires	1
were	1
growing	1
paler	1
and	1
dying	1
down.	1
High	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
sky	1
hung	1
the	1
full	1
moon.	1
Forests	1
and	1
fields	1
beyond	1
the	1
camp,	1
unseen	1
before,	1
were	1
now	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
And	1
farther	1
still,	1
beyond	1
those	1
forests	1
and	1
fields,	1
the	1
bright,	1
oscillating,	1
limitless	1
distance	1
lured	1
one	1
to	1
itself.	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
the	1
twinkling	1
stars	1
in	1
its	1
faraway	1
depths.	1
"And	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
me,	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
me,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
I!"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"And	1
they	1
caught	1
all	1
that	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
shed	1
boarded	1
up	1
with	1
planks!"	1
He	1
smiled,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
to	1
sleep	1
beside	1
his	1
companions.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
In	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
October	1
another	1
envoy	1
came	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Napoleon	1
proposing	1
peace	1
and	1
falsely	1
dated	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
though	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
already	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Kutuzov	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
Kutuzov	1
replied	1
to	1
this	1
letter	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
formerly	1
brought	1
by	1
Lauriston,	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
that	1
a	1
report	1
was	1
received	1
from	1
Dorokhov's	1
guerrilla	1
detachment	1
operating	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
Tarutino	1
that	1
troops	1
of	1
Broussier's	1
division	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
at	1
Forminsk	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
they	1
might	1
easily	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
again	1
demanded	1
action.	1
Generals	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
excited	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
easy	1
victory	1
at	1
Tarutino,	1
urged	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
Dorokhov's	1
suggestion.	1
Kutuzov	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
any	1
offensive	1
necessary.	1
The	1
result	1
was	1
a	1
compromise	1
which	1
was	1
inevitable:	1
a	1
small	1
detachment	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
Forminsk	1
to	1
attack	1
Broussier.	1
	1
By	1
a	1
strange	1
coincidence,	1
this	1
task,	1
which	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
difficult	1
and	1
important	1
one,	1
was	1
entrusted	1
to	1
Dokhturov--that	1
same	1
modest	1
little	1
Dokhturov	1
whom	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
described	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
drawing	1
up	1
plans	1
of	1
battles,	1
dashing	1
about	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
regiments,	1
showering	1
crosses	1
on	1
batteries,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
undecided	1
and	1
undiscerning--but	1
whom	1
we	1
find	1
commanding	1
wherever	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
most	1
difficult	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
Russo-French	1
wars	1
from	1
Austerlitz	1
to	1
the	1
year	1
1813.	1
At	1
Austerlitz	1
he	1
remained	1
last	1
at	1
the	1
Augezd	1
dam,	1
rallying	1
the	1
regiments,	1
saving	1
what	1
was	1
possible	1
when	1
all	1
were	1
flying	1
and	1
perishing	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
general	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
guard.	1
Ill	1
with	1
fever	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Smolensk	1
with	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
men	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
town	1
against	1
Napoleon's	1
whole	1
army.	1
In	1
Smolensk,	1
at	1
the	1
Malakhov	1
Gate,	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
dozed	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
paroxysm	1
of	1
fever	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
the	1
bombardment	1
of	1
the	1
town--and	1
Smolensk	1
held	1
out	1
all	1
day	1
long.	1
At	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
when	1
Bagration	1
was	1
killed	1
and	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
our	1
left	1
flank	1
had	1
fallen	1
and	1
the	1
full	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
artillery	1
fire	1
was	1
directed	1
against	1
it,	1
the	1
man	1
sent	1
there	1
was	1
this	1
same	1
irresolute	1
and	1
undiscerning	1
Dokhturov--Kutuzov	1
hastening	1
to	1
rectify	1
a	1
mistake	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
by	1
sending	1
someone	1
else	1
there	1
first.	1
And	1
the	1
quiet	1
little	1
Dokhturov	1
rode	1
thither,	1
and	1
Borodino	1
became	1
the	1
greatest	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army.	1
Many	1
heroes	1
have	1
been	1
described	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
verse	1
and	1
prose,	1
but	1
of	1
Dokhturov	1
scarcely	1
a	1
word	1
has	1
been	1
said.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
Dokhturov	1
again	1
whom	1
they	1
sent	1
to	1
Forminsk	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
to	1
Malo-Yaroslavets,	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
last	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
fought	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
obvious	1
disintegration	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
began;	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
told	1
of	1
many	1
geniuses	1
and	1
heroes	1
of	1
that	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
but	1
of	1
Dokhturov	1
nothing	1
or	1
very	1
little	1
is	1
said	1
and	1
that	1
dubiously.	1
And	1
this	1
silence	1
about	1
Dokhturov	1
is	1
the	1
clearest	1
testimony	1
to	1
his	1
merit.	1
	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
workings	1
of	1
a	1
machine	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
a	1
shaving	1
that	1
has	1
fallen	1
into	1
it	1
by	1
chance	1
and	1
is	1
interfering	1
with	1
its	1
action	1
and	1
tossing	1
about	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
its	1
most	1
important	1
part.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
machine	1
cannot	1
conceive	1
that	1
the	1
small	1
connecting	1
cogwheel	1
which	1
revolves	1
quietly	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
essential	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
machine,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
shaving	1
which	1
merely	1
harms	1
and	1
hinders	1
the	1
working.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
October	1
when	1
Dokhturov	1
had	1
gone	1
halfway	1
to	1
Forminsk	1
and	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Aristovo,	1
preparing	1
faithfully	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
orders	1
he	1
had	1
received,	1
the	1
whole	1
French	1
army	1
having,	1
in	1
its	1
convulsive	1
movement,	1
reached	1
Murat's	1
position	1
apparently	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
battle--	1
suddenly	1
without	1
any	1
reason	1
turned	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
onto	1
the	1
new	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
enter	1
Forminsk,	1
where	1
only	1
Broussier	1
had	1
been	1
till	1
then.	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Dokhturov	1
had	1
under	1
his	1
command,	1
besides	1
Dorokhov's	1
detachment,	1
the	1
two	1
small	1
guerrilla	1
detachments	1
of	1
Figner	1
and	1
Seslavin.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
October	1
11	1
Seslavin	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Aristovo	1
headquarters	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
guardsman	1
he	1
had	1
captured.	1
The	1
prisoner	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
troops	1
that	1
had	1
entered	1
Forminsk	1
that	1
day	1
were	1
the	1
vanguard	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
there	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow	1
four	1
days	1
previously.	1
That	1
same	1
evening	1
a	1
house	1
serf	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Borovsk	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
an	1
immense	1
army	1
entering	1
the	1
town.	1
Some	1
Cossacks	1
of	1
Dokhturov's	1
detachment	1
reported	1
having	1
sighted	1
the	1
French	1
Guards	1
marching	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Borovsk.	1
From	1
all	1
these	1
reports	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
single	1
division	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
whole	1
French	1
army	1
marching	1
from	1
Moscow	1
in	1
an	1
unexpected	1
direction--along	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
Dokhturov	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
undertake	1
any	1
action,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
clear	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
attack	1
Forminsk.	1
But	1
only	1
Broussier	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
whole	1
French	1
army	1
was	1
there.	1
Ermolov	1
wished	1
to	1
act	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
judgment,	1
but	1
Dokhturov	1
insisted	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
Kutuzov's	1
instructions.	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
dispatch	1
to	1
the	1
staff.	1
	1
For	1
this	1
purpose	1
a	1
capable	1
officer,	1
Bolkhovitinov,	1
was	1
chosen,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
by	1
word	1
of	1
mouth,	1
besides	1
delivering	1
a	1
written	1
report.	1
Toward	1
midnight	1
Bolkhovitinov,	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
dispatch	1
and	1
verbal	1
instructions,	1
galloped	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
General	1
Staff	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
Cossack	1
with	1
spare	1
horses.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
warm,	1
dark,	1
autumn	1
night.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
raining	1
for	1
four	1
days.	1
Having	1
changed	1
horses	1
twice	1
and	1
galloped	1
twenty	1
miles	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
over	1
a	1
sticky,	1
muddy	1
road,	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
reached	1
Litashevka	1
after	1
one	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night.	1
Dismounting	1
at	1
a	1
cottage	1
on	1
whose	1
wattle	1
fence	1
hung	1
a	1
signboard,	1
GENERAL	1
STAFF,	1
and	1
throwing	1
down	1
his	1
reins,	1
he	1
entered	1
a	1
dark	1
passage.	1
	1
"The	1
general	1
on	1
duty,	1
quick!	1
It's	1
very	1
important!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
was	1
sniffing	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
passage.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
unwell	1
since	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
night	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
slept,"	1
said	1
the	1
orderly	1
pleadingly	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
"You	1
should	1
wake	1
the	1
captain	1
first."	1
	1
"But	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
important,	1
from	1
General	1
Dokhturov,"	1
said	1
Bolkhovitinov,	1
entering	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
by	1
feeling	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
	1
The	1
orderly	1
had	1
gone	1
in	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
waking	1
somebody.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
your	1
honor!	1
A	1
courier."	1
	1
"What?	1
What's	1
that?	1
From	1
whom?"	1
came	1
a	1
sleepy	1
voice.	1
	1
"From	1
Dokhturov	1
and	1
from	1
Alexey	1
Petrovich.	1
Napoleon	1
is	1
at	1
Forminsk,"	1
said	1
Bolkhovitinov,	1
unable	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
who	1
was	1
speaking	1
but	1
guessing	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Konovnitsyn.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
wakened	1
yawned	1
and	1
stretched	1
himself.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
waking	1
him,"	1
he	1
said,	1
fumbling	1
for	1
something.	1
"He	1
is	1
very	1
ill.	1
Perhaps	1
this	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
rumor."	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
the	1
dispatch,"	1
said	1
Bolkhovitinov.	1
"My	1
orders	1
are	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
on	1
duty."	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
I'll	1
light	1
a	1
candle.	1
You	1
damned	1
rascal,	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
always	1
hide	1
it?"	1
said	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
stretching	1
himself,	1
to	1
the	1
orderly.	1
(This	1
was	1
Shcherbinin,	1
Konovnitsyn's	1
adjutant.)	1
"I've	1
found	1
it,	1
I've	1
found	1
it!"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
The	1
orderly	1
was	1
striking	1
a	1
light	1
and	1
Shcherbinin	1
was	1
fumbling	1
for	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
candlestick.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
nasty	1
beasts!"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
disgust.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sparks	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
saw	1
Shcherbinin's	1
youthful	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
candle,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
another	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
asleep.	1
This	1
was	1
Konovnitsyn.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
the	1
sulphur	1
splinters	1
kindled	1
by	1
the	1
tinder	1
burned	1
up,	1
first	1
blue	1
and	1
then	1
red,	1
Shcherbinin	1
lit	1
the	1
tallow	1
candle,	1
from	1
the	1
candlestick	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
cockroaches	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
gnawing	1
it	1
were	1
running	1
away,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
messenger.	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
was	1
bespattered	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
mud	1
and	1
had	1
smeared	1
his	1
face	1
by	1
wiping	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
sleeve.	1
	1
"Who	1
gave	1
the	1
report?"	1
inquired	1
Shcherbinin,	1
taking	1
the	1
envelope.	1
	1
"The	1
news	1
is	1
reliable,"	1
said	1
Bolkhovitinov.	1
"Prisoners,	1
Cossacks,	1
and	1
the	1
scouts	1
all	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
thing."	1
	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
we'll	1
have	1
to	1
wake	1
him,"	1
said	1
Shcherbinin,	1
rising	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
nightcap	1
who	1
lay	1
covered	1
by	1
a	1
greatcoat.	1
"Peter	1
Petrovich!"	1
said	1
he.	1
(Konovnitsyn	1
did	1
not	1
stir.)	1
"To	1
the	1
General	1
Staff!"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
knowing	1
that	1
those	1
words	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
arouse	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
in	1
fact	1
the	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
nightcap	1
was	1
lifted	1
at	1
once.	1
On	1
Konovnitsyn's	1
handsome,	1
resolute	1
face	1
with	1
cheeks	1
flushed	1
by	1
fever,	1
there	1
still	1
remained	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
a	1
faraway	1
dreamy	1
expression	1
remote	1
from	1
present	1
affairs,	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
started	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
its	1
habitual	1
calm	1
and	1
firm	1
appearance.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
is	1
it?	1
From	1
whom?"	1
he	1
asked	1
immediately	1
but	1
without	1
hurry,	1
blinking	1
at	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
While	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
officer's	1
report	1
Konovnitsyn	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
dispatch.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
he	1
done	1
so	1
before	1
he	1
lowered	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
their	1
woolen	1
stockings	1
to	1
the	1
earthen	1
floor	1
and	1
began	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
boots.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
nightcap,	1
combed	1
his	1
hair	1
over	1
his	1
temples,	1
and	1
donned	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
get	1
here	1
quickly?	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
Highness."	1
	1
Konovnitsyn	1
had	1
understood	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
the	1
news	1
brought	1
was	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
time	1
must	1
be	1
lost.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
or	1
ask	1
himself	1
whether	1
the	1
news	1
was	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
That	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him.	1
He	1
regarded	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
intelligence	1
or	1
his	1
reason	1
but	1
by	1
something	1
else.	1
There	1
was	1
within	1
him	1
a	1
deep	1
unexpressed	1
conviction	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well,	1
but	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
not	1
trust	1
to	1
this	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
speak	1
about	1
it,	1
but	1
must	1
only	1
attend	1
to	1
one's	1
own	1
work.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
his	1
work,	1
giving	1
his	1
whole	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
task.	1
	1
Peter	1
Petrovich	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
like	1
Dokhturov,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
included	1
merely	1
for	1
propriety's	1
sake	1
in	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
so-called	1
heroes	1
of	1
1812-	1
-the	1
Barclays,	1
Raevskis,	1
Ermolovs,	1
Platovs,	1
and	1
Miloradoviches.	1
Like	1
Dokhturov	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
limited	1
capacity	1
and	1
information,	1
and	1
like	1
Dokhturov	1
he	1
never	1
made	1
plans	1
of	1
battle	1
but	1
was	1
always	1
found	1
where	1
the	1
situation	1
was	1
most	1
difficult.	1
Since	1
his	1
appointment	1
as	1
general	1
on	1
duty	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
door	1
open,	1
giving	1
orders	1
that	1
every	1
messenger	1
should	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
wake	1
him	1
up.	1
In	1
battle	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
under	1
fire,	1
so	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
reproved	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
feared	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
and	1
like	1
Dokhturov	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
unnoticed	1
cogwheels	1
that,	1
without	1
clatter	1
or	1
noise,	1
constitute	1
the	1
most	1
essential	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
machine.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
into	1
the	1
damp,	1
dark	1
night	1
Konovnitsyn	1
frowned--	1
partly	1
from	1
an	1
increased	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
partly	1
at	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
thought	1
that	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
of	1
how	1
all	1
that	1
nest	1
of	1
influential	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
would	1
be	1
stirred	1
up	1
by	1
this	1
news,	1
especially	1
Bennigsen,	1
who	1
ever	1
since	1
Tarutino	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
daggers	1
drawn	1
with	1
Kutuzov;	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
make	1
suggestions,	1
quarrel,	1
issue	1
orders,	1
and	1
rescind	1
them.	1
And	1
this	1
premonition	1
was	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
helped.	1
	1
And	1
in	1
fact	1
Toll,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
communicate	1
the	1
news,	1
immediately	1
began	1
to	1
expound	1
his	1
plans	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
sharing	1
his	1
quarters,	1
until	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
who	1
listened	1
in	1
weary	1
silence,	1
reminded	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
Highness.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
like	1
all	1
old	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
much	1
at	1
night.	1
He	1
often	1
fell	1
asleep	1
unexpectedly	1
in	1
the	1
daytime,	1
but	1
at	1
night,	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
without	1
undressing,	1
he	1
generally	1
remained	1
awake	1
thinking.	1
	1
So	1
he	1
lay	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
bed,	1
supporting	1
his	1
large,	1
heavy,	1
scarred	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
plump	1
hand,	1
with	1
his	1
one	1
eye	1
open,	1
meditating	1
and	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
Since	1
Bennigsen,	1
who	1
corresponded	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
had	1
more	1
influence	1
than	1
anyone	1
else	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
avoid	1
him,	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
more	1
at	1
ease	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
troops	1
being	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
useless	1
aggressive	1
movements.	1
The	1
lesson	1
of	1
the	1
Tarutino	1
battle	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
it,	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
remembered	1
with	1
pain,	1
must,	1
he	1
thought,	1
have	1
some	1
effect	1
on	1
others	1
too.	1
	1
"They	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
only	1
lose	1
by	1
taking	1
the	1
offensive.	1
Patience	1
and	1
time	1
are	1
my	1
warriors,	1
my	1
champions,"	1
thought	1
Kutuzov.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
an	1
apple	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
plucked	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
green.	1
It	1
will	1
fall	1
of	1
itself	1
when	1
ripe,	1
but	1
if	1
picked	1
unripe	1
the	1
apple	1
is	1
spoiled,	1
the	1
tree	1
is	1
harmed,	1
and	1
your	1
teeth	1
are	1
set	1
on	1
edge.	1
Like	1
an	1
experienced	1
sportsman	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
wounded,	1
and	1
wounded	1
as	1
only	1
the	1
whole	1
strength	1
of	1
Russia	1
could	1
have	1
wounded	1
it,	1
but	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
mortally	1
wounded	1
or	1
not	1
was	1
still	1
an	1
undecided	1
question.	1
Now	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
Lauriston	1
and	1
Barthelemi	1
having	1
been	1
sent,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
guerrillas,	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
almost	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
wound	1
was	1
mortal.	1
But	1
he	1
needed	1
further	1
proofs	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
wait.	1
	1
"They	1
want	1
to	1
run	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
have	1
wounded	1
it.	1
Wait	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see!	1
Continual	1
maneuvers,	1
continual	1
advances!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"What	1
for?	1
Only	1
to	1
distinguish	1
themselves!	1
As	1
if	1
fighting	1
were	1
fun.	1
They	1
are	1
like	1
children	1
from	1
whom	1
one	1
can't	1
get	1
any	1
sensible	1
account	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
because	1
they	1
all	1
want	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
well	1
they	1
can	1
fight.	1
But	1
that's	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
needed	1
now.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
ingenious	1
maneuvers	1
they	1
all	1
propose	1
to	1
me!	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
contingencies"	1
(he	1
remembered	1
the	1
general	1
plan	1
sent	1
him	1
from	1
Petersburg)	1
"they	1
have	1
foreseen	1
everything.	1
But	1
the	1
contingencies	1
are	1
endless."	1
	1
The	1
undecided	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
the	1
wound	1
inflicted	1
at	1
Borodino	1
was	1
mortal	1
or	1
not	1
had	1
hung	1
over	1
Kutuzov's	1
head	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
month.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
occupied	1
Moscow.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
Kutuzov	1
felt	1
assured	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
being	1
that	1
the	1
terrible	1
blow	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
put	1
their	1
whole	1
strength	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
mortal.	1
But	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
proofs	1
were	1
needed;	1
he	1
had	1
waited	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
grew	1
more	1
impatient	1
the	1
longer	1
he	1
waited.	1
Lying	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
during	1
those	1
sleepless	1
nights	1
he	1
did	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
reproached	1
those	1
younger	1
generals	1
for	1
doing.	1
He	1
imagined	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
possible	1
contingencies,	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
younger	1
men,	1
but	1
with	1
this	1
difference,	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
thousands	1
of	1
contingencies	1
instead	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
and	1
based	1
nothing	1
on	1
them.	1
The	1
longer	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
more	1
contingencies	1
presented	1
themselves.	1
He	1
imagined	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Napoleonic	1
army	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
or	1
in	1
sections--against	1
Petersburg,	1
or	1
against	1
him,	1
or	1
to	1
outflank	1
him.	1
He	1
thought	1
too	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
(which	1
he	1
feared	1
most	1
of	1
all)	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
might	1
fight	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
weapon	1
and	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow	1
awaiting	1
him.	1
Kutuzov	1
even	1
imagined	1
that	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
might	1
turn	1
back	1
through	1
Medyn	1
and	1
Yukhnov,	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
foresee	1
was	1
what	1
happened--the	1
insane,	1
convulsive	1
stampede	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
during	1
its	1
first	1
eleven	1
days	1
after	1
leaving	1
Moscow:	1
a	1
stampede	1
which	1
made	1
possible	1
what	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
even	1
dared	1
to	1
think	1
of--the	1
complete	1
extermination	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
Dorokhov's	1
report	1
about	1
Broussier's	1
division,	1
the	1
guerrillas'	1
reports	1
of	1
distress	1
in	1
Napoleon's	1
army,	1
rumors	1
of	1
preparations	1
for	1
leaving	1
Moscow,	1
all	1
confirmed	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
was	1
beaten	1
and	1
preparing	1
for	1
flight.	1
But	1
these	1
were	1
only	1
suppositions,	1
which	1
seemed	1
important	1
to	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
With	1
his	1
sixty	1
years'	1
experience	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
value	1
to	1
attach	1
to	1
rumors,	1
knew	1
how	1
apt	1
people	1
who	1
desire	1
anything	1
are	1
to	1
group	1
all	1
news	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
confirm	1
what	1
they	1
desire,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
readily	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
they	1
omit	1
all	1
that	1
makes	1
for	1
the	1
contrary.	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
desired	1
it	1
the	1
less	1
he	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
believe	1
it.	1
This	1
question	1
absorbed	1
all	1
his	1
mental	1
powers.	1
All	1
else	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
only	1
life's	1
customary	1
routine.	1
To	1
such	1
customary	1
routine	1
belonged	1
his	1
conversations	1
with	1
the	1
staff,	1
the	1
letters	1
he	1
wrote	1
from	1
Tarutino	1
to	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
novels,	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
awards,	1
his	1
correspondence	1
with	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
But	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
which	1
he	1
alone	1
foresaw,	1
was	1
his	1
heart's	1
one	1
desire.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
eleventh	1
of	1
October	1
he	1
lay	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
that.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
Toll,	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
and	1
Bolkhovitinov.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
who's	1
there?	1
Come	1
in,	1
come	1
in!	1
What	1
news?"	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
While	1
a	1
footman	1
was	1
lighting	1
a	1
candle,	1
Toll	1
communicated	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
news.	1
	1
"Who	1
brought	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
which,	1
when	1
the	1
candle	1
was	1
lit,	1
struck	1
Toll	1
by	1
its	1
cold	1
severity.	1
	1
"There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
it,	1
your	1
Highness."	1
	1
"Call	1
him	1
in,	1
call	1
him	1
here."	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
hanging	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
paunch	1
resting	1
against	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
was	1
doubled	1
under	1
him.	1
He	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
seeing	1
eye	1
to	1
scrutinize	1
the	1
messenger	1
more	1
carefully,	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
read	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
what	1
preoccupied	1
his	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
tell	1
me,	1
friend,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
in	1
his	1
low,	1
aged	1
voice,	1
as	1
he	1
pulled	1
together	1
the	1
shirt	1
which	1
gaped	1
open	1
on	1
his	1
chest,	1
"come	1
nearer--nearer.	1
What	1
news	1
have	1
you	1
brought	1
me?	1
Eh?	1
That	1
Napoleon	1
has	1
left	1
Moscow?	1
Are	1
you	1
sure?	1
Eh?"	1
	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
gave	1
a	1
detailed	1
account	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
to	1
report.	1
	1
"Speak	1
quicker,	1
quicker!	1
Don't	1
torture	1
me!"	1
Kutuzov	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
and	1
was	1
then	1
silent,	1
awaiting	1
instructions.	1
Toll	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
Kutuzov	1
checked	1
him.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
suddenly	1
puckered	1
and	1
wrinkled;	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arm	1
at	1
Toll	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
to	1
the	1
corner	1
darkened	1
by	1
the	1
icons	1
that	1
hung	1
there.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord,	1
my	1
Creator,	1
Thou	1
has	1
heard	1
our	1
prayer..."	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
tremulous	1
voice	1
with	1
folded	1
hands.	1
"Russia	1
is	1
saved.	1
I	1
thank	1
Thee,	1
O	1
Lord!"	1
and	1
he	1
wept.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
received	1
this	1
news	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
all	1
Kutuzov's	1
activity	1
was	1
directed	1
toward	1
restraining	1
his	1
troops,	1
by	1
authority,	1
by	1
guile,	1
and	1
by	1
entreaty,	1
from	1
useless	1
attacks,	1
maneuvers,	1
or	1
encounters	1
with	1
the	1
perishing	1
enemy.	1
Dokhturov	1
went	1
to	1
Malo-	1
Yaroslavets,	1
but	1
Kutuzov	1
lingered	1
with	1
the	1
main	1
army	1
and	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
evacuation	1
of	1
Kaluga--a	1
retreat	1
beyond	1
which	1
town	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
quite	1
possible.	1
	1
Everywhere	1
Kutuzov	1
retreated,	1
but	1
the	1
enemy	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
retreat	1
fled	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
direction.	1
	1
Napoleon's	1
historians	1
describe	1
to	1
us	1
his	1
skilled	1
maneuvers	1
at	1
Tarutino	1
and	1
Malo-Yaroslavets,	1
and	1
make	1
conjectures	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
Napoleon	1
been	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
penetrate	1
into	1
the	1
rich	1
southern	1
provinces.	1
	1
But	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
nothing	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
advancing	1
into	1
those	1
southern	1
provinces	1
(for	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
did	1
not	1
bar	1
his	1
way),	1
the	1
historians	1
forget	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
have	1
saved	1
his	1
army,	1
for	1
then	1
already	1
it	1
bore	1
within	1
itself	1
the	1
germs	1
of	1
inevitable	1
ruin.	1
How	1
could	1
that	1
army--which	1
had	1
found	1
abundant	1
supplies	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
had	1
trampled	1
them	1
underfoot	1
instead	1
of	1
keeping	1
them,	1
and	1
on	1
arriving	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
had	1
looted	1
provisions	1
instead	1
of	1
storing	1
them--how	1
could	1
that	1
army	1
recuperate	1
in	1
Kaluga	1
province,	1
which	1
was	1
inhabited	1
by	1
Russians	1
such	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
where	1
fire	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
property	1
of	1
consuming	1
what	1
was	1
set	1
ablaze?	1
	1
That	1
army	1
could	1
not	1
recover	1
anywhere.	1
Since	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
pillage	1
of	1
Moscow	1
it	1
had	1
borne	1
within	1
itself,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
the	1
chemical	1
elements	1
of	1
dissolution.	1
	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
an	1
army--Napoleon	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
soldiers	1
fled--without	1
knowing	1
whither,	1
each	1
concerned	1
only	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
escape	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
this	1
position,	1
of	1
the	1
hopelessness	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
vaguely	1
conscious.	1
	1
So	1
it	1
came	1
about	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
council	1
at	1
Malo-Yaroslavets,	1
when	1
the	1
generals	1
pretending	1
to	1
confer	1
together	1
expressed	1
various	1
opinions,	1
all	1
mouths	1
were	1
closed	1
by	1
the	1
opinion	1
uttered	1
by	1
the	1
simple-minded	1
soldier	1
Mouton	1
who,	1
speaking	1
last,	1
said	1
what	1
they	1
all	1
felt:	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
needful	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible;	1
and	1
no	1
one,	1
not	1
even	1
Napoleon,	1
could	1
say	1
anything	1
against	1
that	1
truth	1
which	1
they	1
all	1
recognized.	1
	1
But	1
though	1
they	1
all	1
realized	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
get	1
away,	1
there	1
still	1
remained	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
at	1
admitting	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
flee.	1
An	1
external	1
shock	1
was	1
needed	1
to	1
overcome	1
that	1
shame,	1
and	1
this	1
shock	1
came	1
in	1
due	1
time.	1
It	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
French	1
called	1
"le	1
hourra	1
de	1
l'Empereur."	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
council	1
at	1
Malo-Yaroslavets	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
out	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
amid	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
with	1
his	1
suite	1
of	1
marshals	1
and	1
an	1
escort,	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
inspecting	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
battle.	1
Some	1
Cossacks	1
on	1
the	1
prowl	1
for	1
booty	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
very	1
nearly	1
captured	1
him.	1
If	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
did	1
not	1
capture	1
Napoleon	1
then,	1
what	1
saved	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
destroying	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
the	1
booty	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
fell.	1
Here	1
as	1
at	1
Tarutino	1
they	1
went	1
after	1
plunder,	1
leaving	1
the	1
men.	1
Disregarding	1
Napoleon	1
they	1
rushed	1
after	1
the	1
plunder	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
managed	1
to	1
escape.	1
	1
When	1
les	1
enfants	1
du	1
Don	1
might	1
so	1
easily	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
army,	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
fly	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
possible	1
along	1
the	1
nearest,	1
familiar	1
road.	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
his	1
forty-year-old	1
stomach	1
understood	1
that	1
hint,	1
not	1
feeling	1
his	1
former	1
agility	1
and	1
boldness,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
fright	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
agreed	1
with	1
Mouton	1
and	1
issued	1
orders--	1
as	1
the	1
historians	1
tell	1
us--to	1
retreat	1
by	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road.	1
	1
That	1
Napoleon	1
agreed	1
with	1
Mouton,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
retreated,	1
does	1
not	1
prove	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
retreat,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
forces	1
which	1
influenced	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
and	1
directed	1
it	1
along	1
the	1
Mozhaysk	1
(that	1
is,	1
the	1
Smolensk)	1
road	1
acted	1
simultaneously	1
on	1
him	1
also.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
A	1
man	1
in	1
motion	1
always	1
devises	1
an	1
aim	1
for	1
that	1
motion.	1
To	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
thousand	1
miles	1
he	1
must	1
imagine	1
that	1
something	1
good	1
awaits	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
those	1
thousand	1
miles.	1
One	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
promised	1
land	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
move.	1
	1
The	1
promised	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
during	1
their	1
advance	1
had	1
been	1
Moscow,	1
during	1
their	1
retreat	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
native	1
land.	1
But	1
that	1
native	1
land	1
was	1
too	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
going	1
a	1
thousand	1
miles	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
set	1
aside	1
his	1
final	1
goal	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
himself:	1
"Today	1
I	1
shall	1
get	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
twenty-five	1
miles	1
off	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
rest	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
night,"	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
day's	1
journey	1
that	1
resting	1
place	1
eclipses	1
his	1
ultimate	1
goal	1
and	1
attracts	1
all	1
his	1
hopes	1
and	1
desires.	1
And	1
the	1
impulses	1
felt	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
person	1
are	1
always	1
magnified	1
in	1
a	1
crowd.	1
	1
For	1
the	1
French	1
retreating	1
along	1
the	1
old	1
Smolensk	1
road,	1
the	1
final	1
goal--	1
their	1
native	1
land--was	1
too	1
remote,	1
and	1
their	1
immediate	1
goal	1
was	1
Smolensk,	1
toward	1
which	1
all	1
their	1
desires	1
and	1
hopes,	1
enormously	1
intensified	1
in	1
the	1
mass,	1
urged	1
them	1
on.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
much	1
food	1
and	1
fresh	1
troops	1
awaited	1
them	1
in	1
Smolensk,	1
nor	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
told	1
so	1
(on	1
the	1
contrary	1
their	1
superior	1
officers,	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
himself,	1
knew	1
that	1
provisions	1
were	1
scarce	1
there),	1
but	1
because	1
this	1
alone	1
could	1
give	1
them	1
strength	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
and	1
endure	1
their	1
present	1
privations.	1
So	1
both	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
deceived	1
themselves,	1
and	1
pushed	1
on	1
to	1
Smolensk	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
promised	1
land.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
highroad	1
the	1
French	1
fled	1
with	1
surprising	1
energy	1
and	1
unheard-of	1
rapidity	1
toward	1
the	1
goal	1
they	1
had	1
fixed	1
on.	1
Besides	1
the	1
common	1
impulse	1
which	1
bound	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd	1
of	1
French	1
into	1
one	1
mass	1
and	1
supplied	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
energy,	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
cause	1
binding	1
them	1
together--their	1
great	1
numbers.	1
As	1
with	1
the	1
physical	1
law	1
of	1
gravity,	1
their	1
enormous	1
mass	1
drew	1
the	1
individual	1
human	1
atoms	1
to	1
itself.	1
In	1
their	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
they	1
moved	1
like	1
a	1
whole	1
nation.	1
	1
Each	1
of	1
them	1
desired	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
give	1
himself	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
prisoner	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
all	1
this	1
horror	1
and	1
misery;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
this	1
common	1
attraction	1
to	1
Smolensk,	1
their	1
goal,	1
drew	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction;	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
an	1
army	1
corps	1
could	1
not	1
surrender	1
to	1
a	1
company,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
French	1
availed	1
themselves	1
of	1
every	1
convenient	1
opportunity	1
to	1
detach	1
themselves	1
and	1
to	1
surrender	1
on	1
the	1
slightest	1
decent	1
pretext,	1
such	1
pretexts	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
occur.	1
Their	1
very	1
numbers	1
and	1
their	1
crowded	1
and	1
swift	1
movement	1
deprived	1
them	1
of	1
that	1
possibility	1
and	1
rendered	1
it	1
not	1
only	1
difficult	1
but	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
Russians	1
to	1
stop	1
this	1
movement,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
directing	1
all	1
their	1
energies.	1
Beyond	1
a	1
certain	1
limit	1
no	1
mechanical	1
disruption	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
could	1
hasten	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
decomposition.	1
	1
A	1
lump	1
of	1
snow	1
cannot	1
be	1
melted	1
instantaneously.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
limit	1
of	1
time	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
which	1
no	1
amount	1
of	1
heat	1
can	1
melt	1
the	1
snow.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
heat	1
the	1
more	1
solidified	1
the	1
remaining	1
snow	1
becomes.	1
	1
Of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
Kutuzov	1
alone	1
understood	1
this.	1
When	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
along	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road	1
became	1
well	1
defined,	1
what	1
Konovnitsyn	1
had	1
foreseen	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
eleventh	1
of	1
October	1
began	1
to	1
occur.	1
The	1
superior	1
officers	1
all	1
wanted	1
to	1
distinguish	1
themselves,	1
to	1
cut	1
off,	1
to	1
seize,	1
to	1
capture,	1
and	1
to	1
overthrow	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
all	1
clamored	1
for	1
action.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
alone	1
used	1
all	1
his	1
power	1
(and	1
such	1
power	1
is	1
very	1
limited	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
any	1
commander-in-chief)	1
to	1
prevent	1
an	1
attack.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
them	1
what	1
we	1
say	1
now:	1
"Why	1
fight,	1
why	1
block	1
the	1
road,	1
losing	1
our	1
own	1
men	1
and	1
inhumanly	1
slaughtering	1
unfortunate	1
wretches?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
that,	1
when	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
their	1
army	1
has	1
melted	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Vyazma	1
without	1
any	1
battle?"	1
But	1
drawing	1
from	1
his	1
aged	1
wisdom	1
what	1
they	1
could	1
understand,	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
bridge,	1
and	1
they	1
laughed	1
at	1
and	1
slandered	1
him,	1
flinging	1
themselves	1
on,	1
rending	1
and	1
exulting	1
over	1
the	1
dying	1
beast.	1
	1
Ermolov,	1
Miloradovich,	1
Platov,	1
and	1
others	1
in	1
proximity	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
near	1
Vyazma	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
their	1
desire	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
break	1
up	1
two	1
French	1
corps,	1
and	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
reporting	1
their	1
intention	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
they	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
blank	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
in	1
an	1
envelope.	1
	1
And	1
try	1
as	1
Kutuzov	1
might	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
troops,	1
our	1
men	1
attacked,	1
trying	1
to	1
bar	1
the	1
road.	1
Infantry	1
regiments,	1
we	1
are	1
told,	1
advanced	1
to	1
the	1
attack	1
with	1
music	1
and	1
with	1
drums	1
beating,	1
and	1
killed	1
and	1
lost	1
thousands	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
But	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
or	1
overthrow	1
anybody	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
closing	1
up	1
more	1
firmly	1
at	1
the	1
danger,	1
continued,	1
while	1
steadily	1
melting	1
away,	1
to	1
pursue	1
its	1
fatal	1
path	1
to	1
Smolensk.	1

	1
The	1
Battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
with	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
Moscow	1
that	1
followed	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
without	1
further	1
conflicts,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
instructive	1
phenomena	1
in	1
history.	1
	1
All	1
historians	1
agree	1
that	1
the	1
external	1
activity	1
of	1
states	1
and	1
nations	1
in	1
their	1
conflicts	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
is	1
expressed	1
in	1
wars,	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
direct	1
result	1
of	1
greater	1
or	1
less	1
success	1
in	1
war	1
the	1
political	1
strength	1
of	1
states	1
and	1
nations	1
increases	1
or	1
decreases.	1
	1
Strange	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
historical	1
account	1
of	1
how	1
some	1
king	1
or	1
emperor,	1
having	1
quarreled	1
with	1
another,	1
collects	1
an	1
army,	1
fights	1
his	1
enemy's	1
army,	1
gains	1
a	1
victory	1
by	1
killing	1
three,	1
five,	1
or	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
subjugates	1
a	1
kingdom	1
and	1
an	1
entire	1
nation	1
of	1
several	1
millions,	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
history	1
(as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
it)	1
confirm	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
statement	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
success	1
of	1
one	1
army	1
against	1
another	1
is	1
the	1
cause,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
essential	1
indication,	1
of	1
an	1
increase	1
or	1
decrease	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
nation--even	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
unintelligible	1
why	1
the	1
defeat	1
of	1
an	1
army--a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
nation--should	1
oblige	1
that	1
whole	1
nation	1
to	1
submit.	1
An	1
army	1
gains	1
a	1
victory,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
conquering	1
nation	1
have	1
increased	1
to	1
the	1
detriment	1
of	1
the	1
defeated.	1
An	1
army	1
has	1
suffered	1
defeat,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
people	1
loses	1
its	1
rights	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
severity	1
of	1
the	1
reverse,	1
and	1
if	1
its	1
army	1
suffers	1
a	1
complete	1
defeat	1
the	1
nation	1
is	1
quite	1
subjugated.	1
	1
So	1
according	1
to	1
history	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
ancient	1
times,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
day.	1
All	1
Napoleon's	1
wars	1
serve	1
to	1
confirm	1
this	1
rule.	1
In	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
defeat	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army	1
Austria	1
loses	1
its	1
rights,	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
France	1
increase.	1
The	1
victories	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
at	1
Jena	1
and	1
Auerstadt	1
destroy	1
the	1
independent	1
existence	1
of	1
Prussia.	1
	1
But	1
then,	1
in	1
1812,	1
the	1
French	1
gain	1
a	1
victory	1
near	1
Moscow.	1
Moscow	1
is	1
taken	1
and	1
after	1
that,	1
with	1
no	1
further	1
battles,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
Russia	1
that	1
ceases	1
to	1
exist,	1
but	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
of	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand,	1
and	1
then	1
Napoleonic	1
France	1
itself.	1
To	1
strain	1
the	1
facts	1
to	1
fit	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
history:	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
at	1
Borodino	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Russians,	1
or	1
that	1
after	1
Moscow	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
battles	1
that	1
destroyed	1
Napoleon's	1
army,	1
is	1
impossible.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
French	1
victory	1
at	1
Borodino	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
general	1
engagement	1
nor	1
any	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
all	1
serious,	1
yet	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
ceased	1
to	1
exist.	1
What	1
does	1
this	1
mean?	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
an	1
example	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
China,	1
we	1
might	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
historic	1
phenomenon	1
(which	1
is	1
the	1
historians'	1
usual	1
expedient	1
when	1
anything	1
does	1
not	1
fit	1
their	1
standards);	1
if	1
the	1
matter	1
concerned	1
some	1
brief	1
conflict	1
in	1
which	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
troops	1
took	1
part,	1
we	1
might	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
exception;	1
but	1
this	1
event	1
occurred	1
before	1
our	1
fathers'	1
eyes,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
of	1
their	1
fatherland,	1
and	1
it	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
known	1
wars.	1
	1
The	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812	1
from	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
to	1
the	1
expulsion	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
winning	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
does	1
not	1
produce	1
a	1
conquest	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
an	1
invariable	1
indication	1
of	1
conquest;	1
it	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
force	1
which	1
decides	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
peoples	1
lies	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
conquerors,	1
nor	1
even	1
in	1
armies	1
and	1
battles,	1
but	1
in	1
something	1
else.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
historians,	1
describing	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
before	1
it	1
left	1
Moscow,	1
affirm	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
in	1
order	1
in	1
the	1
Grand	1
Army,	1
except	1
the	1
cavalry,	1
the	1
artillery,	1
and	1
the	1
transport--there	1
was	1
no	1
forage	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
or	1
the	1
cattle.	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
misfortune	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
remedy,	1
for	1
the	1
peasants	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
burned	1
their	1
hay	1
rather	1
than	1
let	1
the	1
French	1
have	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
victory	1
gained	1
did	1
not	1
bring	1
the	1
usual	1
results	1
because	1
the	1
peasants	1
Karp	1
and	1
Vlas	1
(who	1
after	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
evacuated	1
Moscow	1
drove	1
in	1
their	1
carts	1
to	1
pillage	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
personally	1
failed	1
to	1
manifest	1
any	1
heroic	1
feelings),	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
innumerable	1
multitude	1
of	1
such	1
peasants,	1
did	1
not	1
bring	1
their	1
hay	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
the	1
high	1
price	1
offered	1
them,	1
but	1
burned	1
it	1
instead.	1
	1
Let	1
us	1
imagine	1
two	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
duel	1
with	1
rapiers	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
fencing.	1
The	1
fencing	1
has	1
gone	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
time;	1
suddenly	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
combatants,	1
feeling	1
himself	1
wounded	1
and	1
understanding	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
no	1
joke	1
but	1
concerns	1
his	1
life,	1
throws	1
down	1
his	1
rapier,	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
first	1
cudgel	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
hand	1
begins	1
to	1
brandish	1
it.	1
Then	1
let	1
us	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
combatant	1
who	1
so	1
sensibly	1
employed	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
simplest	1
means	1
to	1
attain	1
his	1
end	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
influenced	1
by	1
traditions	1
of	1
chivalry	1
and,	1
desiring	1
to	1
conceal	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
insisted	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
his	1
victory	1
with	1
the	1
rapier	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
art.	1
One	1
can	1
imagine	1
what	1
confusion	1
and	1
obscurity	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
such	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
duel.	1
	1
The	1
fencer	1
who	1
demanded	1
a	1
contest	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
fencing	1
was	1
the	1
French	1
army;	1
his	1
opponent	1
who	1
threw	1
away	1
the	1
rapier	1
and	1
snatched	1
up	1
the	1
cudgel	1
was	1
the	1
Russian	1
people;	1
those	1
who	1
try	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
matter	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
fencing	1
are	1
the	1
historians	1
who	1
have	1
described	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Smolensk	1
a	1
war	1
began	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
any	1
previous	1
traditions	1
of	1
war.	1
The	1
burning	1
of	1
towns	1
and	1
villages,	1
the	1
retreats	1
after	1
battles,	1
the	1
blow	1
dealt	1
at	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
renewed	1
retreat,	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
marauders,	1
the	1
seizure	1
of	1
transports,	1
and	1
the	1
guerrilla	1
war	1
were	1
all	1
departures	1
from	1
the	1
rules.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
felt	1
this,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
correct	1
fencing	1
attitude	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
opponent's	1
rapier	1
saw	1
a	1
cudgel	1
raised	1
above	1
his	1
head,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
complain	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules--as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
rules	1
for	1
killing	1
people.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
complaints	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
nonobservance	1
of	1
the	1
rules,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
to	1
some	1
highly	1
placed	1
Russians	1
it	1
seemed	1
rather	1
disgraceful	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
a	1
cudgel	1
and	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
assume	1
a	1
pose	1
en	1
quarte	1
or	1
en	1
tierce	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
adroit	1
thrust	1
en	1
prime,	1
and	1
so	1
on--the	1
cudgel	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
war	1
was	1
lifted	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
menacing	1
and	1
majestic	1
strength,	1
and	1
without	1
consulting	1
anyone's	1
tastes	1
or	1
rules	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
anything	1
else,	1
it	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
with	1
stupid	1
simplicity,	1
but	1
consistently,	1
and	1
belabored	1
the	1
French	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
invasion	1
had	1
perished.	1
	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
for	1
a	1
people	1
who	1
do	1
not--as	1
the	1
French	1
did	1
in	1
1813--	1
salute	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
art,	1
and,	1
presenting	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
their	1
rapier	1
gracefully	1
and	1
politely,	1
hand	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
magnanimous	1
conqueror,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
trial,	1
without	1
asking	1
what	1
rules	1
others	1
have	1
adopted	1
in	1
similar	1
cases,	1
simply	1
and	1
easily	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
first	1
cudgel	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
hand	1
and	1
strike	1
with	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
resentment	1
and	1
revenge	1
in	1
their	1
soul	1
yields	1
to	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
contempt	1
and	1
compassion.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
obvious	1
and	1
advantageous	1
departures	1
from	1
the	1
so-called	1
laws	1
of	1
war	1
is	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
scattered	1
groups	1
against	1
men	1
pressed	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
mass.	1
Such	1
action	1
always	1
occurs	1
in	1
wars	1
that	1
take	1
on	1
a	1
national	1
character.	1
In	1
such	1
actions,	1
instead	1
of	1
two	1
crowds	1
opposing	1
each	1
other,	1
the	1
men	1
disperse,	1
attack	1
singly,	1
run	1
away	1
when	1
attacked	1
by	1
stronger	1
forces,	1
but	1
again	1
attack	1
when	1
opportunity	1
offers.	1
This	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
guerrillas	1
in	1
Spain,	1
by	1
the	1
mountain	1
tribes	1
in	1
the	1
Caucasus,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Russians	1
in	1
1812.	1
	1
People	1
have	1
called	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
war	1
"guerrilla	1
warfare"	1
and	1
assume	1
that	1
by	1
so	1
calling	1
it	1
they	1
have	1
explained	1
its	1
meaning.	1
But	1
such	1
a	1
war	1
does	1
not	1
fit	1
in	1
under	1
any	1
rule	1
and	1
is	1
directly	1
opposed	1
to	1
a	1
well-known	1
rule	1
of	1
tactics	1
which	1
is	1
accepted	1
as	1
infallible.	1
That	1
rule	1
says	1
that	1
an	1
attacker	1
should	1
concentrate	1
his	1
forces	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
his	1
opponent	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
conflict.	1
	1
Guerrilla	1
war	1
(always	1
successful,	1
as	1
history	1
shows)	1
directly	1
infringes	1
that	1
rule.	1
	1
This	1
contradiction	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
military	1
science	1
assumes	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
be	1
identical	1
with	1
its	1
numbers.	1
Military	1
science	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
troops	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
strength.	1
Les	1
gros	1
bataillons	1
ont	1
toujours	1
raison.	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
Large	1
battalions	1
are	1
always	1
victorious.	1
	1
For	1
military	1
science	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
is	1
like	1
defining	1
momentum	1
in	1
mechanics	1
by	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
mass	1
only:	1
stating	1
that	1
momenta	1
are	1
equal	1
or	1
unequal	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
simply	1
because	1
the	1
masses	1
involved	1
are	1
equal	1
or	1
unequal.	1
	1
Momentum	1
(quantity	1
of	1
motion)	1
is	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
mass	1
and	1
velocity.	1
	1
In	1
military	1
affairs	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
is	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
its	1
mass	1
and	1
some	1
unknown	1
x.	1
	1
Military	1
science,	1
seeing	1
in	1
history	1
innumerable	1
instances	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
any	1
army	1
does	1
not	1
coincide	1
with	1
its	1
strength	1
and	1
that	1
small	1
detachments	1
defeat	1
larger	1
ones,	1
obscurely	1
admits	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
this	1
unknown	1
factor	1
and	1
tries	1
to	1
discover	1
it--now	1
in	1
a	1
geometric	1
formation,	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
equipment	1
employed,	1
now,	1
and	1
most	1
usually,	1
in	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
commanders.	1
But	1
the	1
assignment	1
of	1
these	1
various	1
meanings	1
to	1
the	1
factor	1
does	1
not	1
yield	1
results	1
which	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
historic	1
facts.	1
	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
false	1
view	1
(adopted	1
to	1
gratify	1
the	1
"heroes")	1
of	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
the	1
directions	1
issued	1
in	1
wartime	1
by	1
commanders,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
find	1
this	1
unknown	1
quantity.	1
	1
That	1
unknown	1
quantity	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
readiness	1
to	1
fight	1
and	1
face	1
danger	1
felt	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
composing	1
an	1
army,	1
quite	1
independently	1
of	1
whether	1
they	1
are,	1
or	1
are	1
not,	1
fighting	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
genius,	1
in	1
two--or	1
three-line	1
formation,	1
with	1
cudgels	1
or	1
with	1
rifles	1
that	1
repeat	1
thirty	1
times	1
a	1
minute.	1
Men	1
who	1
want	1
to	1
fight	1
will	1
always	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
advantageous	1
conditions	1
for	1
fighting.	1
	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
is	1
the	1
factor	1
which	1
multiplied	1
by	1
the	1
mass	1
gives	1
the	1
resulting	1
force.	1
To	1
define	1
and	1
express	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
unknown	1
factor--the	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
army--is	1
a	1
problem	1
for	1
science.	1
	1
This	1
problem	1
is	1
only	1
solvable	1
if	1
we	1
cease	1
arbitrarily	1
to	1
substitute	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
x	1
itself	1
the	1
conditions	1
under	1
which	1
that	1
force	1
becomes	1
apparent--such	1
as	1
the	1
commands	1
of	1
the	1
general,	1
the	1
equipment	1
employed,	1
and	1
so	1
on--mistaking	1
these	1
for	1
the	1
real	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
factor,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
recognize	1
this	1
unknown	1
quantity	1
in	1
its	1
entirety	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
desire	1
to	1
fight	1
and	1
to	1
face	1
danger.	1
Only	1
then,	1
expressing	1
known	1
historic	1
facts	1
by	1
equations	1
and	1
comparing	1
the	1
relative	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
factor,	1
can	1
we	1
hope	1
to	1
define	1
the	1
unknown.	1
	1
Ten	1
men,	1
battalions,	1
or	1
divisions,	1
fighting	1
fifteen	1
men,	1
battalions,	1
or	1
divisions,	1
conquer--that	1
is,	1
kill	1
or	1
take	1
captive--all	1
the	1
others,	1
while	1
themselves	1
losing	1
four,	1
so	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
four	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
fifteen	1
were	1
lost.	1
Consequently	1
the	1
four	1
were	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
fifteen,	1
and	1
therefore	1
4x	1
=	1
15y.	1
Consequently	1
x/y	1
=	1
15/4.	1
This	1
equation	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
unknown	1
factor	1
but	1
gives	1
us	1
a	1
ratio	1
between	1
two	1
unknowns.	1
And	1
by	1
bringing	1
variously	1
selected	1
historic	1
units	1
(battles,	1
campaigns,	1
periods	1
of	1
war)	1
into	1
such	1
equations,	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
numbers	1
could	1
be	1
obtained	1
in	1
which	1
certain	1
laws	1
should	1
exist	1
and	1
might	1
be	1
discovered.	1
	1
The	1
tactical	1
rule	1
that	1
an	1
army	1
should	1
act	1
in	1
masses	1
when	1
attacking,	1
and	1
in	1
smaller	1
groups	1
in	1
retreat,	1
unconsciously	1
confirms	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
depends	1
on	1
its	1
spirit.	1
To	1
lead	1
men	1
forward	1
under	1
fire	1
more	1
discipline	1
(obtainable	1
only	1
by	1
movement	1
in	1
masses)	1
is	1
needed	1
than	1
is	1
needed	1
to	1
resist	1
attacks.	1
But	1
this	1
rule	1
which	1
leaves	1
out	1
of	1
account	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
continually	1
proves	1
incorrect	1
and	1
is	1
in	1
particularly	1
striking	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
facts	1
when	1
some	1
strong	1
rise	1
or	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
occurs,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
national	1
wars.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
retreating	1
in	1
1812--though	1
according	1
to	1
tactics	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
separated	1
into	1
detachments	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves--congregated	1
into	1
a	1
mass	1
because	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
had	1
so	1
fallen	1
that	1
only	1
the	1
mass	1
held	1
the	1
army	1
together.	1
The	1
Russians,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
ought	1
according	1
to	1
tactics	1
to	1
have	1
attacked	1
in	1
mass,	1
but	1
in	1
fact	1
they	1
split	1
up	1
into	1
small	1
units,	1
because	1
their	1
spirit	1
had	1
so	1
risen	1
that	1
separate	1
individuals,	1
without	1
orders,	1
dealt	1
blows	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
without	1
needing	1
any	1
compulsion	1
to	1
induce	1
them	1
to	1
expose	1
themselves	1
to	1
hardships	1
and	1
dangers.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
The	1
so-called	1
partisan	1
war	1
began	1
with	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
into	1
Smolensk.	1
	1
Before	1
partisan	1
warfare	1
had	1
been	1
officially	1
recognized	1
by	1
the	1
government,	1
thousands	1
of	1
enemy	1
stragglers,	1
marauders,	1
and	1
foragers	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
the	1
peasants,	1
who	1
killed	1
them	1
off	1
as	1
instinctively	1
as	1
dogs	1
worry	1
a	1
stray	1
mad	1
dog	1
to	1
death.	1
Denis	1
Davydov,	1
with	1
his	1
Russian	1
instinct,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
recognize	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
this	1
terrible	1
cudgel	1
which	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
military	1
science	1
destroyed	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
belongs	1
the	1
credit	1
for	1
taking	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
toward	1
regularizing	1
this	1
method	1
of	1
warfare.	1
	1
On	1
August	1
24	1
Davydov's	1
first	1
partisan	1
detachment	1
was	1
formed	1
and	1
then	1
others	1
were	1
recognized.	1
The	1
further	1
the	1
campaign	1
progressed	1
the	1
more	1
numerous	1
these	1
detachments	1
became.	1
	1
The	1
irregulars	1
destroyed	1
the	1
great	1
army	1
piecemeal.	1
They	1
gathered	1
the	1
fallen	1
leaves	1
that	1
dropped	1
of	1
themselves	1
from	1
that	1
withered	1
tree--the	1
French	1
army--and	1
sometimes	1
shook	1
that	1
tree	1
itself.	1
By	1
October,	1
when	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
fleeing	1
toward	1
Smolensk,	1
there	1
were	1
hundreds	1
of	1
such	1
companies,	1
of	1
various	1
sizes	1
and	1
characters.	1
There	1
were	1
some	1
that	1
adopted	1
all	1
the	1
army	1
methods	1
and	1
had	1
infantry,	1
artillery,	1
staffs,	1
and	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life.	1
Others	1
consisted	1
solely	1
of	1
Cossack	1
cavalry.	1
There	1
were	1
also	1
small	1
scratch	1
groups	1
of	1
foot	1
and	1
horse,	1
and	1
groups	1
of	1
peasants	1
and	1
landowners	1
that	1
remained	1
unknown.	1
A	1
sacristan	1
commanded	1
one	1
party	1
which	1
captured	1
several	1
hundred	1
prisoners	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
month;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
Vasilisa,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
elder,	1
who	1
slew	1
hundreds	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
The	1
partisan	1
warfare	1
flamed	1
up	1
most	1
fiercely	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
of	1
October.	1
Its	1
first	1
period	1
had	1
passed:	1
when	1
the	1
partisans	1
themselves,	1
amazed	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
boldness,	1
feared	1
every	1
minute	1
to	1
be	1
surrounded	1
and	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
forests	1
without	1
unsaddling,	1
hardly	1
daring	1
to	1
dismount	1
and	1
always	1
expecting	1
to	1
be	1
pursued.	1
By	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
October	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
warfare	1
had	1
taken	1
definite	1
shape:	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
clear	1
to	1
all	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
ventured	1
against	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
what	1
could	1
not.	1
Now	1
only	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
detachments	1
with	1
staffs,	1
and	1
moving	1
according	1
to	1
rules	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
still	1
regarded	1
many	1
things	1
as	1
impossible.	1
The	1
small	1
bands	1
that	1
had	1
started	1
their	1
activities	1
long	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
already	1
observed	1
the	1
French	1
closely	1
considered	1
things	1
possible	1
which	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
detachments	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
contemplate.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
peasants	1
who	1
crept	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
French	1
now	1
considered	1
everything	1
possible.	1
	1
On	1
October	1
22,	1
Denisov	1
(who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
irregulars)	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
group	1
at	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
guerrilla	1
enthusiasm.	1
Since	1
early	1
morning	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
party	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
move.	1
All	1
day	1
long	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
from	1
the	1
forest	1
that	1
skirted	1
the	1
highroad	1
a	1
large	1
French	1
convoy	1
of	1
cavalry	1
baggage	1
and	1
Russian	1
prisoners	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
which--as	1
was	1
learned	1
from	1
spies	1
and	1
prisoners--was	1
moving	1
under	1
a	1
strong	1
escort	1
to	1
Smolensk.	1
Besides	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
(who	1
also	1
led	1
a	1
small	1
party	1
and	1
moved	1
in	1
Denisov's	1
vicinity),	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
some	1
large	1
divisions	1
with	1
staffs	1
also	1
knew	1
of	1
this	1
convoy	1
and,	1
as	1
Denisov	1
expressed	1
it,	1
were	1
sharpening	1
their	1
teeth	1
for	1
it.	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
large	1
parties--one	1
a	1
Pole	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
German--sent	1
invitations	1
to	1
Denisov	1
almost	1
simultaneously,	1
requesting	1
him	1
to	1
join	1
up	1
with	1
their	1
divisions	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
convoy.	1
	1
"No,	1
bwother,	1
I	1
have	1
gwown	1
mustaches	1
myself,"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
on	1
reading	1
these	1
documents,	1
and	1
he	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
German	1
that,	1
despite	1
his	1
heartfelt	1
desire	1
to	1
serve	1
under	1
so	1
valiant	1
and	1
renowned	1
a	1
general,	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
forgo	1
that	1
pleasure	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
Polish	1
general.	1
To	1
the	1
Polish	1
general	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
effect,	1
informing	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
German.	1
	1
Having	1
arranged	1
matters	1
thus,	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
intended,	1
without	1
reporting	1
matters	1
to	1
the	1
higher	1
command,	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
seize	1
that	1
convoy	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
small	1
forces.	1
On	1
October	1
22	1
it	1
was	1
moving	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Mikulino	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
Shamshevo.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
between	1
Mikulino	1
and	1
Shamshevo	1
there	1
were	1
large	1
forests,	1
extending	1
in	1
some	1
places	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
itself	1
though	1
in	1
others	1
a	1
mile	1
or	1
more	1
back	1
from	1
it.	1
Through	1
these	1
forests	1
Denisov	1
and	1
his	1
party	1
rode	1
all	1
day,	1
sometimes	1
keeping	1
well	1
back	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
sometimes	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
edge,	1
but	1
never	1
losing	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
French.	1
That	1
morning,	1
Cossacks	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
party	1
had	1
seized	1
and	1
carried	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
two	1
wagons	1
loaded	1
with	1
cavalry	1
saddles,	1
which	1
had	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Mikulino	1
where	1
the	1
forest	1
ran	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
road.	1
Since	1
then,	1
and	1
until	1
evening,	1
the	1
party	1
had	1
watched	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
without	1
attacking.	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
French	1
reach	1
Shamshevo	1
quietly	1
without	1
alarming	1
them	1
and	1
then,	1
after	1
joining	1
Dolokhov	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
a	1
consultation	1
at	1
a	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
Shamshevo,	1
to	1
surprise	1
the	1
French	1
at	1
dawn,	1
falling	1
like	1
an	1
avalanche	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
from	1
two	1
sides,	1
and	1
rout	1
and	1
capture	1
them	1
all	1
at	1
one	1
blow.	1
	1
In	1
their	1
rear,	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
Mikulino	1
where	1
the	1
forest	1
came	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
road,	1
six	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
posted	1
to	1
report	1
if	1
any	1
fresh	1
columns	1
of	1
French	1
should	1
show	1
themselves.	1
	1
Beyond	1
Shamshevo,	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
road	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
at	1
what	1
distance	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
French	1
troops.	1
They	1
reckoned	1
that	1
the	1
convoy	1
had	1
fifteen	1
hundred	1
men.	1
Denisov	1
had	1
two	1
hundred,	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
might	1
have	1
as	1
many	1
more,	1
but	1
the	1
disparity	1
of	1
numbers	1
did	1
not	1
deter	1
Denisov.	1
All	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
was	1
what	1
troops	1
these	1
were	1
and	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
"tongue"--that	1
is,	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
enemy	1
column.	1
That	1
morning's	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
wagons	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
so	1
hastily	1
that	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
with	1
the	1
wagons	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
killed;	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
drummer	1
boy	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
alive,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
straggler	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
them	1
nothing	1
definite	1
about	1
the	1
troops	1
in	1
that	1
column.	1
	1
Denisov	1
considered	1
it	1
dangerous	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
second	1
attack	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
putting	1
the	1
whole	1
column	1
on	1
the	1
alert,	1
so	1
he	1
sent	1
Tikhon	1
Shcherbaty,	1
a	1
peasant	1
of	1
his	1
party,	1
to	1
Shamshevo	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
seize	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
quartermasters	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
on	1
in	1
advance.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
warm	1
rainy	1
autumn	1
day.	1
The	1
sky	1
and	1
the	1
horizon	1
were	1
both	1
the	1
color	1
of	1
muddy	1
water.	1
At	1
times	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
mist	1
descended,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
heavy	1
slanting	1
rain	1
came	1
down.	1
	1
Denisov	1
in	1
a	1
felt	1
cloak	1
and	1
a	1
sheepskin	1
cap	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
rain	1
ran	1
down	1
was	1
riding	1
a	1
thin	1
thoroughbred	1
horse	1
with	1
sunken	1
sides.	1
Like	1
his	1
horse,	1
which	1
turned	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
laid	1
its	1
ears	1
back,	1
he	1
shrank	1
from	1
the	1
driving	1
rain	1
and	1
gazed	1
anxiously	1
before	1
him.	1
His	1
thin	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
short,	1
thick	1
black	1
beard	1
looked	1
angry.	1
	1
Beside	1
Denisov	1
rode	1
an	1
esaul,	1
*	1
Denisov's	1
fellow	1
worker,	1
also	1
in	1
felt	1
cloak	1
and	1
sheepskin	1
cap,	1
and	1
riding	1
a	1
large	1
sleek	1
Don	1
horse.	1
	1
	1
*	1
A	1
captain	1
of	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
Esaul	1
Lovayski	1
the	1
Third	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
as	1
straight	1
as	1
an	1
arrow,	1
pale-	1
faced,	1
fair-haired,	1
with	1
narrow	1
light	1
eyes	1
and	1
with	1
calm	1
self-	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
bearing.	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
rider	1
lay,	1
yet	1
at	1
first	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
esaul	1
and	1
Denisov	1
one	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
wet	1
and	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
horse,	1
while	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
esaul	1
one	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
comfortable	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
ease	1
as	1
always	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
mounted	1
a	1
horse,	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
horse,	1
a	1
being	1
consequently	1
possessed	1
of	1
twofold	1
strength.	1
	1
A	1
little	1
ahead	1
of	1
them	1
walked	1
a	1
peasant	1
guide,	1
wet	1
to	1
the	1
skin	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
gray	1
peasant	1
coat	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
knitted	1
cap.	1
	1
A	1
little	1
behind,	1
on	1
a	1
poor,	1
small,	1
lean	1
Kirghiz	1
mount	1
with	1
an	1
enormous	1
tail	1
and	1
mane	1
and	1
a	1
bleeding	1
mouth,	1
rode	1
a	1
young	1
officer	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
French	1
overcoat.	1
	1
Beside	1
him	1
rode	1
an	1
hussar,	1
with	1
a	1
boy	1
in	1
a	1
tattered	1
French	1
uniform	1
and	1
blue	1
cap	1
behind	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
crupper	1
of	1
his	1
horse.	1
The	1
boy	1
held	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
hussar	1
with	1
cold,	1
red	1
hands,	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
gazed	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
surprise.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
French	1
drummer	1
boy	1
captured	1
that	1
morning.	1
	1
Behind	1
them	1
along	1
the	1
narrow,	1
sodden,	1
cutup	1
forest	1
road	1
came	1
hussars	1
in	1
threes	1
and	1
fours,	1
and	1
then	1
Cossacks:	1
some	1
in	1
felt	1
cloaks,	1
some	1
in	1
French	1
greatcoats,	1
and	1
some	1
with	1
horsecloths	1
over	1
their	1
heads.	1
The	1
horses,	1
being	1
drenched	1
by	1
the	1
rain,	1
all	1
looked	1
black	1
whether	1
chestnut	1
or	1
bay.	1
Their	1
necks,	1
with	1
their	1
wet,	1
close-clinging	1
manes,	1
looked	1
strangely	1
thin.	1
Steam	1
rose	1
from	1
them.	1
Clothes,	1
saddles,	1
reins,	1
were	1
all	1
wet,	1
slippery,	1
and	1
sodden,	1
like	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
the	1
fallen	1
leaves	1
that	1
strewed	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
men	1
sat	1
huddled	1
up	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
stir,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
warm	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
had	1
trickled	1
to	1
their	1
bodies	1
and	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
fresh	1
cold	1
water	1
that	1
was	1
leaking	1
in	1
under	1
their	1
seats,	1
their	1
knees,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
their	1
necks.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
outspread	1
line	1
of	1
Cossacks	1
two	1
wagons,	1
drawn	1
by	1
French	1
horses	1
and	1
by	1
saddled	1
Cossack	1
horses	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
hitched	1
on	1
in	1
front,	1
rumbled	1
over	1
the	1
tree	1
stumps	1
and	1
branches	1
and	1
splashed	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
ruts.	1
	1
Denisov's	1
horse	1
swerved	1
aside	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
pool	1
in	1
the	1
track	1
and	1
bumped	1
his	1
rider's	1
knee	1
against	1
a	1
tree.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
devil!"	1
exclaimed	1
Denisov	1
angrily,	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
teeth	1
he	1
struck	1
his	1
horse	1
three	1
times	1
with	1
his	1
whip,	1
splashing	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
comrades	1
with	1
mud.	1
	1
Denisov	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sorts	1
both	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
rain	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
hunger	1
(none	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
eaten	1
anything	1
since	1
morning),	1
and	1
yet	1
more	1
because	1
he	1
still	1
had	1
no	1
news	1
from	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
sent	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
"tongue"	1
had	1
not	1
returned.	1
	1
"There'll	1
hardly	1
be	1
another	1
such	1
chance	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
a	1
transport	1
as	1
today.	1
It's	1
too	1
risky	1
to	1
attack	1
them	1
by	1
oneself,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
till	1
another	1
day	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
guerrilla	1
detachments	1
will	1
snatch	1
the	1
prey	1
from	1
under	1
our	1
noses,"	1
thought	1
Denisov,	1
continually	1
peering	1
forward,	1
hoping	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
messenger	1
from	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
On	1
coming	1
to	1
a	1
path	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
far	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
Denisov	1
stopped.	1
	1
"There's	1
someone	1
coming,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
esaul	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
Denisov	1
indicated.	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
two,	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
presupposable	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
colonel	1
himself,"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul,	1
who	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
using	1
words	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
	1
The	1
approaching	1
riders	1
having	1
descended	1
a	1
decline	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
visible,	1
but	1
they	1
reappeared	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later.	1
In	1
front,	1
at	1
a	1
weary	1
gallop	1
and	1
using	1
his	1
leather	1
whip,	1
rode	1
an	1
officer,	1
disheveled	1
and	1
drenched,	1
whose	1
trousers	1
had	1
worked	1
up	1
to	1
above	1
his	1
knees.	1
Behind	1
him,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
stirrups,	1
trotted	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
The	1
officer,	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
lad	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
rosy	1
face	1
and	1
keen	1
merry	1
eyes,	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
Denisov	1
and	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
sodden	1
envelope.	1
	1
"From	1
the	1
general,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer.	1
"Please	1
excuse	1
its	1
not	1
being	1
quite	1
dry."	1
	1
Denisov,	1
frowning,	1
took	1
the	1
envelope	1
and	1
opened	1
it.	1
	1
"There,	1
they	1
kept	1
telling	1
us:	1
'It's	1
dangerous,	1
it's	1
dangerous,'"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
addressing	1
the	1
esaul	1
while	1
Denisov	1
was	1
reading	1
the	1
dispatch.	1
"But	1
Komarov	1
and	1
I"--he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
Cossack--"were	1
prepared.	1
We	1
have	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
two	1
pistols....	1
But	1
what's	1
this?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
noticing	1
the	1
French	1
drummer	1
boy.	1
"A	1
prisoner?	1
You've	1
already	1
been	1
in	1
action?	1
May	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
"Wostov!	1
Petya!"	1
exclaimed	1
Denisov,	1
having	1
run	1
through	1
the	1
dispatch.	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
say	1
who	1
you	1
were?"	1
and	1
turning	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
lad.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
was	1
Petya	1
Rostov.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
way	1
Petya	1
had	1
been	1
preparing	1
himself	1
to	1
behave	1
with	1
Denisov	1
as	1
befitted	1
a	1
grownup	1
man	1
and	1
an	1
officer--without	1
hinting	1
at	1
their	1
previous	1
acquaintance.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Denisov	1
smiled	1
at	1
him	1
Petya	1
brightened	1
up,	1
blushed	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
forgot	1
the	1
official	1
manner	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
rehearsing,	1
and	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
battle	1
near	1
Vyazma	1
and	1
how	1
a	1
certain	1
hussar	1
had	1
distinguished	1
himself	1
there.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
Denisov	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
again	1
assumed	1
its	1
anxious	1
expression.	1
	1
"Michael	1
Feoklitych,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
esaul,	1
"this	1
is	1
again	1
fwom	1
that	1
German,	1
you	1
know.	1
He"--he	1
indicated	1
Petya--"is	1
serving	1
under	1
him."	1
	1
And	1
Denisov	1
told	1
the	1
esaul	1
that	1
the	1
dispatch	1
just	1
delivered	1
was	1
a	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
German	1
general's	1
demand	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
join	1
forces	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
transport.	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
don't	1
take	1
it	1
tomowwow,	1
he'll	1
snatch	1
it	1
fwom	1
under	1
our	1
noses,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
While	1
Denisov	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
esaul,	1
Petya--abashed	1
by	1
Denisov's	1
cold	1
tone	1
and	1
supposing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
his	1
trousers--	1
furtively	1
tried	1
to	1
pull	1
them	1
down	1
under	1
his	1
greatcoat	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
notice	1
it,	1
while	1
maintaining	1
as	1
martial	1
an	1
air	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
"Will	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
orders,	1
your	1
honor?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Denisov,	1
holding	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
the	1
salute	1
and	1
resuming	1
the	1
game	1
of	1
adjutant	1
and	1
general	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
himself,	1
"or	1
shall	1
I	1
remain	1
with	1
your	1
honor?"	1
	1
"Orders?"	1
Denisov	1
repeated	1
thoughtfully.	1
"But	1
can	1
you	1
stay	1
till	1
tomowwow?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
please...	1
May	1
I	1
stay	1
with	1
you?"	1
cried	1
Petya.	1
	1
"But,	1
just	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
genewal	1
tell	1
you?	1
To	1
weturn	1
at	1
once?"	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
Petya	1
blushed.	1
	1
"He	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
instructions.	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
could?"	1
he	1
returned,	1
inquiringly.	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
wight,"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
And	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
men	1
he	1
directed	1
a	1
party	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
halting	1
place	1
arranged	1
near	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
in	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
officer	1
on	1
the	1
Kirghiz	1
horse	1
(who	1
performed	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
an	1
adjutant)	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
that	1
evening.	1
Denisov	1
himself	1
intended	1
going	1
with	1
the	1
esaul	1
and	1
Petya	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
where	1
it	1
reached	1
out	1
to	1
Shamshevo,	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
bivouac	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
attack	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
"Well,	1
old	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
peasant	1
guide,	1
"lead	1
us	1
to	1
Shamshevo."	1
	1
Denisov,	1
Petya,	1
and	1
the	1
esaul,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
some	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
the	1
hussar	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
prisoner,	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
across	1
a	1
ravine	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
The	1
rain	1
had	1
stopped,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
mist	1
was	1
falling	1
and	1
drops	1
from	1
the	1
trees.	1
Denisov,	1
the	1
esaul,	1
and	1
Petya	1
rode	1
silently,	1
following	1
the	1
peasant	1
in	1
the	1
knitted	1
cap	1
who,	1
stepping	1
lightly	1
with	1
outturned	1
toes	1
and	1
moving	1
noiselessly	1
in	1
his	1
bast	1
shoes	1
over	1
the	1
roots	1
and	1
wet	1
leaves,	1
silently	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
He	1
ascended	1
an	1
incline,	1
stopped,	1
looked	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
advanced	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
screen	1
of	1
trees	1
was	1
less	1
dense.	1
On	1
reaching	1
a	1
large	1
oak	1
tree	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
shed	1
its	1
leaves,	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
beckoned	1
mysteriously	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Petya	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
From	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
peasant	1
was	1
standing	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
French.	1
Immediately	1
beyond	1
the	1
forest,	1
on	1
a	1
downward	1
slope,	1
lay	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
spring	1
rye.	1
To	1
the	1
right,	1
beyond	1
a	1
steep	1
ravine,	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
village	1
and	1
a	1
landowner's	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
roof.	1
In	1
the	1
village,	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
by	1
the	1
well,	1
by	1
the	1
pond,	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
rising	1
ground,	1
and	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
uphill	1
from	1
the	1
bridge	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
village,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
hundred	1
yards	1
away,	1
crowds	1
of	1
men	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
the	1
shimmering	1
mist.	1
Their	1
un-	1
Russian	1
shouting	1
at	1
their	1
horses	1
which	1
were	1
straining	1
uphill	1
with	1
the	1
carts,	1
and	1
their	1
calls	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
could	1
be	1
clearly	1
heard.	1
	1
"Bwing	1
the	1
prisoner	1
here,"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
A	1
Cossack	1
dismounted,	1
lifted	1
the	1
boy	1
down,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
Pointing	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
troops,	1
Denisov	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
these	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
them	1
were.	1
The	1
boy,	1
thrusting	1
his	1
cold	1
hands	1
into	1
his	1
pockets	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyebrows,	1
looked	1
at	1
Denisov	1
in	1
affright,	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
an	1
evident	1
desire	1
to	1
say	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
gave	1
confused	1
answers,	1
merely	1
assenting	1
to	1
everything	1
Denisov	1
asked	1
him.	1
Denisov	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
frowning	1
and	1
addressed	1
the	1
esaul,	1
conveying	1
his	1
own	1
conjectures	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Petya,	1
rapidly	1
turning	1
his	1
head,	1
looked	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy,	1
now	1
at	1
Denisov,	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
esaul,	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
road,	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
anything	1
of	1
importance.	1
	1
"Whether	1
Dolokhov	1
comes	1
or	1
not,	1
we	1
must	1
seize	1
it,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
with	1
a	1
merry	1
sparkle	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
suitable	1
spot,"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul.	1
	1
"We'll	1
send	1
the	1
infantwy	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
swamps,"	1
Denisov	1
continued.	1
"They'll	1
cweep	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
garden;	1
you'll	1
wide	1
up	1
fwom	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
Cossacks"--he	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
spot	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
beyond	1
the	1
village--"and	1
I	1
with	1
my	1
hussars	1
fwom	1
here.	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
signal	1
shot..."	1
	1
"The	1
hollow	1
is	1
impassable--there's	1
a	1
swamp	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul.	1
"The	1
horses	1
would	1
sink.	1
We	1
must	1
ride	1
round	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
left...."	1
	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
in	1
undertones	1
the	1
crack	1
of	1
a	1
shot	1
sounded	1
from	1
the	1
low	1
ground	1
by	1
the	1
pond,	1
a	1
puff	1
of	1
white	1
smoke	1
appeared,	1
then	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
hundreds	1
of	1
seemingly	1
merry	1
French	1
voices	1
shouting	1
together	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
slope.	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
Denisov	1
and	1
the	1
esaul	1
drew	1
back.	1
They	1
were	1
so	1
near	1
that	1
they	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
firing	1
and	1
shouting.	1
But	1
the	1
firing	1
and	1
shouting	1
did	1
not	1
relate	1
to	1
them.	1
Down	1
below,	1
a	1
man	1
wearing	1
something	1
red	1
was	1
running	1
through	1
the	1
marsh.	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
evidently	1
firing	1
and	1
shouting	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"Why,	1
that's	1
our	1
Tikhon,"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul.	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
is!	1
It	1
is!"	1
	1
"The	1
wascal!"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"He'll	1
get	1
away!"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
whom	1
they	1
called	1
Tikhon,	1
having	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
stream,	1
plunged	1
in	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
water	1
splashed	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and,	1
having	1
disappeared	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
scrambled	1
out	1
on	1
all	1
fours,	1
all	1
black	1
with	1
the	1
wet,	1
and	1
ran	1
on.	1
The	1
French	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
pursuing	1
him	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Smart,	1
that!"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
beast!"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
former	1
look	1
of	1
vexation.	1
"What	1
has	1
he	1
been	1
doing	1
all	1
this	1
time?"	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
he?"	1
asked	1
Petya.	1
	1
"He's	1
our	1
plastun.	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
'tongue.'"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,"	1
said	1
Petya,	1
nodding	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
Denisov	1
uttered	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
understood	1
it	1
all,	1
though	1
he	1
really	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
anything	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
Shcherbaty	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
indispensable	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
band.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
peasant	1
from	1
Pokrovsk,	1
near	1
the	1
river	1
Gzhat.	1
When	1
Denisov	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Pokrovsk	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
operations	1
and	1
had	1
as	1
usual	1
summoned	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
knew	1
about	1
the	1
French,	1
the	1
elder,	1
as	1
though	1
shielding	1
himself,	1
had	1
replied,	1
as	1
all	1
village	1
elders	1
did,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
neither	1
seen	1
nor	1
heard	1
anything	1
of	1
them.	1
But	1
when	1
Denisov	1
explained	1
that	1
his	1
purpose	1
was	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
no	1
French	1
had	1
strayed	1
that	1
way,	1
the	1
elder	1
replied	1
that	1
some	1
"more-orderers"	1
had	1
really	1
been	1
at	1
their	1
village,	1
but	1
that	1
Tikhon	1
Shcherbaty	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
dealt	1
with	1
such	1
matters.	1
Denisov	1
had	1
Tikhon	1
called	1
and,	1
having	1
praised	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
activity,	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
elder's	1
presence	1
about	1
loyalty	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
the	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
that	1
all	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
fatherland	1
should	1
cherish.	1
	1
"We	1
don't	1
do	1
the	1
French	1
any	1
harm,"	1
said	1
Tikhon,	1
evidently	1
frightened	1
by	1
Denisov's	1
words.	1
"We	1
only	1
fooled	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
lads	1
for	1
fun,	1
you	1
know!	1
We	1
killed	1
a	1
score	1
or	1
so	1
of	1
'more-orderers,'	1
but	1
we	1
did	1
no	1
harm	1
else..."	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
when	1
Denisov	1
had	1
left	1
Pokrovsk,	1
having	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
about	1
this	1
peasant,	1
it	1
was	1
reported	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Tikhon	1
had	1
attached	1
himself	1
to	1
their	1
party	1
and	1
asked	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
it.	1
Denisov	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
Tikhon,	1
who	1
at	1
first	1
did	1
rough	1
work,	1
laying	1
campfires,	1
fetching	1
water,	1
flaying	1
dead	1
horses,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
soon	1
showed	1
a	1
great	1
liking	1
and	1
aptitude	1
for	1
partisan	1
warfare.	1
At	1
night	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
out	1
for	1
booty	1
and	1
always	1
brought	1
back	1
French	1
clothing	1
and	1
weapons,	1
and	1
when	1
told	1
to	1
would	1
bring	1
in	1
French	1
captives	1
also.	1
Denisov	1
then	1
relieved	1
him	1
from	1
drudgery	1
and	1
began	1
taking	1
him	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
expeditions	1
and	1
had	1
him	1
enrolled	1
among	1
the	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
riding,	1
and	1
always	1
went	1
on	1
foot,	1
never	1
lagging	1
behind	1
the	1
cavalry.	1
He	1
was	1
armed	1
with	1
a	1
musketoon	1
(which	1
he	1
carried	1
rather	1
as	1
a	1
joke),	1
a	1
pike	1
and	1
an	1
ax,	1
which	1
latter	1
he	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
wolf	1
uses	1
its	1
teeth,	1
with	1
equal	1
ease	1
picking	1
fleas	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
fur	1
or	1
crunching	1
thick	1
bones.	1
Tikhon	1
with	1
equal	1
accuracy	1
would	1
split	1
logs	1
with	1
blows	1
at	1
arm's	1
length,	1
or	1
holding	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
ax	1
would	1
cut	1
thin	1
little	1
pegs	1
or	1
carve	1
spoons.	1
In	1
Denisov's	1
party	1
he	1
held	1
a	1
peculiar	1
and	1
exceptional	1
position.	1
When	1
anything	1
particularly	1
difficult	1
or	1
nasty	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done--	1
to	1
push	1
a	1
cart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mud	1
with	1
one's	1
shoulders,	1
pull	1
a	1
horse	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
swamp	1
by	1
its	1
tail,	1
skin	1
it,	1
slink	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
French,	1
or	1
walk	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
miles	1
in	1
a	1
day--everybody	1
pointed	1
laughingly	1
at	1
Tikhon.	1
	1
"It	1
won't	1
hurt	1
that	1
devil--he's	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
a	1
horse!"	1
they	1
said	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
Once	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
capture	1
fired	1
a	1
pistol	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
shot	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
fleshy	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
back.	1
That	1
wound	1
(which	1
Tikhon	1
treated	1
only	1
with	1
internal	1
and	1
external	1
applications	1
of	1
vodka)	1
was	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
liveliest	1
jokes	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
detachment--jokes	1
in	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
readily	1
joined.	1
	1
"Hallo,	1
mate!	1
Never	1
again?	1
Gave	1
you	1
a	1
twist?"	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
would	1
banter	1
him.	1
And	1
Tikhon,	1
purposely	1
writhing	1
and	1
making	1
faces,	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
and	1
swore	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
the	1
funniest	1
curses.	1
The	1
only	1
effect	1
of	1
this	1
incident	1
on	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
that	1
after	1
being	1
wounded	1
he	1
seldom	1
brought	1
in	1
prisoners.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
bravest	1
and	1
most	1
useful	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
party.	1
No	1
one	1
found	1
more	1
opportunities	1
for	1
attacking,	1
no	1
one	1
captured	1
or	1
killed	1
more	1
Frenchmen,	1
and	1
consequently	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
the	1
buffoon	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
hussars	1
and	1
willingly	1
accepted	1
that	1
role.	1
Now	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
by	1
Denisov	1
overnight	1
to	1
Shamshevo	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
"tongue."	1
But	1
whether	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
content	1
to	1
take	1
only	1
one	1
Frenchman	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
slept	1
through	1
the	1
night,	1
he	1
had	1
crept	1
by	1
day	1
into	1
some	1
bushes	1
right	1
among	1
the	1
French	1
and,	1
as	1
Denisov	1
had	1
witnessed	1
from	1
above,	1
had	1
been	1
detected	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
After	1
talking	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
esaul	1
about	1
next	1
day's	1
attack,	1
which	1
now,	1
seeing	1
how	1
near	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
French,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
definitely	1
decided	1
on,	1
Denisov	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
back.	1
	1
"Now,	1
my	1
lad,	1
we'll	1
go	1
and	1
get	1
dwy,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Petya.	1
	1
As	1
they	1
approached	1
the	1
watchhouse	1
Denisov	1
stopped,	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
forest.	1
Among	1
the	1
trees	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
long	1
legs	1
and	1
long,	1
swinging	1
arms,	1
wearing	1
a	1
short	1
jacket,	1
bast	1
shoes,	1
and	1
a	1
Kazan	1
hat,	1
was	1
approaching	1
with	1
long,	1
light	1
steps.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
musketoon	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
an	1
ax	1
stuck	1
in	1
his	1
girdle.	1
When	1
he	1
espied	1
Denisov	1
he	1
hastily	1
threw	1
something	1
into	1
the	1
bushes,	1
removed	1
his	1
sodden	1
hat	1
by	1
its	1
floppy	1
brim,	1
and	1
approached	1
his	1
commander.	1
It	1
was	1
Tikhon.	1
His	1
wrinkled	1
and	1
pockmarked	1
face	1
and	1
narrow	1
little	1
eyes	1
beamed	1
with	1
self-satisfied	1
merriment.	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
high	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
Denisov	1
as	1
if	1
repressing	1
a	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Well,	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
disappear	1
to?"	1
inquired	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Where	1
did	1
I	1
disappear	1
to?	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
get	1
Frenchmen,"	1
answered	1
Tikhon	1
boldly	1
and	1
hurriedly,	1
in	1
a	1
husky	1
but	1
melodious	1
bass	1
voice.	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
push	1
yourself	1
in	1
there	1
by	1
daylight?	1
You	1
ass!	1
Well,	1
why	1
haven't	1
you	1
taken	1
one?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
took	1
one	1
all	1
right,"	1
said	1
Tikhon.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
I	1
took	1
him	1
first	1
thing	1
at	1
dawn,"	1
Tikhon	1
continued,	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
flat	1
feet	1
with	1
outturned	1
toes	1
in	1
their	1
bast	1
shoes.	1
"I	1
took	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
forest.	1
Then	1
I	1
see	1
he's	1
no	1
good	1
and	1
think	1
I'll	1
go	1
and	1
fetch	1
a	1
likelier	1
one."	1
	1
"You	1
see?...	1
What	1
a	1
wogue--it's	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
thought,"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
to	1
the	1
esaul.	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
bwing	1
that	1
one?"	1
	1
"What	1
was	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
bringing	1
him?"	1
Tikhon	1
interrupted	1
hastily	1
and	1
angrily--"that	1
one	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
you.	1
As	1
if	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
sort	1
you	1
want!"	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
bwute	1
you	1
are!...	1
Well?"	1
	1
"I	1
went	1
for	1
another	1
one,"	1
Tikhon	1
continued,	1
"and	1
I	1
crept	1
like	1
this	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
lay	1
down."	1
(He	1
suddenly	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
stomach	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
movement	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
it.)	1
"One	1
turned	1
up	1
and	1
I	1
grabbed	1
him,	1
like	1
this."	1
(He	1
jumped	1
up	1
quickly	1
and	1
lightly.)	1
"'Come	1
along	1
to	1
the	1
colonel,'	1
I	1
said.	1
He	1
starts	1
yelling,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
were	1
four	1
of	1
them.	1
They	1
rushed	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
little	1
swords.	1
So	1
I	1
went	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
my	1
ax,	1
this	1
way:	1
'What	1
are	1
you	1
up	1
to?'	1
says	1
I.	1
'Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you!'"	1
shouted	1
Tikhon,	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
scowl	1
and	1
throwing	1
out	1
his	1
chest.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
saw	1
from	1
the	1
hill	1
how	1
you	1
took	1
to	1
your	1
heels	1
through	1
the	1
puddles!"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
Petya	1
badly	1
wanted	1
to	1
laugh,	1
but	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
refrained	1
from	1
laughing.	1
He	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
rapidly	1
from	1
Tikhon's	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
esaul's	1
and	1
Denisov's,	1
unable	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
all	1
meant.	1
	1
"Don't	1
play	1
the	1
fool!"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
coughing	1
angrily.	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
bwing	1
the	1
first	1
one?"	1
	1
Tikhon	1
scratched	1
his	1
back	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
then	1
suddenly	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
expanded	1
into	1
a	1
beaming,	1
foolish	1
grin,	1
disclosing	1
a	1
gap	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
tooth	1
(that	1
was	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
Shcherbaty--the	1
gap-toothed).	1
Denisov	1
smiled,	1
and	1
Petya	1
burst	1
into	1
a	1
peal	1
of	1
merry	1
laughter	1
in	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
himself	1
joined.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
regular	1
good-for-nothing,"	1
said	1
Tikhon.	1
"The	1
clothes	1
on	1
him--poor	1
stuff!	1
How	1
could	1
I	1
bring	1
him?	1
And	1
so	1
rude,	1
your	1
honor!	1
Why,	1
he	1
says:	1
'I'm	1
a	1
general's	1
son	1
myself,	1
I	1
won't	1
go!'	1
he	1
says."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
bwute!"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
"I	1
wanted	1
to	1
question..."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
questioned	1
him,"	1
said	1
Tikhon.	1
"He	1
said	1
he	1
didn't	1
know	1
much.	1
'There	1
are	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
us,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'but	1
all	1
poor	1
stuff--only	1
soldiers	1
in	1
name,'	1
he	1
says.	1
'Shout	1
loud	1
at	1
them,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'and	1
you'll	1
take	1
them	1
all,'"	1
Tikhon	1
concluded,	1
looking	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
resolutely	1
into	1
Denisov's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"I'll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
hundwed	1
sharp	1
lashes--that'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
fool!"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
severely.	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
angry?"	1
remonstrated	1
Tikhon,	1
"just	1
as	1
if	1
I'd	1
never	1
seen	1
your	1
Frenchmen!	1
Only	1
wait	1
till	1
it	1
gets	1
dark	1
and	1
I'll	1
fetch	1
you	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
you	1
want--three	1
if	1
you	1
like."	1
	1
"Well,	1
let's	1
go,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
rode	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
watchhouse	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
frowning	1
angrily.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
followed	1
behind	1
and	1
Petya	1
heard	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
laughing	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
him,	1
about	1
some	1
pair	1
of	1
boots	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
bushes.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter	1
that	1
had	1
seized	1
him	1
at	1
Tikhon's	1
words	1
and	1
smile	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
Petya	1
realized	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
this	1
Tikhon	1
had	1
killed	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
felt	1
uneasy.	1
He	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
captive	1
drummer	1
boy	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
pang	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
But	1
this	1
uneasiness	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
moment.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
head	1
higher,	1
to	1
brace	1
himself,	1
and	1
to	1
question	1
the	1
esaul	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
importance	1
about	1
tomorrow's	1
undertaking,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
unworthy	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
inquire	1
met	1
Denisov	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
soon	1
coming	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
Denisov	1
at	1
once	1
cheered	1
up	1
and,	1
calling	1
Petya	1
to	1
him,	1
said:	1
"Well,	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
yourself."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Petya,	1
having	1
left	1
his	1
people	1
after	1
their	1
departure	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
joined	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
taken	1
as	1
orderly	1
by	1
a	1
general	1
commanding	1
a	1
large	1
guerrilla	1
detachment.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
received	1
his	1
commission,	1
and	1
especially	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
joined	1
the	1
active	1
army	1
and	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Vyazma,	1
Petya	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
constant	1
state	1
of	1
blissful	1
excitement	1
at	1
being	1
grown-up	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
perpetual	1
ecstatic	1
hurry	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
any	1
chance	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
really	1
heroic.	1
He	1
was	1
highly	1
delighted	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
experienced	1
in	1
the	1
army,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
it	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
really	1
heroic	1
exploits	1
were	1
being	1
performed	1
just	1
where	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
happen	1
to	1
be.	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
get	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
not.	1
	1
When	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-first	1
of	1
October	1
his	1
general	1
expressed	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
send	1
somebody	1
to	1
Denisov's	1
detachment,	1
Petya	1
begged	1
so	1
piteously	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
that	1
the	1
general	1
could	1
not	1
refuse.	1
But	1
when	1
dispatching	1
him	1
he	1
recalled	1
Petya's	1
mad	1
action	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Vyazma,	1
where	1
instead	1
of	1
riding	1
by	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent,	1
he	1
had	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
advanced	1
line	1
under	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
had	1
there	1
twice	1
fired	1
his	1
pistol.	1
So	1
now	1
the	1
general	1
explicitly	1
forbade	1
his	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
any	1
action	1
whatever	1
of	1
Denisov's.	1
That	1
was	1
why	1
Petya	1
had	1
blushed	1
and	1
grown	1
confused	1
when	1
Denisov	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
stay.	1
Before	1
they	1
had	1
ridden	1
to	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
Petya	1
had	1
considered	1
he	1
must	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
instructions	1
strictly	1
and	1
return	1
at	1
once.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
saw	1
Tikhon	1
and	1
learned	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
an	1
attack	1
that	1
night,	1
he	1
decided,	1
with	1
the	1
rapidity	1
with	1
which	1
young	1
people	1
change	1
their	1
views,	1
that	1
the	1
general,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
greatly	1
respected	1
till	1
then,	1
was	1
a	1
rubbishy	1
German,	1
that	1
Denisov	1
was	1
a	1
hero,	1
the	1
esaul	1
a	1
hero,	1
and	1
Tikhon	1
a	1
hero	1
too,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
shameful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
difficulty.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
growing	1
dusk	1
when	1
Denisov,	1
Petya,	1
and	1
the	1
esaul	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
watchhouse.	1
In	1
the	1
twilight	1
saddled	1
horses	1
could	1
be	1
seen,	1
and	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
hussars	1
who	1
had	1
rigged	1
up	1
rough	1
shelters	1
in	1
the	1
glade	1
and	1
were	1
kindling	1
glowing	1
fires	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
where	1
the	1
French	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
smoke.	1
In	1
the	1
passage	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
watchhouse	1
a	1
Cossack	1
with	1
sleeves	1
rolled	1
up	1
was	1
chopping	1
some	1
mutton.	1
In	1
the	1
room	1
three	1
officers	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
band	1
were	1
converting	1
a	1
door	1
into	1
a	1
tabletop.	1
Petya	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
wet	1
clothes,	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
dried,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
helping	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
fix	1
up	1
the	1
dinner	1
table.	1
	1
In	1
ten	1
minutes	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
ready	1
and	1
a	1
napkin	1
spread	1
on	1
it.	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
were	1
vodka,	1
a	1
flask	1
of	1
rum,	1
white	1
bread,	1
roast	1
mutton,	1
and	1
salt.	1
	1
Sitting	1
at	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
tearing	1
the	1
fat	1
savory	1
mutton	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
down	1
which	1
the	1
grease	1
trickled,	1
Petya	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
ecstatic	1
childish	1
state	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
consequently	1
of	1
confidence	1
that	1
others	1
loved	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
	1
"So	1
then	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
"It's	1
all	1
right	1
my	1
staying	1
a	1
day	1
with	1
you?"	1
And	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
answered	1
his	1
own	1
question:	1
"You	1
see	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
find	1
out--well,	1
I	1
am	1
finding	1
out....	1
Only	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
very...	1
into	1
the	1
chief...	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
a	1
reward...	1
But	1
I	1
want..."	1
	1
Petya	1
clenched	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
looked	1
around,	1
throwing	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arms.	1
	1
"Into	1
the	1
vewy	1
chief..."	1
Denisov	1
repeated	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Only,	1
please	1
let	1
me	1
command	1
something,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
really	1
command..."	1
Petya	1
went	1
on.	1
"What	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
you?...	1
Oh,	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
knife?"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
cut	1
himself	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
mutton.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
handed	1
him	1
his	1
clasp	1
knife.	1
The	1
officer	1
admired	1
it.	1
	1
"Please	1
keep	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
several	1
like	1
it,"	1
said	1
Petya,	1
blushing.	1
"Heavens!	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
forgetting!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
cried.	1
"I	1
have	1
some	1
raisins,	1
fine	1
ones;	1
you	1
know,	1
seedless	1
ones.	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
new	1
sutler	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
such	1
capital	1
things.	1
I	1
bought	1
ten	1
pounds.	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
something	1
sweet.	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
some?..."	1
and	1
Petya	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
to	1
his	1
Cossack	1
and	1
brought	1
back	1
some	1
bags	1
which	1
contained	1
about	1
five	1
pounds	1
of	1
raisins.	1
"Have	1
some,	1
gentlemen,	1
have	1
some!"	1
	1
"You	1
want	1
a	1
coffeepot,	1
don't	1
you?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
esaul.	1
"I	1
bought	1
a	1
capital	1
one	1
from	1
our	1
sutler!	1
He	1
has	1
splendid	1
things.	1
And	1
he's	1
very	1
honest,	1
that's	1
the	1
chief	1
thing.	1
I'll	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
send	1
it	1
to	1
you.	1
Or	1
perhaps	1
your	1
flints	1
are	1
giving	1
out,	1
or	1
are	1
worn	1
out--that	1
happens	1
sometimes,	1
you	1
know.	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
some	1
with	1
me,	1
here	1
they	1
are"--and	1
he	1
showed	1
a	1
bag--"a	1
hundred	1
flints.	1
I	1
bought	1
them	1
very	1
cheap.	1
Please	1
take	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
you	1
want,	1
or	1
all	1
if	1
you	1
like...."	1
	1
Then	1
suddenly,	1
dismayed	1
lest	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
too	1
much,	1
Petya	1
stopped	1
and	1
blushed.	1
	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
remember	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
anything	1
else	1
that	1
was	1
foolish.	1
And	1
running	1
over	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
French	1
drummer	1
boy.	1
"It's	1
capital	1
for	1
us	1
here,	1
but	1
what	1
of	1
him?	1
Where	1
have	1
they	1
put	1
him?	1
Have	1
they	1
fed	1
him?	1
Haven't	1
they	1
hurt	1
his	1
feelings?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
But	1
having	1
caught	1
himself	1
saying	1
too	1
much	1
about	1
the	1
flints,	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
out.	1
	1
"I	1
might	1
ask,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"but	1
they'll	1
say:	1
'He's	1
a	1
boy	1
himself	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
pities	1
the	1
boy.'	1
I'll	1
show	1
them	1
tomorrow	1
whether	1
I'm	1
a	1
boy.	1
Will	1
it	1
seem	1
odd	1
if	1
I	1
ask?"	1
Petya	1
thought.	1
"Well,	1
never	1
mind!"	1
and	1
immediately,	1
blushing	1
and	1
looking	1
anxiously	1
at	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
they	1
appeared	1
ironical,	1
he	1
said:	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
call	1
in	1
that	1
boy	1
who	1
was	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat?...	1
Perhaps..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he's	1
a	1
poor	1
little	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
evidently	1
saw	1
nothing	1
shameful	1
in	1
this	1
reminder.	1
"Call	1
him	1
in.	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
Vincent	1
Bosse.	1
Have	1
him	1
fetched."	1
	1
"I'll	1
call	1
him,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
call	1
him.	1
A	1
poor	1
little	1
fellow,"	1
Denisov	1
repeated.	1
	1
Petya	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
when	1
Denisov	1
said	1
this.	1
He	1
slipped	1
in	1
between	1
the	1
officers,	1
came	1
close	1
to	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
kiss	1
you,	1
dear	1
old	1
fellow!	1
Oh,	1
how	1
fine,	1
how	1
splendid!"	1
	1
And	1
having	1
kissed	1
Denisov	1
he	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hut.	1
	1
"Bosse!	1
Vincent!"	1
Petya	1
cried,	1
stopping	1
outside	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Who	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
sir?"	1
asked	1
a	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
Petya	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
the	1
French	1
lad	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Vesenny?"	1
said	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
	1
Vincent,	1
the	1
boy's	1
name,	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
changed	1
by	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
into	1
Vesenny	1
(vernal)	1
and	1
into	1
Vesenya	1
by	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
soldiers.	1
In	1
both	1
these	1
adaptations	1
the	1
reference	1
to	1
spring	1
(vesna)	1
matched	1
the	1
impression	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
lad.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
warming	1
himself	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
bonfire.	1
Ho,	1
Vesenya!	1
Vesenya!--	1
Vesenny!"	1
laughing	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
calling	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
smart	1
lad,"	1
said	1
an	1
hussar	1
standing	1
near	1
Petya.	1
"We	1
gave	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
a	1
while	1
ago.	1
He	1
was	1
awfully	1
hungry!"	1
	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
bare	1
feet	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
c'est	1
vous!"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
"Voulez-vous	1
manger?	1
N'ayez	1
pas	1
peur,	1
on	1
ne	1
vous	1
fera	1
pas	1
de	1
mal,"	1
*	1
he	1
added	1
shyly	1
and	1
affectionately,	1
touching	1
the	1
boy's	1
hand.	1
"Entrez,	1
entrez."	1
*(2)	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Ah,	1
it's	1
you!	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
something	1
to	1
eat?	1
Don't	1
be	1
afraid,	1
they	1
won't	1
hurt	1
you."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"Come	1
in,	1
come	1
in."	1
	1
"Merci,	1
monsieur,"	1
*	1
said	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
almost	1
childish	1
voice,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
scraping	1
his	1
dirty	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
threshold.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
sir."	1
	1
There	1
were	1
many	1
things	1
Petya	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to.	1
He	1
stood	1
irresolutely	1
beside	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
Then	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
boy's	1
hand	1
and	1
pressed	1
it.	1
	1
"Come	1
in,	1
come	1
in!"	1
he	1
repeated	1
in	1
a	1
gentle	1
whisper.	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
him?"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
boy	1
pass	1
in	1
first.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
boy	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
hut,	1
Petya	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
him,	1
considering	1
it	1
beneath	1
his	1
dignity	1
to	1
pay	1
attention	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
he	1
fingered	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
wondered	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
ridiculous	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
to	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
arrival	1
of	1
Dolokhov	1
diverted	1
Petya's	1
attention	1
from	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy,	1
to	1
whom	1
Denisov	1
had	1
had	1
some	1
mutton	1
and	1
vodka	1
given,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
Russian	1
coat	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
kept	1
with	1
their	1
band	1
and	1
not	1
sent	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
prisoners.	1
Petya	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
many	1
stories	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
extraordinary	1
bravery	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
cruelty	1
to	1
the	1
French,	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
hut	1
Petya	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
him,	1
but	1
braced	1
himself	1
up	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
held	1
his	1
head	1
high,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
unworthy	1
even	1
of	1
such	1
company.	1
	1
Dolokhov's	1
appearance	1
amazed	1
Petya	1
by	1
its	1
simplicity.	1
	1
Denisov	1
wore	1
a	1
Cossack	1
coat,	1
had	1
a	1
beard,	1
had	1
an	1
icon	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
Wonder-Worker	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
speaking	1
and	1
everything	1
he	1
did	1
indicated	1
his	1
unusual	1
position.	1
But	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
in	1
Moscow	1
had	1
worn	1
a	1
Persian	1
costume,	1
had	1
now	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
correct	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards.	1
He	1
was	1
clean-shaven	1
and	1
wore	1
a	1
Guardsman's	1
padded	1
coat	1
with	1
an	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
at	1
his	1
buttonhole	1
and	1
a	1
plain	1
forage	1
cap	1
set	1
straight	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
wet	1
felt	1
cloak	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
without	1
greeting	1
anyone	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Denisov	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
hand.	1
Denisov	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
designs	1
the	1
large	1
detachments	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
transport,	1
of	1
the	1
message	1
Petya	1
had	1
brought,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
replies	1
to	1
both	1
generals.	1
Then	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
detachment.	1
	1
"That's	1
so.	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
know	1
what	1
troops	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
their	1
numbers,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
"It	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
there.	1
We	1
can't	1
start	1
the	1
affair	1
without	1
knowing	1
for	1
certain	1
how	1
many	1
there	1
are.	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
work	1
accurately.	1
Here	1
now--wouldn't	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
like	1
to	1
ride	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
camp	1
with	1
me?	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
a	1
spare	1
uniform."	1
	1
"I,	1
I...	1
I'll	1
go	1
with	1
you!"	1
cried	1
Petya.	1
	1
"There's	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
addressing	1
Dolokhov,	1
"and	1
as	1
for	1
him,	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
on	1
any	1
account."	1
	1
"I	1
like	1
that!"	1
exclaimed	1
Petya.	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
I	1
go?"	1
	1
"Because	1
it's	1
useless."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me,	1
because...	1
because...	1
I	1
shall	1
go,	1
and	1
that's	1
all.	1
You'll	1
take	1
me,	1
won't	1
you?"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
Dolokhov	1
answered	1
absently,	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
drummer	1
boy.	1
"Have	1
you	1
had	1
that	1
youngster	1
with	1
you	1
long?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
taken	1
today	1
but	1
he	1
knows	1
nothing.	1
I'm	1
keeping	1
him	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
put	1
the	1
others?"	1
inquired	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Where?	1
I	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
weceipt	1
for	1
them,"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
suddenly	1
flushing.	1
"And	1
I	1
say	1
boldly	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
man's	1
life	1
on	1
my	1
conscience.	1
Would	1
it	1
be	1
difficult	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
send	1
thirty	1
or	1
thwee	1
hundwed	1
men	1
to	1
town	1
under	1
escort,	1
instead	1
of	1
staining--I	1
speak	1
bluntly--	1
staining	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
a	1
soldier?"	1
	1
"That	1
kind	1
of	1
amiable	1
talk	1
would	1
be	1
suitable	1
from	1
this	1
young	1
count	1
of	1
sixteen,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
cold	1
irony,	1
"but	1
it's	1
time	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
drop	1
it."	1
	1
"Why,	1
I've	1
not	1
said	1
anything!	1
I	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
I'll	1
certainly	1
go	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
Petya	1
shyly.	1
	1
"But	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
me,	1
old	1
fellow,	1
it's	1
time	1
to	1
drop	1
these	1
amenities,"	1
continued	1
Dolokhov,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
particular	1
pleasure	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
this	1
subject	1
which	1
irritated	1
Denisov.	1
"Now,	1
why	1
have	1
you	1
kept	1
this	1
lad?"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
swaying	1
his	1
head.	1
"Because	1
you	1
are	1
sorry	1
for	1
him!	1
Don't	1
we	1
know	1
those	1
'receipts'	1
of	1
yours?	1
You	1
send	1
a	1
hundred	1
men	1
away,	1
and	1
thirty	1
get	1
there.	1
The	1
rest	1
either	1
starve	1
or	1
get	1
killed.	1
So	1
isn't	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
not	1
to	1
send	1
them?"	1
	1
The	1
esaul,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
light-colored	1
eyes,	1
nodded	1
approvingly.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
I'm	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
conscience.	1
You	1
say	1
they'll	1
die.	1
All	1
wight.	1
Only	1
not	1
by	1
my	1
fault!"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
began	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Who	1
has	1
told	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
capture	1
me	1
these	1
twenty	1
times	1
over?	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
catch	1
me	1
they'd	1
string	1
me	1
up	1
to	1
an	1
aspen	1
tree,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
chivalry	1
just	1
the	1
same."	1
He	1
paused.	1
"However,	1
we	1
must	1
get	1
to	1
work.	1
Tell	1
the	1
Cossack	1
to	1
fetch	1
my	1
kit.	1
I	1
have	1
two	1
French	1
uniforms	1
in	1
it.	1
Well,	1
are	1
you	1
coming	1
with	1
me?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Petya.	1
	1
"I?	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
certainly!"	1
cried	1
Petya,	1
blushing	1
almost	1
to	1
tears	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
Denisov.	1
	1
While	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
been	1
disputing	1
with	1
Denisov	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
prisoners,	1
Petya	1
had	1
once	1
more	1
felt	1
awkward	1
and	1
restless;	1
but	1
again	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
grasp	1
fully	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about.	1
"If	1
grown-up,	1
distinguished	1
men	1
think	1
so,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
necessary	1
and	1
right,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"But	1
above	1
all	1
Denisov	1
must	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
I'll	1
obey	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
order	1
me	1
about.	1
I	1
will	1
certainly	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
camp	1
with	1
Dolokhov.	1
If	1
he	1
can,	1
so	1
can	1
I!"	1
	1
And	1
to	1
all	1
Denisov's	1
persuasions,	1
Petya	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
accurately	1
and	1
not	1
just	1
anyhow,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
considered	1
personal	1
danger.	1
	1
"For	1
you'll	1
admit	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
don't	1
know	1
for	1
sure	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
there	1
are...	1
hundreds	1
of	1
lives	1
may	1
depend	1
on	1
it,	1
while	1
there	1
are	1
only	1
two	1
of	1
us.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
very	1
much	1
and	1
certainly	1
will	1
go,	1
so	1
don't	1
hinder	1
me,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
will	1
only	1
make	1
things	1
worse..."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Having	1
put	1
on	1
French	1
greatcoats	1
and	1
shakos,	1
Petya	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
clearing	1
from	1
which	1
Denisov	1
had	1
reconnoitered	1
the	1
French	1
camp,	1
and	1
emerging	1
from	1
the	1
forest	1
in	1
pitch	1
darkness	1
they	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
hollow.	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
bottom,	1
Dolokhov	1
told	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
accompanying	1
him	1
to	1
await	1
him	1
there	1
and	1
rode	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
quick	1
trot	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Petya,	1
his	1
heart	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
with	1
excitement,	1
rode	1
by	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
"If	1
we're	1
caught,	1
I	1
won't	1
be	1
taken	1
alive!	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
pistol,"	1
whispered	1
he.	1
	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
Russian,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
in	1
a	1
hurried	1
whisper,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
they	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
the	1
challenge:	1
"Qui	1
vive?"	1
*	1
and	1
the	1
click	1
of	1
a	1
musket.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Who	1
goes	1
there?"	1
	1
The	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
Petya's	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
grasped	1
his	1
pistol.	1
	1
"Lanciers	1
du	1
6-me,"	1
*	1
replied	1
Dolokhov,	1
neither	1
hastening	1
nor	1
slackening	1
his	1
horse's	1
pace.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Lancers	1
of	1
the	1
6th	1
Regiment."	1
	1
The	1
black	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
sentinel	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
"Mot	1
d'ordre."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Password."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
advanced	1
at	1
a	1
walk.	1
	1
"Dites	1
donc,	1
le	1
colonel	1
Gerard	1
est	1
ici?"	1
*	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
is	1
Colonel	1
Gerard	1
here?"	1
	1
"Mot	1
d'ordre,"	1
repeated	1
the	1
sentinel,	1
barring	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
not	1
replying.	1
	1
"Quand	1
un	1
officier	1
fait	1
sa	1
ronde,	1
les	1
sentinelles	1
ne	1
demandent	1
pas	1
le	1
mot	1
d'ordre..."	1
cried	1
Dolokhov	1
suddenly	1
flaring	1
up	1
and	1
riding	1
straight	1
at	1
the	1
sentinel.	1
"Je	1
vous	1
demande	1
si	1
le	1
colonel	1
est	1
ici."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"When	1
an	1
officer	1
is	1
making	1
his	1
round,	1
sentinels	1
don't	1
ask	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
password....	1
I	1
am	1
asking	1
you	1
if	1
the	1
colonel	1
is	1
here."	1
	1
And	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
the	1
sentinel,	1
who	1
had	1
stepped	1
aside,	1
Dolokhov	1
rode	1
up	1
the	1
incline	1
at	1
a	1
walk.	1
	1
Noticing	1
the	1
black	1
outline	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
crossing	1
the	1
road,	1
Dolokhov	1
stopped	1
him	1
and	1
inquired	1
where	1
the	1
commander	1
and	1
officers	1
were.	1
The	1
man,	1
a	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
sack	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
stopped,	1
came	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
Dolokhov's	1
horse,	1
touched	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
explained	1
simply	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
were	1
higher	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
farm,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
landowner's	1
house.	1
	1
Having	1
ridden	1
up	1
the	1
road,	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
which	1
French	1
talk	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
around	1
the	1
campfires,	1
Dolokhov	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
landowner's	1
house.	1
Having	1
ridden	1
in,	1
he	1
dismounted	1
and	1
approached	1
a	1
big	1
blazing	1
campfire,	1
around	1
which	1
sat	1
several	1
men	1
talking	1
noisily.	1
Something	1
was	1
boiling	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
cauldron	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
a	1
soldier	1
in	1
a	1
peaked	1
cap	1
and	1
blue	1
overcoat,	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
was	1
kneeling	1
beside	1
it	1
stirring	1
its	1
contents	1
with	1
a	1
ramrod.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he's	1
a	1
hard	1
nut	1
to	1
crack,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"He'll	1
make	1
them	1
get	1
a	1
move	1
on,	1
those	1
fellows!"	1
said	1
another,	1
laughing.	1
	1
Both	1
fell	1
silent,	1
peering	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
and	1
Petya's	1
steps	1
as	1
they	1
advanced	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
leading	1
their	1
horses.	1
	1
"Bonjour,	1
messieurs!"	1
*	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
loudly	1
and	1
clearly.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Good	1
day,	1
gentlemen."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
among	1
the	1
officers	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
beyond	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
one	1
tall,	1
long-necked	1
officer,	1
walking	1
round	1
the	1
fire,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Is	1
that	1
you,	1
Clement?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Where	1
the	1
devil...?"	1
But,	1
noticing	1
his	1
mistake,	1
he	1
broke	1
off	1
short	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
frown,	1
greeted	1
Dolokhov	1
as	1
a	1
stranger,	1
asking	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
overtake	1
their	1
regiment,	1
and	1
addressing	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
general	1
asked	1
whether	1
they	1
knew	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
6th	1
Regiment.	1
None	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
anything,	1
and	1
Petya	1
thought	1
the	1
officers	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
hostility	1
and	1
suspicion.	1
For	1
some	1
seconds	1
all	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
were	1
counting	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
soup,	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
too	1
late,"	1
said	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
a	1
repressed	1
laugh.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
replied	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
hungry	1
and	1
must	1
push	1
on	1
farther	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
He	1
handed	1
the	1
horses	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
stirring	1
the	1
pot	1
and	1
squatted	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
heels	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
beside	1
the	1
officer	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
neck.	1
That	1
officer	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
again	1
asked	1
to	1
what	1
regiment	1
he	1
belonged.	1
Dolokhov,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
the	1
question,	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
but	1
lighting	1
a	1
short	1
French	1
pipe	1
which	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
began	1
asking	1
the	1
officer	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
the	1
road	1
before	1
them	1
was	1
safe	1
from	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
"Those	1
brigands	1
are	1
everywhere,"	1
replied	1
an	1
officer	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
remarked	1
that	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
a	1
danger	1
only	1
to	1
stragglers	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
companion	1
and	1
himself,	1
"but	1
probably	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
attack	1
large	1
detachments?"	1
he	1
added	1
inquiringly.	1
No	1
one	1
replied.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
he'll	1
come	1
away,"	1
Petya	1
thought	1
every	1
moment	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
campfire	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
talk.	1
	1
But	1
Dolokhov	1
restarted	1
the	1
conversation	1
which	1
had	1
dropped	1
and	1
began	1
putting	1
direct	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
many	1
men	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
battalion,	1
how	1
many	1
battalions,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
prisoners.	1
Asking	1
about	1
the	1
Russian	1
prisoners	1
with	1
that	1
detachment,	1
Dolokhov	1
said:	1
	1
"A	1
horrid	1
business	1
dragging	1
these	1
corpses	1
about	1
with	1
one!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
shoot	1
such	1
rabble,"	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
loud	1
laughter,	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
Petya	1
thought	1
the	1
French	1
would	1
immediately	1
detect	1
their	1
disguise,	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
campfire.	1
	1
No	1
one	1
replied	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Dolokhov's	1
laughter,	1
and	1
a	1
French	1
officer	1
whom	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
(he	1
lay	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
greatcoat)	1
rose	1
and	1
whispered	1
something	1
to	1
a	1
companion.	1
Dolokhov	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
their	1
horses.	1
	1
"Will	1
they	1
bring	1
our	1
horses	1
or	1
not?"	1
thought	1
Petya,	1
instinctively	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
brought.	1
	1
"Good	1
evening,	1
gentlemen,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
Petya	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
"Good	1
night"	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
a	1
word.	1
The	1
officers	1
were	1
whispering	1
together.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
mounting	1
his	1
horse	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
stand	1
still,	1
then	1
he	1
rode	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
at	1
a	1
footpace.	1
Petya	1
rode	1
beside	1
him,	1
longing	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
running	1
after	1
them,	1
but	1
not	1
daring	1
to.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
road	1
Dolokhov	1
did	1
not	1
ride	1
back	1
across	1
the	1
open	1
country,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
village.	1
At	1
one	1
spot	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
listened.	1
"Do	1
you	1
hear?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
Petya	1
recognized	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Russian	1
voices	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
dark	1
figures	1
of	1
Russian	1
prisoners	1
round	1
their	1
campfires.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
descended	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
Petya	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
rode	1
past	1
the	1
sentinel,	1
who	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
paced	1
morosely	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
it,	1
then	1
they	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
hollow	1
where	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
awaited	1
them.	1
	1
"Well	1
now,	1
good-by.	1
Tell	1
Denisov,	1
'at	1
the	1
first	1
shot	1
at	1
daybreak,'"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ride	1
away,	1
but	1
Petya	1
seized	1
hold	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Really!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"you	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
hero!	1
Oh,	1
how	1
fine,	1
how	1
splendid!	1
How	1
I	1
love	1
you!"	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
But	1
Petya	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
saw	1
through	1
the	1
gloom	1
that	1
Petya	1
was	1
bending	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
kiss	1
him.	1
Dolokhov	1
kissed	1
him,	1
laughed,	1
turned	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Having	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut,	1
Petya	1
found	1
Denisov	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
He	1
was	1
awaiting	1
Petya's	1
return	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
agitation,	1
anxiety,	1
and	1
self-reproach	1
for	1
having	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
he	1
exclaimed.	1
"Yes,	1
thank	1
God!"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
listening	1
to	1
Petya's	1
rapturous	1
account.	1
"But,	1
devil	1
take	1
you,	1
I	1
haven't	1
slept	1
because	1
of	1
you!	1
Well,	1
thank	1
God.	1
Now	1
lie	1
down.	1
We	1
can	1
still	1
get	1
a	1
nap	1
before	1
morning."	1
	1
"But...	1
no,"	1
said	1
Petya,	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
sleep	1
yet.	1
Besides	1
I	1
know	1
myself,	1
if	1
I	1
fall	1
asleep	1
it's	1
finished.	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
not	1
sleeping	1
before	1
a	1
battle."	1
	1
He	1
sat	1
awhile	1
in	1
the	1
hut	1
joyfully	1
recalling	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
expedition	1
and	1
vividly	1
picturing	1
to	1
himself	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
Then,	1
noticing	1
that	1
Denisov	1
was	1
asleep,	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
doors.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
still	1
quite	1
dark	1
outside.	1
The	1
rain	1
was	1
over,	1
but	1
drops	1
were	1
still	1
falling	1
from	1
the	1
trees.	1
Near	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
the	1
black	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
Cossacks'	1
shanties	1
and	1
of	1
horses	1
tethered	1
together	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
Behind	1
the	1
hut	1
the	1
dark	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
wagons	1
with	1
their	1
horses	1
beside	1
them	1
were	1
discernible,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
the	1
dying	1
campfire	1
gleamed	1
red.	1
Not	1
all	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
hussars	1
were	1
asleep;	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
amid	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
falling	1
drops	1
and	1
the	1
munching	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
near	1
by,	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
low	1
voices	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
whispering.	1
	1
Petya	1
came	1
out,	1
peered	1
into	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
wagons.	1
Someone	1
was	1
snoring	1
under	1
them,	1
and	1
around	1
them	1
stood	1
saddled	1
horses	1
munching	1
their	1
oats.	1
In	1
the	1
dark	1
Petya	1
recognized	1
his	1
own	1
horse,	1
which	1
he	1
called	1
"Karabakh"	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
Ukranian	1
breed,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Karabakh!	1
We'll	1
do	1
some	1
service	1
tomorrow,"	1
said	1
he,	1
sniffing	1
its	1
nostrils	1
and	1
kissing	1
it.	1
	1
"Why	1
aren't	1
you	1
asleep,	1
sir?"	1
said	1
a	1
Cossack	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
under	1
a	1
wagon.	1
	1
"No,	1
ah...	1
Likhachev--isn't	1
that	1
your	1
name?	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
back!	1
We've	1
been	1
into	1
the	1
French	1
camp."	1
	1
And	1
Petya	1
gave	1
the	1
Cossack	1
a	1
detailed	1
account	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
ride	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
his	1
object,	1
and	1
why	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
better	1
to	1
risk	1
his	1
life	1
than	1
to	1
act	1
"just	1
anyhow."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
should	1
get	1
some	1
sleep	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
this,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
"I	1
say,	1
aren't	1
the	1
flints	1
in	1
your	1
pistols	1
worn	1
out?	1
I	1
brought	1
some	1
with	1
me.	1
Don't	1
you	1
want	1
any?	1
You	1
can	1
have	1
some."	1
	1
The	1
Cossack	1
bent	1
forward	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
wagon	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
closer	1
look	1
at	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Because	1
I	1
am	1
accustomed	1
to	1
doing	1
everything	1
accurately,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
"Some	1
fellows	1
do	1
things	1
just	1
anyhow,	1
without	1
preparation,	1
and	1
then	1
they're	1
sorry	1
for	1
it	1
afterwards.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
"Just	1
so,"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
another	1
thing!	1
Please,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
will	1
you	1
sharpen	1
my	1
saber	1
for	1
me?	1
It's	1
got	1
bl..."	1
(Petya	1
feared	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
the	1
saber	1
never	1
had	1
been	1
sharpened.)	1
"Can	1
you	1
do	1
it?"	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
I	1
can."	1
	1
Likhachev	1
got	1
up,	1
rummaged	1
in	1
his	1
pack,	1
and	1
soon	1
Petya	1
heard	1
the	1
warlike	1
sound	1
of	1
steel	1
on	1
whetstone.	1
He	1
climbed	1
onto	1
the	1
wagon	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
its	1
edge.	1
The	1
Cossack	1
was	1
sharpening	1
the	1
saber	1
under	1
the	1
wagon.	1
	1
"I	1
say!	1
Are	1
the	1
lads	1
asleep?"	1
asked	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Some	1
are,	1
and	1
some	1
aren't--like	1
us."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
that	1
boy?"	1
	1
"Vesenny?	1
Oh,	1
he's	1
thrown	1
himself	1
down	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
Fast	1
asleep	1
after	1
his	1
fright.	1
He	1
was	1
that	1
glad!"	1
	1
After	1
that	1
Petya	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sounds.	1
He	1
heard	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
figure	1
appeared.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
sharpening?"	1
asked	1
a	1
man	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
wagon.	1
	1
"Why,	1
this	1
gentleman's	1
saber."	1
	1
"That's	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
whom	1
Petya	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
hussar.	1
"Was	1
the	1
cup	1
left	1
here?"	1
	1
"There,	1
by	1
the	1
wheel!"	1
	1
The	1
hussar	1
took	1
the	1
cup.	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
daylight	1
soon,"	1
said	1
he,	1
yawning,	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
	1
Petya	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
forest	1
with	1
Denisov's	1
guerrilla	1
band,	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
wagon	1
captured	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
beside	1
which	1
horses	1
were	1
tethered,	1
that	1
under	1
it	1
Likhachev	1
was	1
sitting	1
sharpening	1
a	1
saber	1
for	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
big	1
dark	1
blotch	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
was	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut,	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
blotch	1
below	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
was	1
the	1
dying	1
embers	1
of	1
a	1
campfire,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
the	1
cup	1
was	1
an	1
hussar	1
who	1
wanted	1
a	1
drink;	1
but	1
he	1
neither	1
knew	1
nor	1
waited	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
all	1
this.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
fairy	1
kingdom	1
where	1
nothing	1
resembled	1
reality.	1
The	1
big	1
dark	1
blotch	1
might	1
really	1
be	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
or	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
cavern	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
red	1
spot	1
was	1
a	1
fire,	1
or	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
an	1
enormous	1
monster.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
wagon,	1
but	1
it	1
might	1
very	1
well	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
wagon	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
terribly	1
high	1
tower	1
from	1
which,	1
if	1
he	1
fell,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
fall	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
or	1
a	1
whole	1
month,	1
or	1
go	1
on	1
falling	1
and	1
never	1
reach	1
the	1
bottom.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
Cossack,	1
Likhachev,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
under	1
the	1
wagon,	1
but	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
kindest,	1
bravest,	1
most	1
wonderful,	1
most	1
splendid	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
whom	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
of.	1
It	1
might	1
really	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
the	1
hussar	1
came	1
for	1
water	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
hollow,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
simply	1
vanished--disappeared	1
altogether	1
and	1
dissolved	1
into	1
nothingness.	1
	1
Nothing	1
Petya	1
could	1
have	1
seen	1
now	1
would	1
have	1
surprised	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
fairy	1
kingdom	1
where	1
everything	1
was	1
possible.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky.	1
And	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
a	1
fairy	1
realm	1
like	1
the	1
earth.	1
It	1
was	1
clearing,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
clouds	1
were	1
swiftly	1
sailing	1
as	1
if	1
unveiling	1
the	1
stars.	1
Sometimes	1
it	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
clouds	1
were	1
passing,	1
and	1
a	1
clear	1
black	1
sky	1
appeared.	1
Sometimes	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
black	1
spaces	1
were	1
clouds.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
sky	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
rising	1
high,	1
high	1
overhead,	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
sink	1
so	1
low	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
touch	1
it	1
with	1
one's	1
hand.	1
	1
Petya's	1
eyes	1
began	1
to	1
close	1
and	1
he	1
swayed	1
a	1
little.	1
	1
The	1
trees	1
were	1
dripping.	1
Quiet	1
talking	1
was	1
heard.	1
The	1
horses	1
neighed	1
and	1
jostled	1
one	1
another.	1
Someone	1
snored.	1
	1
"Ozheg-zheg,	1
Ozheg-zheg..."	1
hissed	1
the	1
saber	1
against	1
the	1
whetstone,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
Petya	1
heard	1
an	1
harmonious	1
orchestra	1
playing	1
some	1
unknown,	1
sweetly	1
solemn	1
hymn.	1
Petya	1
was	1
as	1
musical	1
as	1
Natasha	1
and	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
Nicholas,	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
learned	1
music	1
or	1
thought	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
melody	1
that	1
unexpectedly	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
particularly	1
fresh	1
and	1
attractive.	1
The	1
music	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
audible.	1
The	1
melody	1
grew	1
and	1
passed	1
from	1
one	1
instrument	1
to	1
another.	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
played	1
was	1
a	1
fugue--though	1
Petya	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
conception	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
fugue	1
is.	1
Each	1
instrument--now	1
resembling	1
a	1
violin	1
and	1
now	1
a	1
horn,	1
but	1
better	1
and	1
clearer	1
than	1
violin	1
or	1
horn--played	1
its	1
own	1
part,	1
and	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
melody	1
merged	1
with	1
another	1
instrument	1
that	1
began	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
air,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
third	1
and	1
a	1
fourth;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
blended	1
into	1
one	1
and	1
again	1
became	1
separate	1
and	1
again	1
blended,	1
now	1
into	1
solemn	1
church	1
music,	1
now	1
into	1
something	1
dazzlingly	1
brilliant	1
and	1
triumphant.	1
	1
"Oh--why,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
dream!"	1
Petya	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
he	1
lurched	1
forward.	1
"It's	1
in	1
my	1
ears.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
it's	1
music	1
of	1
my	1
own.	1
Well,	1
go	1
on,	1
my	1
music!	1
Now!..."	1
	1
He	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and,	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
distance,	1
sounds	1
fluttered,	1
grew	1
into	1
harmonies,	1
separated,	1
blended,	1
and	1
again	1
all	1
mingled	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
sweet	1
and	1
solemn	1
hymn.	1
"Oh,	1
this	1
is	1
delightful!	1
As	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
like	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
like!"	1
said	1
Petya	1
to	1
himself.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
conduct	1
that	1
enormous	1
orchestra.	1
	1
"Now	1
softly,	1
softly	1
die	1
away!"	1
and	1
the	1
sounds	1
obeyed	1
him.	1
"Now	1
fuller,	1
more	1
joyful.	1
Still	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
joyful!"	1
And	1
from	1
an	1
unknown	1
depth	1
rose	1
increasingly	1
triumphant	1
sounds.	1
"Now	1
voices	1
join	1
in!"	1
ordered	1
Petya.	1
And	1
at	1
first	1
from	1
afar	1
he	1
heard	1
men's	1
voices	1
and	1
then	1
women's.	1
The	1
voices	1
grew	1
in	1
harmonious	1
triumphant	1
strength,	1
and	1
Petya	1
listened	1
to	1
their	1
surpassing	1
beauty	1
in	1
awe	1
and	1
joy.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
solemn	1
triumphal	1
march	1
there	1
mingled	1
a	1
song,	1
the	1
drip	1
from	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
the	1
hissing	1
of	1
the	1
saber,	1
"Ozheg-zheg-zheg..."	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
horses	1
jostled	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
neighed,	1
not	1
disturbing	1
the	1
choir	1
but	1
joining	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
Petya	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
long	1
this	1
lasted:	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
himself	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
wondered	1
at	1
his	1
enjoyment	1
and	1
regretted	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
share	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
Likhachev's	1
kindly	1
voice.	1
	1
"It's	1
ready,	1
your	1
honor;	1
you	1
can	1
split	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
in	1
half	1
with	1
it!"	1
	1
Petya	1
woke	1
up.	1
	1
"It's	1
getting	1
light,	1
it's	1
really	1
getting	1
light!"	1
he	1
exclaimed.	1
	1
The	1
horses	1
that	1
had	1
previously	1
been	1
invisible	1
could	1
now	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
their	1
very	1
tails,	1
and	1
a	1
watery	1
light	1
showed	1
itself	1
through	1
the	1
bare	1
branches.	1
Petya	1
shook	1
himself,	1
jumped	1
up,	1
took	1
a	1
ruble	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Likhachev;	1
then	1
he	1
flourished	1
the	1
saber,	1
tested	1
it,	1
and	1
sheathed	1
it.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
untying	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
tightening	1
their	1
saddle	1
girths.	1
	1
"And	1
here's	1
the	1
commander,"	1
said	1
Likhachev.	1
	1
Denisov	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
and,	1
having	1
called	1
Petya,	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
get	1
ready.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
The	1
men	1
rapidly	1
picked	1
out	1
their	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
semidarkness,	1
tightened	1
their	1
saddle	1
girths,	1
and	1
formed	1
companies.	1
Denisov	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
giving	1
final	1
orders.	1
The	1
infantry	1
of	1
the	1
detachment	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
quickly	1
disappeared	1
amid	1
the	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
early	1
dawn,	1
hundreds	1
of	1
feet	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud.	1
The	1
esaul	1
gave	1
some	1
orders	1
to	1
his	1
men.	1
Petya	1
held	1
his	1
horse	1
by	1
the	1
bridle,	1
impatiently	1
awaiting	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
mount.	1
His	1
face,	1
having	1
been	1
bathed	1
in	1
cold	1
water,	1
was	1
all	1
aglow,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
particularly	1
brilliant.	1
Cold	1
shivers	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
spine	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
pulsed	1
rhythmically.	1
	1
"Well,	1
is	1
ev'wything	1
weady?"	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
"Bwing	1
the	1
horses."	1
	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
brought.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
Cossack	1
because	1
the	1
saddle	1
girths	1
were	1
too	1
slack,	1
reproved	1
him,	1
and	1
mounted.	1
Petya	1
put	1
his	1
foot	1
in	1
the	1
stirrup.	1
His	1
horse	1
by	1
habit	1
made	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
nip	1
his	1
leg,	1
but	1
Petya	1
leaped	1
quickly	1
into	1
the	1
saddle	1
unconscious	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
weight	1
and,	1
turning	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
hussars	1
starting	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
behind	1
him,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Vasili	1
Dmitrich,	1
entrust	1
me	1
with	1
some	1
commission!	1
Please...	1
for	1
God's	1
sake...!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Denisov	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
Petya's	1
very	1
existence.	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
ask	1
one	1
thing	1
of	1
you,"	1
he	1
said	1
sternly,	1
"to	1
obey	1
me	1
and	1
not	1
shove	1
yourself	1
forward	1
anywhere."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
another	1
word	1
to	1
Petya	1
but	1
rode	1
in	1
silence	1
all	1
the	1
way.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
it	1
was	1
noticeably	1
growing	1
light	1
over	1
the	1
field.	1
Denisov	1
talked	1
in	1
whispers	1
with	1
the	1
esaul	1
and	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
rode	1
past	1
Petya	1
and	1
Denisov.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
ridden	1
by,	1
Denisov	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
down	1
the	1
hill.	1
Slipping	1
onto	1
their	1
haunches	1
and	1
sliding,	1
the	1
horses	1
descended	1
with	1
their	1
riders	1
into	1
the	1
ravine.	1
Petya	1
rode	1
beside	1
Denisov,	1
the	1
pulsation	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
constantly	1
increasing.	1
It	1
was	1
getting	1
lighter	1
and	1
lighter,	1
but	1
the	1
mist	1
still	1
hid	1
distant	1
objects.	1
Having	1
reached	1
the	1
valley,	1
Denisov	1
looked	1
back	1
and	1
nodded	1
to	1
a	1
Cossack	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
signal!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
Cossack	1
raised	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
a	1
shot	1
rang	1
out.	1
In	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses	1
galloping	1
forward	1
was	1
heard,	1
shouts	1
came	1
from	1
various	1
sides,	1
and	1
then	1
more	1
shots.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
first	1
sound	1
of	1
trampling	1
hoofs	1
and	1
shouting,	1
Petya	1
lashed	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
loosening	1
his	1
rein	1
galloped	1
forward,	1
not	1
heeding	1
Denisov	1
who	1
shouted	1
at	1
him.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Petya	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
shot	1
was	1
fired	1
it	1
suddenly	1
became	1
as	1
bright	1
as	1
noon.	1
He	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
galloping	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
bridge	1
he	1
collided	1
with	1
a	1
Cossack	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
behind,	1
but	1
he	1
galloped	1
on.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
soldiers,	1
probably	1
Frenchmen,	1
were	1
running	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left	1
across	1
the	1
road.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
under	1
his	1
horse's	1
feet.	1
	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
crowding	1
about	1
a	1
hut,	1
busy	1
with	1
something.	1
From	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
that	1
crowd	1
terrible	1
screams	1
arose.	1
Petya	1
galloped	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
the	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
trembling	1
jaw	1
of	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
clutching	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
a	1
lance	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
aimed	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"Hurrah!...	1
Lads!...	1
ours!"	1
shouted	1
Petya,	1
and	1
giving	1
rein	1
to	1
his	1
excited	1
horse	1
he	1
galloped	1
forward	1
along	1
the	1
village	1
street.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
hear	1
shooting	1
ahead	1
of	1
him.	1
Cossacks,	1
hussars,	1
and	1
ragged	1
Russian	1
prisoners,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
running	1
from	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
were	1
shouting	1
something	1
loudly	1
and	1
incoherently.	1
A	1
gallant-looking	1
Frenchman,	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
overcoat,	1
capless,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
frowning	1
red	1
face,	1
had	1
been	1
defending	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
hussars.	1
When	1
Petya	1
galloped	1
up	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
already	1
fallen.	1
"Too	1
late	1
again!"	1
flashed	1
through	1
Petya's	1
mind	1
and	1
he	1
galloped	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
rapid	1
firing	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
The	1
shots	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
yard	1
of	1
the	1
landowner's	1
house	1
he	1
had	1
visited	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
with	1
Dolokhov.	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
making	1
a	1
stand	1
there	1
behind	1
a	1
wattle	1
fence	1
in	1
a	1
garden	1
thickly	1
overgrown	1
with	1
bushes	1
and	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
who	1
crowded	1
at	1
the	1
gateway.	1
Through	1
the	1
smoke,	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
gate,	1
Petya	1
saw	1
Dolokhov,	1
whose	1
face	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
pale-greenish	1
tint,	1
shouting	1
to	1
his	1
men.	1
"Go	1
round!	1
Wait	1
for	1
the	1
infantry!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
as	1
Petya	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Wait?...	1
Hurrah-ah-ah!"	1
shouted	1
Petya,	1
and	1
without	1
pausing	1
a	1
moment	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
whence	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
smoke	1
was	1
thickest.	1
	1
A	1
volley	1
was	1
heard,	1
and	1
some	1
bullets	1
whistled	1
past,	1
while	1
others	1
plashed	1
against	1
something.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
galloped	1
after	1
Petya	1
into	1
the	1
gateway	1
of	1
the	1
courtyard.	1
In	1
the	1
dense	1
wavering	1
smoke	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bushes	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Cossacks,	1
while	1
others	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
toward	1
the	1
pond.	1
Petya	1
was	1
galloping	1
along	1
the	1
courtyard,	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
holding	1
the	1
reins	1
he	1
waved	1
both	1
his	1
arms	1
about	1
rapidly	1
and	1
strangely,	1
slipping	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
in	1
his	1
saddle.	1
His	1
horse,	1
having	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
campfire	1
that	1
was	1
smoldering	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
light,	1
stopped	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
Petya	1
fell	1
heavily	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
wet	1
ground.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
jerked	1
rapidly	1
though	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
quite	1
motionless.	1
A	1
bullet	1
had	1
pierced	1
his	1
skull.	1
	1
After	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
senior	1
French	1
officer,	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
handkerchief	1
tied	1
to	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
announced	1
that	1
they	1
surrendered,	1
Dolokhov	1
dismounted	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Petya,	1
who	1
lay	1
motionless	1
with	1
outstretched	1
arms.	1
	1
"Done	1
for!"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
frown,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
to	1
meet	1
Denisov	1
who	1
was	1
riding	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
"Killed?"	1
cried	1
Denisov,	1
recognizing	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
the	1
unmistakably	1
lifeless	1
attitude--very	1
familiar	1
to	1
him--in	1
which	1
Petya's	1
body	1
was	1
lying.	1
	1
"Done	1
for!"	1
repeated	1
Dolokhov	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
utterance	1
of	1
these	1
words	1
afforded	1
him	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
quickly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
who	1
were	1
surrounded	1
by	1
Cossacks	1
who	1
had	1
hurried	1
up.	1
"We	1
won't	1
take	1
them!"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
	1
Denisov	1
did	1
not	1
reply;	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Petya,	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands	1
turned	1
toward	1
himself	1
the	1
bloodstained,	1
mud-bespattered	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
white.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
something	1
sweet.	1
Raisins,	1
fine	1
ones...	1
take	1
them	1
all!"	1
he	1
recalled	1
Petya's	1
words.	1
And	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
sound,	1
like	1
the	1
yelp	1
of	1
a	1
dog,	1
with	1
which	1
Denisov	1
turned	1
away,	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
wattle	1
fence,	1
and	1
seized	1
hold	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
Russian	1
prisoners	1
rescued	1
by	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
Pierre	1
Bezukhov.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
their	1
march	1
from	1
Moscow	1
no	1
fresh	1
orders	1
had	1
been	1
issued	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
authorities	1
concerning	1
the	1
party	1
of	1
prisoners	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
Pierre.	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-second	1
of	1
October	1
that	1
party	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
troops	1
and	1
baggage	1
trains	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow.	1
Half	1
the	1
wagons	1
laden	1
with	1
hardtack	1
that	1
had	1
traveled	1
the	1
first	1
stages	1
with	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
by	1
Cossacks,	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
ahead.	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
dismounted	1
cavalrymen	1
who	1
had	1
marched	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
was	1
left;	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
disappeared.	1
The	1
artillery	1
the	1
prisoners	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
was	1
now	1
replaced	1
by	1
Marshal	1
Junot's	1
enormous	1
baggage	1
train,	1
convoyed	1
by	1
Westphalians.	1
Behind	1
the	1
prisoners	1
came	1
a	1
cavalry	1
baggage	1
train.	1
	1
From	1
Vyazma	1
onwards	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
which	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
moved	1
in	1
three	1
columns,	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
group.	1
The	1
symptoms	1
of	1
disorder	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
noticed	1
at	1
their	1
first	1
halting	1
place	1
after	1
leaving	1
Moscow	1
had	1
now	1
reached	1
the	1
utmost	1
limit.	1
	1
The	1
road	1
along	1
which	1
they	1
moved	1
was	1
bordered	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
by	1
dead	1
horses;	1
ragged	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
behind	1
from	1
various	1
regiments	1
continually	1
changed	1
about,	1
now	1
joining	1
the	1
moving	1
column,	1
now	1
again	1
lagging	1
behind	1
it.	1
	1
Several	1
times	1
during	1
the	1
march	1
false	1
alarms	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
escort	1
had	1
raised	1
their	1
muskets,	1
fired,	1
and	1
run	1
headlong,	1
crushing	1
one	1
another,	1
but	1
had	1
afterwards	1
reassembled	1
and	1
abused	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
their	1
causeless	1
panic.	1
	1
These	1
three	1
groups	1
traveling	1
together--the	1
cavalry	1
stores,	1
the	1
convoy	1
of	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
Junot's	1
baggage	1
train--still	1
constituted	1
a	1
separate	1
and	1
united	1
whole,	1
though	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
groups	1
was	1
rapidly	1
melting	1
away.	1
	1
Of	1
the	1
artillery	1
baggage	1
train	1
which	1
had	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
wagons,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
sixty	1
now	1
remained;	1
the	1
rest	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
or	1
left	1
behind.	1
Some	1
of	1
Junot's	1
wagons	1
also	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
or	1
abandoned.	1
Three	1
wagons	1
had	1
been	1
raided	1
and	1
robbed	1
by	1
stragglers	1
from	1
Davout's	1
corps.	1
From	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
Germans	1
Pierre	1
learned	1
that	1
a	1
larger	1
guard	1
had	1
been	1
allotted	1
to	1
that	1
baggage	1
train	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
comrades,	1
a	1
German	1
soldier,	1
had	1
been	1
shot	1
by	1
the	1
marshal's	1
own	1
order	1
because	1
a	1
silver	1
spoon	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
marshal	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
The	1
group	1
of	1
prisoners	1
had	1
melted	1
away	1
most	1
of	1
all.	1
Of	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
Moscow	1
fewer	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
now	1
remained.	1
The	1
prisoners	1
were	1
more	1
burdensome	1
to	1
the	1
escort	1
than	1
even	1
the	1
cavalry	1
saddles	1
or	1
Junot's	1
baggage.	1
They	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
saddles	1
and	1
Junot's	1
spoon	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
use,	1
but	1
that	1
cold	1
and	1
hungry	1
soldiers	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
stand	1
and	1
guard	1
equally	1
cold	1
and	1
hungry	1
Russians	1
who	1
froze	1
and	1
lagged	1
behind	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
(in	1
which	1
case	1
the	1
order	1
was	1
to	1
shoot	1
them)	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
incomprehensible	1
but	1
revolting.	1
And	1
the	1
escort,	1
as	1
if	1
afraid,	1
in	1
the	1
grievous	1
condition	1
they	1
themselves	1
were	1
in,	1
of	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
pity	1
they	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
so	1
rendering	1
their	1
own	1
plight	1
still	1
worse,	1
treated	1
them	1
with	1
particular	1
moroseness	1
and	1
severity.	1
	1
At	1
Dorogobuzh	1
while	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
convoy,	1
after	1
locking	1
the	1
prisoners	1
in	1
a	1
stable,	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
to	1
pillage	1
their	1
own	1
stores,	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
soldier	1
prisoners	1
tunneled	1
under	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
ran	1
away,	1
but	1
were	1
recaptured	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
shot.	1
	1
The	1
arrangement	1
adopted	1
when	1
they	1
started,	1
that	1
the	1
officer	1
prisoners	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
separate	1
from	1
the	1
rest,	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
been	1
abandoned.	1
All	1
who	1
could	1
walk	1
went	1
together,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
third	1
stage	1
Pierre	1
had	1
rejoined	1
Karataev	1
and	1
the	1
gray-blue	1
bandy-legged	1
dog	1
that	1
had	1
chosen	1
Karataev	1
for	1
its	1
master.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
leaving	1
Moscow	1
Karataev	1
again	1
fell	1
ill	1
with	1
the	1
fever	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
grew	1
gradually	1
weaker	1
Pierre	1
kept	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
why,	1
but	1
since	1
Karataev	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
grow	1
weaker	1
it	1
had	1
cost	1
him	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
go	1
near	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
subdued	1
moaning	1
with	1
which	1
Karataev	1
generally	1
lay	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
halting	1
places,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
smelled	1
the	1
odor	1
emanating	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
stronger	1
than	1
before,	1
Pierre	1
moved	1
farther	1
away	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
While	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
Pierre	1
had	1
learned	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
intellect	1
but	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
being,	1
by	1
life	1
itself,	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
created	1
for	1
happiness,	1
that	1
happiness	1
is	1
within	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
simple	1
human	1
needs,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
unhappiness	1
arises	1
not	1
from	1
privation	1
but	1
from	1
superfluity.	1
And	1
now	1
during	1
these	1
last	1
three	1
weeks	1
of	1
the	1
march	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
still	1
another	1
new,	1
consolatory	1
truth--that	1
nothing	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
terrible.	1
He	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
entirely	1
free,	1
so	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
need	1
be	1
unhappy	1
and	1
lack	1
freedom.	1
He	1
learned	1
that	1
suffering	1
and	1
freedom	1
have	1
their	1
limits	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
limits	1
are	1
very	1
near	1
together;	1
that	1
the	1
person	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
roses	1
with	1
one	1
crumpled	1
petal	1
suffered	1
as	1
keenly	1
as	1
he	1
now,	1
sleeping	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
damp	1
earth	1
with	1
one	1
side	1
growing	1
chilled	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
warming;	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
tight	1
dancing	1
shoes	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
bare	1
feet	1
that	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
sores--his	1
footgear	1
having	1
long	1
since	1
fallen	1
to	1
pieces.	1
He	1
discovered	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
his	1
wife--of	1
his	1
own	1
free	1
will	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him--he	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
more	1
free	1
than	1
now	1
when	1
they	1
locked	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
stable.	1
Of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
subsequently	1
termed	1
his	1
sufferings,	1
but	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
scarcely	1
felt,	1
the	1
worst	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
bare,	1
raw,	1
and	1
scab-covered	1
feet.	1
(The	1
horseflesh	1
was	1
appetizing	1
and	1
nourishing,	1
the	1
saltpeter	1
flavor	1
of	1
the	1
gunpowder	1
they	1
used	1
instead	1
of	1
salt	1
was	1
even	1
pleasant;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
great	1
cold,	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
warm	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
daytime,	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
campfires;	1
the	1
lice	1
that	1
devoured	1
him	1
warmed	1
his	1
body.)	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
hard	1
to	1
bear	1
was	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
second	1
day's	1
march	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
examined	1
his	1
feet	1
by	1
the	1
campfire,	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
walk	1
on	1
them;	1
but	1
when	1
everybody	1
got	1
up	1
he	1
went	1
along,	1
limping,	1
and,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
warmed	1
up,	1
walked	1
without	1
feeling	1
the	1
pain,	1
though	1
at	1
night	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
more	1
terrible	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
than	1
before.	1
However,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
now,	1
but	1
thought	1
of	1
other	1
things.	1
	1
Only	1
now	1
did	1
Pierre	1
realize	1
the	1
full	1
strength	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
saving	1
power	1
he	1
has	1
of	1
transferring	1
his	1
attention	1
from	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
another,	1
which	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
safety	1
valve	1
of	1
a	1
boiler	1
that	1
allows	1
superfluous	1
steam	1
to	1
blow	1
off	1
when	1
the	1
pressure	1
exceeds	1
a	1
certain	1
limit.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
how	1
they	1
shot	1
the	1
prisoners	1
who	1
lagged	1
behind,	1
though	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
perished	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
Karataev	1
who	1
grew	1
weaker	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
evidently	1
would	1
soon	1
have	1
to	1
share	1
that	1
fate.	1
Still	1
less	1
did	1
Pierre	1
think	1
about	1
himself.	1
The	1
harder	1
his	1
position	1
became	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
terrible	1
the	1
future,	1
the	1
more	1
independent	1
of	1
that	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
were	1
the	1
joyful	1
and	1
comforting	1
thoughts,	1
memories,	1
and	1
imaginings	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
him.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
At	1
midday	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-second	1
of	1
October	1
Pierre	1
was	1
going	1
uphill	1
along	1
the	1
muddy,	1
slippery	1
road,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
roughness	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
Occasionally	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
familiar	1
crowd	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
The	1
former	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
were	1
alike	1
familiar	1
and	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
blue-gray	1
bandy	1
legged	1
dog	1
ran	1
merrily	1
along	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
sometimes	1
in	1
proof	1
of	1
its	1
agility	1
and	1
self-satisfaction	1
lifting	1
one	1
hind	1
leg	1
and	1
hopping	1
along	1
on	1
three,	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
going	1
on	1
all	1
four	1
and	1
rushing	1
to	1
bark	1
at	1
the	1
crows	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
carrion.	1
The	1
dog	1
was	1
merrier	1
and	1
sleeker	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
All	1
around	1
lay	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
different	1
animals--from	1
men	1
to	1
horses--in	1
various	1
stages	1
of	1
decomposition;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
wolves	1
were	1
kept	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
passing	1
men	1
the	1
dog	1
could	1
eat	1
all	1
it	1
wanted.	1
	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
raining	1
since	1
morning	1
and	1
had	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
it	1
might	1
cease	1
and	1
the	1
sky	1
clear,	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
break	1
it	1
began	1
raining	1
harder	1
than	1
before.	1
The	1
saturated	1
road	1
no	1
longer	1
absorbed	1
the	1
water,	1
which	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
ruts	1
in	1
streams.	1
	1
Pierre	1
walked	1
along,	1
looking	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
counting	1
his	1
steps	1
in	1
threes,	1
and	1
reckoning	1
them	1
off	1
on	1
his	1
fingers.	1
Mentally	1
addressing	1
the	1
rain,	1
he	1
repeated:	1
"Now	1
then,	1
now	1
then,	1
go	1
on!	1
Pelt	1
harder!"	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing,	1
but	1
far	1
down	1
and	1
deep	1
within	1
him	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
occupied	1
with	1
something	1
important	1
and	1
comforting.	1
This	1
something	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
subtle	1
spiritual	1
deduction	1
from	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
Karataev	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
	1
At	1
their	1
yesterday's	1
halting	1
place,	1
feeling	1
chilly	1
by	1
a	1
dying	1
campfire,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
one,	1
which	1
was	1
burning	1
better.	1
There	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
was	1
sitting	1
covered	1
up--head	1
and	1
all--with	1
his	1
greatcoat	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
vestment,	1
telling	1
the	1
soldiers	1
in	1
his	1
effective	1
and	1
pleasant	1
though	1
now	1
feeble	1
voice	1
a	1
story	1
Pierre	1
knew.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
past	1
midnight,	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
Karataev	1
was	1
usually	1
free	1
of	1
his	1
fever	1
and	1
particularly	1
lively.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
reached	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
heard	1
Platon's	1
voice	1
enfeebled	1
by	1
illness,	1
and	1
saw	1
his	1
pathetic	1
face	1
brightly	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
blaze,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
painful	1
prick	1
at	1
his	1
heart.	1
His	1
feeling	1
of	1
pity	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
frightened	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
fire,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down,	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Platon.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"How	1
am	1
I?	1
If	1
we	1
grumble	1
at	1
sickness,	1
God	1
won't	1
grant	1
us	1
death,"	1
replied	1
Platon,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
resumed	1
the	1
story	1
he	1
had	1
begun.	1
	1
"And	1
so,	1
brother,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
pale	1
emaciated	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
particularly	1
happy	1
light	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
"you	1
see,	1
brother..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
familiar	1
with	1
that	1
story.	1
Karataev	1
had	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
alone	1
some	1
half-dozen	1
times	1
and	1
always	1
with	1
a	1
specially	1
joyful	1
emotion.	1
But	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
it,	1
Pierre	1
now	1
listened	1
to	1
that	1
tale	1
as	1
to	1
something	1
new,	1
and	1
the	1
quiet	1
rapture	1
Karataev	1
evidently	1
felt	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
it	1
communicated	1
itself	1
also	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
story	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
merchant	1
who	1
lived	1
a	1
good	1
and	1
God-fearing	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
who	1
went	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
Nizhni	1
fair	1
with	1
a	1
companion--a	1
rich	1
merchant.	1
	1
Having	1
put	1
up	1
at	1
an	1
inn	1
they	1
both	1
went	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
next	1
morning	1
his	1
companion	1
was	1
found	1
robbed	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
throat	1
cut.	1
A	1
bloodstained	1
knife	1
was	1
found	1
under	1
the	1
old	1
merchant's	1
pillow.	1
He	1
was	1
tried,	1
knouted,	1
and	1
his	1
nostrils	1
having	1
been	1
torn	1
off,	1
"all	1
in	1
due	1
form"	1
as	1
Karataev	1
put	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
hard	1
labor	1
in	1
Siberia.	1
	1
"And	1
so,	1
brother"	1
(it	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
that	1
Pierre	1
came	1
up),	1
"ten	1
years	1
or	1
more	1
passed	1
by.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
living	1
as	1
a	1
convict,	1
submitting	1
as	1
he	1
should	1
and	1
doing	1
no	1
wrong.	1
Only	1
he	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
death.	1
Well,	1
one	1
night	1
the	1
convicts	1
were	1
gathered	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
among	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
telling	1
what	1
each	1
was	1
suffering	1
for,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
sinned	1
against	1
God.	1
One	1
told	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
life,	1
another	1
had	1
taken	1
two,	1
a	1
third	1
had	1
set	1
a	1
house	1
on	1
fire,	1
while	1
another	1
had	1
simply	1
been	1
a	1
vagrant	1
and	1
had	1
done	1
nothing.	1
So	1
they	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
man:	1
'What	1
are	1
you	1
being	1
punished	1
for,	1
Daddy?'--'I,	1
my	1
dear	1
brothers,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'am	1
being	1
punished	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
and	1
other	1
men's	1
sins.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
killed	1
anyone	1
or	1
taken	1
anything	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
mine,	1
but	1
have	1
only	1
helped	1
my	1
poorer	1
brothers.	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
merchant,	1
my	1
dear	1
brothers,	1
and	1
had	1
much	1
property.	1
'And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
due	1
order.	1
'I	1
don't	1
grieve	1
for	1
myself,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'God,	1
it	1
seems,	1
has	1
chastened	1
me.	1
Only	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
my	1
old	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
children,'	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
weep.	1
Now	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
group	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
killed	1
the	1
other	1
merchant.	1
'Where	1
did	1
it	1
happen,	1
Daddy?'	1
he	1
said.	1
'When,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
month?'	1
He	1
asked	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
began	1
to	1
ache.	1
So	1
he	1
comes	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
like	1
this,	1
and	1
falls	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet!	1
'You	1
are	1
perishing	1
because	1
of	1
me,	1
Daddy,'	1
he	1
says.	1
'It's	1
quite	1
true,	1
lads,	1
that	1
this	1
man,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'is	1
being	1
tortured	1
innocently	1
and	1
for	1
nothing!	1
I,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'did	1
that	1
deed,	1
and	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
knife	1
under	1
your	1
head	1
while	1
you	1
were	1
asleep.	1
Forgive	1
me,	1
Daddy,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'for	1
Christ's	1
sake!'"	1
	1
Karataev	1
paused,	1
smiling	1
joyously	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
the	1
logs	1
together.	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
said,	1
'God	1
will	1
forgive	1
you,	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
sinners	1
in	1
His	1
sight.	1
I	1
suffer	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sins,'	1
and	1
he	1
wept	1
bitter	1
tears.	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
dear	1
friends?"	1
Karataev	1
continued,	1
his	1
face	1
brightening	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
with	1
a	1
rapturous	1
smile	1
as	1
if	1
what	1
he	1
now	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
contained	1
the	1
chief	1
charm	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
story:	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
dear	1
fellows?	1
That	1
murderer	1
confessed	1
to	1
the	1
authorities.	1
'I	1
have	1
taken	1
six	1
lives,'	1
he	1
says	1
(he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
sinner),	1
'but	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
most	1
sorry	1
for	1
is	1
this	1
old	1
man.	1
Don't	1
let	1
him	1
suffer	1
because	1
of	1
me.'	1
So	1
he	1
confessed	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
written	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
papers	1
sent	1
off	1
in	1
due	1
form.	1
The	1
place	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
off,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
judging,	1
what	1
with	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
another,	1
filling	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
all	1
in	1
due	1
form--the	1
authorities	1
I	1
mean--time	1
passed.	1
The	1
affair	1
reached	1
the	1
Tsar.	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
decree	1
came:	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
merchant	1
free	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
compensation	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
awarded.	1
The	1
paper	1
arrived	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
man.	1
'Where	1
is	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
suffering	1
innocently	1
and	1
in	1
vain?	1
A	1
paper	1
has	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
Tsar!'	1
so	1
they	1
began	1
looking	1
for	1
him,"	1
here	1
Karataev's	1
lower	1
jaw	1
trembled,	1
"but	1
God	1
had	1
already	1
forgiven	1
him--he	1
was	1
dead!	1
That's	1
how	1
it	1
was,	1
dear	1
fellows!"	1
Karataev	1
concluded	1
and	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
silent,	1
gazing	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
And	1
Pierre's	1
soul	1
was	1
dimly	1
but	1
joyfully	1
filled	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
story	1
itself	1
but	1
by	1
its	1
mysterious	1
significance:	1
by	1
the	1
rapturous	1
joy	1
that	1
lit	1
up	1
Karataev's	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
mystic	1
significance	1
of	1
that	1
joy.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
"A	1
vos	1
places!"	1
*	1
suddenly	1
cried	1
a	1
voice.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"To	1
your	1
places."	1
	1
A	1
pleasant	1
feeling	1
of	1
excitement	1
and	1
an	1
expectation	1
of	1
something	1
joyful	1
and	1
solemn	1
was	1
aroused	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
convoy	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners.	1
From	1
all	1
sides	1
came	1
shouts	1
of	1
command,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
left	1
came	1
smartly	1
dressed	1
cavalrymen	1
on	1
good	1
horses,	1
passing	1
the	1
prisoners	1
at	1
a	1
trot.	1
The	1
expression	1
on	1
all	1
faces	1
showed	1
the	1
tension	1
people	1
feel	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
authority.	1
The	1
prisoners	1
thronged	1
together	1
and	1
were	1
pushed	1
off	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
convoy	1
formed	1
up.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor!	1
The	1
Emperor!	1
The	1
Marshal!	1
The	1
Duke!"	1
and	1
hardly	1
had	1
the	1
sleek	1
cavalry	1
passed,	1
before	1
a	1
carriage	1
drawn	1
by	1
six	1
gray	1
horses	1
rattled	1
by.	1
Pierre	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
three-cornered	1
hat	1
with	1
a	1
tranquil	1
look	1
on	1
his	1
handsome,	1
plump,	1
white	1
face.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
marshals.	1
His	1
eye	1
fell	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
large	1
and	1
striking	1
figure,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
looked	1
away	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
he	1
detected	1
sympathy	1
and	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
conceal	1
that	1
sympathy.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
stores	1
galloped	1
after	1
the	1
carriage	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
and	1
frightened	1
face,	1
whipping	1
up	1
his	1
skinny	1
horse.	1
Several	1
officers	1
formed	1
a	1
group	1
and	1
some	1
soldiers	1
crowded	1
round	1
them.	1
Their	1
faces	1
all	1
looked	1
excited	1
and	1
worried.	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
he	1
say?	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
say?"	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
them	1
ask.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
marshal	1
was	1
passing,	1
the	1
prisoners	1
had	1
huddled	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
crowd,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
Karataev	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
that	1
morning.	1
He	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
short	1
overcoat	1
leaning	1
against	1
a	1
birch	1
tree.	1
On	1
his	1
face,	1
besides	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
joyful	1
emotion	1
it	1
had	1
worn	1
yesterday	1
while	1
telling	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
the	1
merchant	1
who	1
suffered	1
innocently,	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
quiet	1
solemnity.	1
	1
Karataev	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
his	1
kindly	1
round	1
eyes	1
now	1
filled	1
with	1
tears,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
was	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
sure	1
of	1
himself.	1
He	1
made	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
that	1
look	1
and	1
moved	1
hastily	1
away.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
prisoners	1
again	1
went	1
forward	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
round.	1
Karataev	1
was	1
still	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
under	1
the	1
birch	1
tree	1
and	1
two	1
Frenchmen	1
were	1
talking	1
over	1
his	1
head.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round	1
again	1
but	1
went	1
limping	1
up	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
From	1
behind,	1
where	1
Karataev	1
had	1
been	1
sitting,	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
shot.	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
it	1
plainly,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
finished	1
reckoning	1
up	1
how	1
many	1
stages	1
still	1
remained	1
to	1
Smolensk--a	1
calculation	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
before	1
the	1
marshal	1
went	1
by.	1
And	1
he	1
again	1
started	1
reckoning.	1
Two	1
French	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
past	1
Pierre,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
carried	1
a	1
lowered	1
and	1
smoking	1
gun.	1
They	1
both	1
looked	1
pale,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
their	1
faces--one	1
of	1
them	1
glanced	1
timidly	1
at	1
Pierre--	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
resembling	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
soldier	1
at	1
the	1
execution.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
soldier	1
and	1
remembered	1
that,	1
two	1
days	1
before,	1
that	1
man	1
had	1
burned	1
his	1
shirt	1
while	1
drying	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
laughed	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
Behind	1
him,	1
where	1
Karataev	1
had	1
been	1
sitting,	1
the	1
dog	1
began	1
to	1
howl.	1
"What	1
a	1
stupid	1
beast!	1
Why	1
is	1
it	1
howling?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
	1
His	1
comrades,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
soldiers	1
walking	1
beside	1
him,	1
avoided	1
looking	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
shot	1
had	1
been	1
fired	1
and	1
the	1
dog	1
was	1
howling,	1
just	1
as	1
Pierre	1
did,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
set	1
look	1
on	1
all	1
their	1
faces.	1
	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
The	1
stores,	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
the	1
marshal's	1
baggage	1
train	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Shamshevo.	1
The	1
men	1
crowded	1
together	1
round	1
the	1
campfires.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
ate	1
some	1
roast	1
horseflesh,	1
lay	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
immediately	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
He	1
again	1
slept	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
Mozhaysk	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
	1
Again	1
real	1
events	1
mingled	1
with	1
dreams	1
and	1
again	1
someone,	1
he	1
or	1
another,	1
gave	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
expressed	1
in	1
his	1
dream	1
at	1
Mozhaysk.	1
	1
"Life	1
is	1
everything.	1
Life	1
is	1
God.	1
Everything	1
changes	1
and	1
moves	1
and	1
that	1
movement	1
is	1
God.	1
And	1
while	1
there	1
is	1
life	1
there	1
is	1
joy	1
in	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
divine.	1
To	1
love	1
life	1
is	1
to	1
love	1
God.	1
Harder	1
and	1
more	1
blessed	1
than	1
all	1
else	1
is	1
to	1
love	1
this	1
life	1
in	1
one's	1
sufferings,	1
in	1
innocent	1
sufferings."	1
	1
"Karataev!"	1
came	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
mind.	1
	1
And	1
suddenly	1
he	1
saw	1
vividly	1
before	1
him	1
a	1
long-forgotten,	1
kindly	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
geography	1
lessons	1
in	1
Switzerland.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
showed	1
Pierre	1
a	1
globe.	1
This	1
globe	1
was	1
alive--a	1
vibrating	1
ball	1
without	1
fixed	1
dimensions.	1
Its	1
whole	1
surface	1
consisted	1
of	1
drops	1
closely	1
pressed	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
drops	1
moved	1
and	1
changed	1
places,	1
sometimes	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
merging	1
into	1
one,	1
sometimes	1
one	1
dividing	1
into	1
many.	1
Each	1
drop	1
tried	1
to	1
spread	1
out	1
and	1
occupy	1
as	1
much	1
space	1
as	1
possible,	1
but	1
others	1
striving	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
compressed	1
it,	1
sometimes	1
destroyed	1
it,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
merged	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
life,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
teacher.	1
	1
"How	1
simple	1
and	1
clear	1
it	1
is,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
before?"	1
	1
"God	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
each	1
drop	1
tries	1
to	1
expand	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
reflect	1
Him	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
extent.	1
And	1
it	1
grows,	1
merges,	1
disappears	1
from	1
the	1
surface,	1
sinks	1
to	1
the	1
depths,	1
and	1
again	1
emerges.	1
There	1
now,	1
Karataev	1
has	1
spread	1
out	1
and	1
disappeared.	1
Do	1
you	1
understand,	1
my	1
child?"	1
said	1
the	1
teacher.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
understand,	1
damn	1
you?"	1
shouted	1
a	1
voice,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
woke	1
up.	1
	1
He	1
lifted	1
himself	1
and	1
sat	1
up.	1
A	1
Frenchman	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
pushed	1
a	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
away	1
was	1
squatting	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
engaged	1
in	1
roasting	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
meat	1
stuck	1
on	1
a	1
ramrod.	1
His	1
sleeves	1
were	1
rolled	1
up	1
and	1
his	1
sinewy,	1
hairy,	1
red	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
short	1
fingers	1
deftly	1
turned	1
the	1
ramrod.	1
His	1
brown	1
morose	1
face	1
with	1
frowning	1
brows	1
was	1
clearly	1
visible	1
by	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
charcoal.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
him,"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
turning	1
quickly	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
stood	1
behind	1
him.	1
"Brigand!	1
Get	1
away!"	1
	1
And	1
twisting	1
the	1
ramrod	1
he	1
looked	1
gloomily	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
gazed	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
A	1
prisoner,	1
the	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
pushed	1
away,	1
was	1
sitting	1
near	1
the	1
fire	1
patting	1
something	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
Looking	1
more	1
closely	1
Pierre	1
recognized	1
the	1
blue-gray	1
dog,	1
sitting	1
beside	1
the	1
soldier,	1
wagging	1
its	1
tail.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
he's	1
come?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"And	1
Plat-"	1
he	1
began,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
finish.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
and	1
simultaneously	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
memories	1
awoke	1
in	1
his	1
fancy--of	1
the	1
look	1
Platon	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
under	1
the	1
tree,	1
of	1
the	1
shot	1
heard	1
from	1
that	1
spot,	1
of	1
the	1
dog's	1
howl,	1
of	1
the	1
guilty	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
Frenchmen	1
as	1
they	1
ran	1
past	1
him,	1
of	1
the	1
lowered	1
and	1
smoking	1
gun,	1
and	1
of	1
Karataev's	1
absence	1
at	1
this	1
halt--and	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
realizing	1
that	1
Karataev	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
but	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
instant,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
why,	1
the	1
recollection	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
of	1
a	1
summer	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
with	1
a	1
beautiful	1
Polish	1
lady	1
on	1
the	1
veranda	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
Kiev.	1
And	1
without	1
linking	1
up	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
or	1
drawing	1
a	1
conclusion	1
from	1
them,	1
Pierre	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
seeing	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
summertime	1
mingled	1
with	1
memories	1
of	1
bathing	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
liquid,	1
vibrating	1
globe,	1
and	1
he	1
sank	1
into	1
water	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
closed	1
over	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
Before	1
sunrise	1
he	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
shouts	1
and	1
loud	1
and	1
rapid	1
firing.	1
French	1
soldiers	1
were	1
running	1
past	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
Cossacks!"	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
shouted,	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
Russians	1
surrounded	1
Pierre.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
to	1
him.	1
All	1
around	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
comrades	1
sobbing	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
"Brothers!	1
Dear	1
fellows!	1
Darlings!"	1
old	1
soldiers	1
exclaimed,	1
weeping,	1
as	1
they	1
embraced	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
hussars.	1
	1
The	1
hussars	1
and	1
Cossacks	1
crowded	1
round	1
the	1
prisoners;	1
one	1
offered	1
them	1
clothes,	1
another	1
boots,	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
bread.	1
Pierre	1
sobbed	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
a	1
word.	1
He	1
hugged	1
the	1
first	1
soldier	1
who	1
approached	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
weeping.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
ruined	1
house,	1
letting	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
disarmed	1
Frenchmen	1
pass	1
by.	1
The	1
French,	1
excited	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened,	1
were	1
talking	1
loudly	1
among	1
themselves,	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
Dolokhov	1
who	1
gently	1
switched	1
his	1
boots	1
with	1
his	1
whip	1
and	1
watched	1
them	1
with	1
cold	1
glassy	1
eyes	1
that	1
boded	1
no	1
good,	1
they	1
became	1
silent.	1
On	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
stood	1
Dolokhov's	1
Cossack,	1
counting	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
marking	1
off	1
each	1
hundred	1
with	1
a	1
chalk	1
line	1
on	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
"How	1
many?"	1
Dolokhov	1
asked	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"The	1
second	1
hundred,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"Filez,	1
filez!"	1
*	1
Dolokhov	1
kept	1
saying,	1
having	1
adopted	1
this	1
expression	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
eyes	1
met	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
they	1
flashed	1
with	1
a	1
cruel	1
light.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Get	1
along,	1
get	1
along!"	1
	1
Denisov,	1
bareheaded	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
face,	1
walked	1
behind	1
some	1
Cossacks	1
who	1
were	1
carrying	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Petya	1
Rostov	1
to	1
a	1
hole	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
dug	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
After	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
of	1
October	1
when	1
the	1
frosts	1
began,	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
assumed	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
tragic	1
character,	1
with	1
men	1
freezing,	1
or	1
roasting	1
themselves	1
to	1
death	1
at	1
the	1
campfires,	1
while	1
carriages	1
with	1
people	1
dressed	1
in	1
furs	1
continued	1
to	1
drive	1
past,	1
carrying	1
away	1
the	1
property	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
stolen	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
kings,	1
and	1
dukes;	1
but	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
the	1
flight	1
and	1
disintegration	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
went	1
on	1
essentially	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
From	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Vyazma	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
of	1
seventy-three	1
thousand	1
men	1
not	1
reckoning	1
the	1
Guards	1
(who	1
did	1
nothing	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
war	1
but	1
pillage)	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
thirty-six	1
thousand,	1
though	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
thousand	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
battle.	1
From	1
this	1
beginning	1
the	1
succeeding	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
progression	1
could	1
be	1
determined	1
mathematically.	1
The	1
French	1
army	1
melted	1
away	1
and	1
perished	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
rate	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Vyazma,	1
from	1
Vyazma	1
to	1
Smolensk,	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
to	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Berezina	1
to	1
Vilna-	1
-independently	1
of	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
intensity	1
of	1
the	1
cold,	1
the	1
pursuit,	1
the	1
barring	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
particular	1
conditions.	1
Beyond	1
Vyazma	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
instead	1
of	1
moving	1
in	1
three	1
columns	1
huddled	1
together	1
into	1
one	1
mass,	1
and	1
so	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
end.	1
Berthier	1
wrote	1
to	1
his	1
Emperor	1
(we	1
know	1
how	1
far	1
commanding	1
officers	1
allow	1
themselves	1
to	1
diverge	1
from	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
describing	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
an	1
army)	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
said:	1
	1
I	1
deem	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
report	1
to	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
corps	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
occasion	1
to	1
observe	1
during	1
different	1
stages	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days'	1
march.	1
They	1
are	1
almost	1
disbanded.	1
Scarcely	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
remain	1
with	1
the	1
standards	1
of	1
their	1
regiments,	1
the	1
others	1
go	1
off	1
by	1
themselves	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
food	1
and	1
escape	1
discipline.	1
In	1
general	1
they	1
regard	1
Smolensk	1
as	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
hope	1
to	1
recover.	1
During	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
seen	1
to	1
throw	1
away	1
their	1
cartridges	1
and	1
their	1
arms.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
affairs,	1
whatever	1
your	1
ultimate	1
plans	1
may	1
be,	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
Your	1
Majesty's	1
service	1
demands	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
should	1
be	1
rallied	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
should	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
be	1
freed	1
from	1
ineffectives,	1
such	1
as	1
dismounted	1
cavalry,	1
unnecessary	1
baggage,	1
and	1
artillery	1
material	1
that	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
forces.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
are	1
worn	1
out	1
with	1
hunger	1
and	1
fatigue,	1
need	1
these	1
supplies	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
few	1
days'	1
rest.	1
Many	1
have	1
died	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
bivouacs.	1
This	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
is	1
continually	1
becoming	1
worse	1
and	1
makes	1
one	1
fear	1
that	1
unless	1
a	1
prompt	1
remedy	1
is	1
applied	1
the	1
troops	1
will	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
under	1
control	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
an	1
engagement.	1
	1
November	1
9:	1
twenty	1
miles	1
from	1
Smolensk.	1
	1
After	1
staggering	1
into	1
Smolensk	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
promised	1
land,	1
the	1
French,	1
searching	1
for	1
food,	1
killed	1
one	1
another,	1
sacked	1
their	1
own	1
stores,	1
and	1
when	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
plundered	1
fled	1
farther.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
went	1
without	1
knowing	1
whither	1
or	1
why	1
they	1
were	1
going.	1
Still	1
less	1
did	1
that	1
genius,	1
Napoleon,	1
know	1
it,	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
issued	1
any	1
orders	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
and	1
those	1
about	1
him	1
retained	1
their	1
old	1
habits:	1
wrote	1
commands,	1
letters,	1
reports,	1
and	1
orders	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
called	1
one	1
another	1
sire,	1
mon	1
cousin,	1
prince	1
d'Eckmuhl,	1
roi	1
de	1
Naples,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
But	1
these	1
orders	1
and	1
reports	1
were	1
only	1
on	1
paper,	1
nothing	1
in	1
them	1
was	1
acted	1
upon	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
carried	1
out,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
entitled	1
one	1
another	1
Majesties,	1
Highnesses,	1
or	1
Cousins,	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
miserable	1
wretches	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
much	1
evil	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
now	1
to	1
pay.	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
concerned	1
about	1
the	1
army,	1
each	1
was	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
quickly	1
and	1
save	1
himself.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
The	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
armies	1
during	1
the	1
campaign	1
from	1
Moscow	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Niemen	1
were	1
like	1
those	1
in	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
Russian	1
blindman's	1
bluff,	1
in	1
which	1
two	1
players	1
are	1
blindfolded	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
occasionally	1
rings	1
a	1
little	1
bell	1
to	1
inform	1
the	1
catcher	1
of	1
his	1
whereabouts.	1
First	1
he	1
rings	1
his	1
bell	1
fearlessly,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
gets	1
into	1
a	1
tight	1
place	1
he	1
runs	1
away	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
he	1
can,	1
and	1
often	1
thinking	1
to	1
escape	1
runs	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
opponent's	1
arms.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
moving	1
along	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
Napoleon's	1
armies	1
made	1
their	1
presence	1
known,	1
but	1
later	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road	1
they	1
ran	1
holding	1
the	1
clapper	1
of	1
their	1
bell	1
tight--and	1
often	1
thinking	1
they	1
were	1
escaping	1
ran	1
right	1
into	1
the	1
Russians.	1
	1
Owing	1
to	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
flight	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
pursuit	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
exhaustion	1
of	1
the	1
horses,	1
the	1
chief	1
means	1
of	1
approximately	1
ascertaining	1
the	1
enemy's	1
position--by	1
cavalry	1
scouting--	1
was	1
not	1
available.	1
Besides,	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
frequent	1
and	1
rapid	1
change	1
of	1
position	1
by	1
each	1
army,	1
even	1
what	1
information	1
was	1
obtained	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
in	1
time.	1
If	1
news	1
was	1
received	1
one	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
position	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
by	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
when	1
something	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
done,	1
that	1
army	1
was	1
already	1
two	1
days'	1
march	1
farther	1
on	1
and	1
in	1
quite	1
another	1
position.	1
	1
One	1
army	1
fled	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
pursued.	1
Beyond	1
Smolensk	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
different	1
roads	1
available	1
for	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
during	1
their	1
stay	1
of	1
four	1
days	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
learned	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
was,	1
might	1
have	1
arranged	1
some	1
more	1
advantageous	1
plan	1
and	1
undertaken	1
something	1
new.	1
But	1
after	1
a	1
four	1
days'	1
halt	1
the	1
mob,	1
with	1
no	1
maneuvers	1
or	1
plans,	1
again	1
began	1
running	1
along	1
the	1
beaten	1
track,	1
neither	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
but	1
along	1
the	1
old--the	1
worst--road,	1
through	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
Orsha.	1
	1
Expecting	1
the	1
enemy	1
from	1
behind	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
front,	1
the	1
French	1
separated	1
in	1
their	1
flight	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
over	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
twenty-four	1
hours.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
fled	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
then	1
the	1
kings,	1
then	1
the	1
dukes.	1
The	1
Russian	1
army,	1
expecting	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
beyond	1
the	1
Dnieper--which	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
reasonable	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do--	1
themselves	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
highroad	1
at	1
Krasnoe.	1
And	1
here	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
blindman's	1
buff	1
the	1
French	1
ran	1
into	1
our	1
vanguard.	1
Seeing	1
their	1
enemy	1
unexpectedly	1
the	1
French	1
fell	1
into	1
confusion	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
from	1
the	1
sudden	1
fright,	1
but	1
then	1
they	1
resumed	1
their	1
flight,	1
abandoning	1
their	1
comrades	1
who	1
were	1
farther	1
behind.	1
Then	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
separate	1
portions	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army--first	1
Murat's	1
(the	1
vice-king's),	1
then	1
Davout's,	1
and	1
then	1
Ney's--ran,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
the	1
gauntlet	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army.	1
They	1
abandoned	1
one	1
another,	1
abandoned	1
all	1
their	1
heavy	1
baggage,	1
their	1
artillery,	1
and	1
half	1
their	1
men,	1
and	1
fled,	1
getting	1
past	1
the	1
Russians	1
by	1
night	1
by	1
making	1
semicircles	1
to	1
the	1
right.	1
	1
Ney,	1
who	1
came	1
last,	1
had	1
been	1
busying	1
himself	1
blowing	1
up	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Smolensk	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
nobody's	1
way,	1
because	1
despite	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
plight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
or	1
because	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
floor	1
against	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
hurt	1
themselves.	1
Ney,	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
corps	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men,	1
reached	1
Napoleon	1
at	1
Orsha	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
thousand	1
men	1
left,	1
having	1
abandoned	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
cannon,	1
and	1
having	1
crossed	1
the	1
Dnieper	1
at	1
night	1
by	1
stealth	1
at	1
a	1
wooded	1
spot.	1
	1
From	1
Orsha	1
they	1
fled	1
farther	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Vilna,	1
still	1
playing	1
at	1
blindman's	1
buff	1
with	1
the	1
pursuing	1
army.	1
At	1
the	1
Berezina	1
they	1
again	1
became	1
disorganized,	1
many	1
were	1
drowned	1
and	1
many	1
surrendered,	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
got	1
across	1
the	1
river	1
fled	1
farther.	1
Their	1
supreme	1
chief	1
donned	1
a	1
fur	1
coat	1
and,	1
having	1
seated	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
sleigh,	1
galloped	1
on	1
alone,	1
abandoning	1
his	1
companions.	1
The	1
others	1
who	1
could	1
do	1
so	1
drove	1
away	1
too,	1
leaving	1
those	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
to	1
surrender	1
or	1
die.	1
	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
This	1
campaign	1
consisted	1
in	1
a	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
during	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
to	1
destroy	1
themselves.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
turned	1
onto	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
their	1
leader	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
army,	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
had	1
any	1
sense.	1
So	1
one	1
might	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
regarding	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
the	1
historians,	1
who	1
attributed	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
retreat	1
fit	1
their	1
theory.	1
But	1
no!	1
Mountains	1
of	1
books	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
historians	1
about	1
this	1
campaign,	1
and	1
everywhere	1
are	1
described	1
Napoleon's	1
arrangements,	1
the	1
maneuvers,	1
and	1
his	1
profound	1
plans	1
which	1
guided	1
the	1
army,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
military	1
genius	1
shown	1
by	1
his	1
marshals.	1
	1
The	1
retreat	1
from	1
Malo-Yaroslavets	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
free	1
road	1
into	1
a	1
well-	1
supplied	1
district	1
and	1
the	1
parallel	1
road	1
was	1
open	1
to	1
him	1
along	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
afterwards	1
pursued	1
him--this	1
unnecessary	1
retreat	1
along	1
a	1
devastated	1
road--is	1
explained	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
being	1
due	1
to	1
profound	1
considerations.	1
Similarly	1
profound	1
considerations	1
are	1
given	1
for	1
his	1
retreat	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
to	1
Orsha.	1
Then	1
his	1
heroism	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
is	1
described,	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
reported	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
prepared	1
to	1
accept	1
battle	1
and	1
take	1
personal	1
command,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
walked	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
birch	1
stick	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"J'ai	1
assez	1
fait	1
l'empereur;	1
il	1
est	1
temps	1
de	1
faire	1
le	1
general,"	1
*	1
but	1
nevertheless	1
immediately	1
ran	1
away	1
again,	1
abandoning	1
to	1
its	1
fate	1
the	1
scattered	1
fragments	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
left	1
behind.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"I	1
have	1
acted	1
the	1
Emperor	1
long	1
enough;	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
act	1
the	1
general."	1
	1
Then	1
we	1
are	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
marshals,	1
especially	1
of	1
Ney--a	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul	1
consisting	1
in	1
this:	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
by	1
night	1
around	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
across	1
the	1
Dnieper	1
and	1
escaped	1
to	1
Orsha,	1
abandoning	1
standards,	1
artillery,	1
and	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
his	1
men.	1
	1
And	1
lastly,	1
the	1
final	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Emperor	1
from	1
his	1
heroic	1
army	1
is	1
presented	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
historians	1
as	1
something	1
great	1
and	1
characteristic	1
of	1
genius.	1
Even	1
that	1
final	1
running	1
away,	1
described	1
in	1
ordinary	1
language	1
as	1
the	1
lowest	1
depth	1
of	1
baseness	1
which	1
every	1
child	1
is	1
taught	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of--even	1
that	1
act	1
finds	1
justification	1
in	1
the	1
historians'	1
language.	1
	1
When	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
stretch	1
the	1
very	1
elastic	1
threads	1
of	1
historical	1
ratiocination	1
any	1
farther,	1
when	1
actions	1
are	1
clearly	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
humanity	1
calls	1
right	1
or	1
even	1
just,	1
the	1
historians	1
produce	1
a	1
saving	1
conception	1
of	1
"greatness."	1
"Greatness,"	1
it	1
seems,	1
excludes	1
the	1
standards	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong.	1
For	1
the	1
"great"	1
man	1
nothing	1
is	1
wrong,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
atrocity	1
for	1
which	1
a	1
"great"	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
blamed.	1
	1
"C'est	1
grand!"	1
*	1
say	1
the	1
historians,	1
and	1
there	1
no	1
longer	1
exists	1
either	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
but	1
only	1
"grand"	1
and	1
"not	1
grand."	1
Grand	1
is	1
good,	1
not	1
grand	1
is	1
bad.	1
Grand	1
is	1
the	1
characteristic,	1
in	1
their	1
conception,	1
of	1
some	1
special	1
animals	1
called	1
"heroes."	1
And	1
Napoleon,	1
escaping	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
warm	1
fur	1
coat	1
and	1
leaving	1
to	1
perish	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
merely	1
his	1
comrades	1
but	1
were	1
(in	1
his	1
opinion)	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
there,	1
feels	1
que	1
c'est	1
grand,	1
*(2)	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
tranquil.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"It	1
is	1
great."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
That	1
it	1
is	1
great.	1
	1
"Du	1
sublime	1
(he	1
saw	1
something	1
sublime	1
in	1
himself)	1
au	1
ridicule	1
il	1
n'y	1
a	1
qu'un	1
pas,"	1
*	1
said	1
he.	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
for	1
fifty	1
years	1
has	1
been	1
repeating:	1
"Sublime!	1
Grand!	1
Napoleon	1
le	1
Grand!"	1
Du	1
sublime	1
au	1
ridicule	1
il	1
n'y	1
a	1
qu'un	1
pas.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"From	1
the	1
sublime	1
to	1
the	1
ridiculous	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
step."	1
	1
And	1
it	1
occurs	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
that	1
to	1
admit	1
a	1
greatness	1
not	1
commensurable	1
with	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong	1
is	1
merely	1
to	1
admit	1
one's	1
own	1
nothingness	1
and	1
immeasurable	1
meanness.	1
	1
For	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil	1
given	1
us	1
by	1
Christ,	1
no	1
human	1
actions	1
are	1
incommensurable.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
greatness	1
where	1
simplicity,	1
goodness,	1
and	1
truth	1
are	1
absent.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
What	1
Russian,	1
reading	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812,	1
has	1
not	1
experienced	1
an	1
uncomfortable	1
feeling	1
of	1
regret,	1
dissatisfaction,	1
and	1
perplexity?	1
Who	1
has	1
not	1
asked	1
himself	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
not	1
all	1
captured	1
or	1
destroyed	1
when	1
our	1
three	1
armies	1
surrounded	1
them	1
in	1
superior	1
numbers,	1
when	1
the	1
disordered	1
French,	1
hungry	1
and	1
freezing,	1
surrendered	1
in	1
crowds,	1
and	1
when	1
(as	1
the	1
historians	1
relate)	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
was	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
French,	1
to	1
cut	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
capture	1
them	1
all?	1
	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
which	1
when	1
numerically	1
weaker	1
than	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
given	1
battle	1
at	1
Borodino,	1
did	1
not	1
achieve	1
its	1
purpose	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
surrounded	1
the	1
French	1
on	1
three	1
sides	1
and	1
when	1
its	1
aim	1
was	1
to	1
capture	1
them?	1
Can	1
the	1
French	1
be	1
so	1
enormously	1
superior	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
surrounded	1
them	1
with	1
superior	1
forces	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
beat	1
them?	1
How	1
could	1
that	1
happen?	1
	1
History	1
(or	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
that	1
name)	1
replying	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
says	1
that	1
this	1
occurred	1
because	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
Tormasov	1
and	1
Chichagov,	1
and	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
that	1
man,	1
did	1
not	1
execute	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
maneuvers...	1
	1
But	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
execute	1
those	1
maneuvers?	1
And	1
why	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
guilty	1
of	1
not	1
carrying	1
out	1
a	1
prearranged	1
plan	1
were	1
they	1
not	1
tried	1
and	1
punished?	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
admitted	1
that	1
Kutuzov,	1
Chichagov,	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
failures,	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
incomprehensible	1
why,	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
being	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
Berezina	1
(in	1
both	1
cases	1
we	1
had	1
superior	1
forces),	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
with	1
its	1
marshals,	1
kings,	1
and	1
Emperor	1
was	1
not	1
captured,	1
if	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
Russians	1
aimed	1
at.	1
	1
The	1
explanation	1
of	1
this	1
strange	1
fact	1
given	1
by	1
Russian	1
military	1
historians	1
(to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
hindered	1
an	1
attack)	1
is	1
unfounded,	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
the	1
troops	1
from	1
attacking	1
at	1
Vyazma	1
and	1
Tarutino.	1
	1
Why	1
was	1
the	1
Russian	1
army--which	1
with	1
inferior	1
forces	1
had	1
withstood	1
the	1
enemy	1
in	1
full	1
strength	1
at	1
Borodino--defeated	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
the	1
Berezina	1
by	1
the	1
disorganized	1
crowds	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
numerically	1
superior?	1
	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
consisted	1
in	1
cutting	1
off	1
and	1
capturing	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
marshals--and	1
that	1
aim	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
frustrated	1
but	1
all	1
attempts	1
to	1
attain	1
it	1
were	1
most	1
shamefully	1
baffled--then	1
this	1
last	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
is	1
quite	1
rightly	1
considered	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
victories,	1
and	1
quite	1
wrongly	1
considered	1
victorious	1
by	1
Russian	1
historians.	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
military	1
historians	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
submit	1
to	1
claims	1
of	1
logic	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
conclusion,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
their	1
lyrical	1
rhapsodies	1
about	1
valor,	1
devotion,	1
and	1
so	1
forth,	1
must	1
reluctantly	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
retreat	1
from	1
Moscow	1
was	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
victories	1
for	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
defeats	1
for	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
But	1
putting	1
national	1
vanity	1
entirely	1
aside	1
one	1
feels	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
conclusion	1
involves	1
a	1
contradiction,	1
since	1
the	1
series	1
of	1
French	1
victories	1
brought	1
the	1
French	1
complete	1
destruction,	1
while	1
the	1
series	1
of	1
Russian	1
defeats	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
total	1
destruction	1
of	1
their	1
enemy	1
and	1
the	1
liberation	1
of	1
their	1
country.	1
	1
The	1
source	1
of	1
this	1
contradiction	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
historians	1
studying	1
the	1
events	1
from	1
the	1
letters	1
of	1
the	1
sovereigns	1
and	1
the	1
generals,	1
from	1
memoirs,	1
reports,	1
projects,	1
and	1
so	1
forth,	1
have	1
attributed	1
to	1
this	1
last	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
of	1
1812	1
an	1
aim	1
that	1
never	1
existed,	1
namely	1
that	1
of	1
cutting	1
off	1
and	1
capturing	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
his	1
marshals	1
and	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
There	1
never	1
was	1
or	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
such	1
an	1
aim,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
and	1
its	1
attainment	1
quite	1
impossible.	1
	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless,	1
first	1
because	1
Napoleon's	1
disorganized	1
army	1
was	1
flying	1
from	1
Russia	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
speed,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
was	1
doing	1
just	1
what	1
every	1
Russian	1
desired.	1
So	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
performing	1
various	1
operations	1
on	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
were	1
running	1
away	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
they	1
possibly	1
could?	1
	1
Secondly,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
to	1
block	1
the	1
passage	1
of	1
men	1
whose	1
whole	1
energy	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
flight.	1
	1
Thirdly,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
one's	1
own	1
troops	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
which	1
without	1
external	1
interference	1
was	1
destroying	1
itself	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
rate	1
that,	1
though	1
its	1
path	1
was	1
not	1
blocked,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
across	1
the	1
frontier	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
actually	1
did	1
in	1
December,	1
namely	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
army.	1
	1
Fourthly,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
captive	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
kings,	1
and	1
dukes--whose	1
capture	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
embarrassing	1
for	1
the	1
Russians,	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
adroit	1
diplomatists	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
(Joseph	1
de	1
Maistre	1
and	1
others)	1
recognized.	1
Still	1
more	1
senseless	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
wish	1
to	1
capture	1
army	1
corps	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
when	1
our	1
own	1
army	1
had	1
melted	1
away	1
to	1
half	1
before	1
reaching	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
a	1
whole	1
division	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
needed	1
to	1
convoy	1
the	1
corps	1
of	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
when	1
our	1
men	1
were	1
not	1
always	1
getting	1
full	1
rations	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
already	1
taken	1
were	1
perishing	1
of	1
hunger.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
profound	1
plans	1
about	1
cutting	1
off	1
and	1
capturing	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
a	1
market	1
gardener	1
who,	1
when	1
driving	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
garden	1
a	1
cow	1
that	1
had	1
trampled	1
down	1
the	1
beds	1
he	1
had	1
planted,	1
should	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
hit	1
the	1
cow	1
on	1
the	1
head.	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
excuse	1
of	1
that	1
gardener	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
angry.	1
But	1
not	1
even	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
drew	1
up	1
this	1
project,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
they	1
who	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
the	1
trampled	1
beds.	1
	1
But	1
besides	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
cutting	1
off	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
first	1
because--as	1
experience	1
shows	1
that	1
a	1
three-mile	1
movement	1
of	1
columns	1
on	1
a	1
battlefield	1
never	1
coincides	1
with	1
the	1
plans--the	1
probability	1
of	1
Chichagov,	1
Kutuzov,	1
and	1
Wittgenstein	1
effecting	1
a	1
junction	1
on	1
time	1
at	1
an	1
appointed	1
place	1
was	1
so	1
remote	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
tantamount	1
to	1
impossibility,	1
as	1
in	1
fact	1
thought	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
plan	1
remarked	1
that	1
diversions	1
planned	1
over	1
great	1
distances	1
do	1
not	1
yield	1
the	1
desired	1
results.	1
	1
Secondly	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
because	1
to	1
paralyze	1
the	1
momentum	1
with	1
which	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
was	1
retiring,	1
incomparably	1
greater	1
forces	1
than	1
the	1
Russians	1
possessed	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
required.	1
	1
Thirdly	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
because	1
the	1
military	1
term	1
"to	1
cut	1
off"	1
has	1
no	1
meaning.	1
One	1
can	1
cut	1
off	1
a	1
slice	1
of	1
bread,	1
but	1
not	1
an	1
army.	1
To	1
cut	1
off	1
an	1
army--to	1
bar	1
its	1
road--is	1
quite	1
impossible,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
plenty	1
of	1
room	1
to	1
avoid	1
capture	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
seen,	1
as	1
the	1
military	1
scientists	1
might	1
convince	1
themselves	1
by	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
possible	1
to	1
capture	1
prisoners	1
if	1
they	1
agree	1
to	1
be	1
captured,	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
possible	1
to	1
catch	1
a	1
swallow	1
if	1
it	1
settles	1
on	1
one's	1
hand.	1
Men	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
taken	1
prisoners	1
if	1
they	1
surrender	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
strategy	1
and	1
tactics,	1
as	1
the	1
Germans	1
did.	1
But	1
the	1
French	1
troops	1
quite	1
rightly	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
that	1
this	1
suited	1
them,	1
since	1
death	1
by	1
hunger	1
and	1
cold	1
awaited	1
them	1
in	1
flight	1
or	1
captivity	1
alike.	1
	1
Fourthly	1
and	1
chiefly	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
because	1
never	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
has	1
a	1
war	1
been	1
fought	1
under	1
such	1
conditions	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
obtained	1
in	1
1812,	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
in	1
its	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
strained	1
its	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
more	1
without	1
destroying	1
itself.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
from	1
Tarutino	1
to	1
Krasnoe	1
it	1
lost	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
sick	1
or	1
stragglers,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
number	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
population	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
provincial	1
town.	1
Half	1
the	1
men	1
fell	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
without	1
a	1
battle.	1
	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign--when	1
the	1
army	1
lacked	1
boots	1
and	1
sheepskin	1
coats,	1
was	1
short	1
of	1
provisions	1
and	1
without	1
vodka,	1
and	1
was	1
camping	1
out	1
at	1
night	1
for	1
months	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
with	1
fifteen	1
degrees	1
of	1
frost,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1
hours	1
of	1
daylight	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
was	1
night	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
discipline	1
cannot	1
be	1
maintained,	1
when	1
men	1
were	1
taken	1
into	1
that	1
region	1
of	1
death	1
where	1
discipline	1
fails,	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
only	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
battle,	1
but	1
for	1
months,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
every	1
moment	1
fighting	1
death	1
from	1
hunger	1
and	1
cold,	1
when	1
half	1
the	1
army	1
perished	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
month--it	1
is	1
of	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
that	1
the	1
historians	1
tell	1
us	1
how	1
Miloradovich	1
should	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
flank	1
march	1
to	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
place,	1
Tormasov	1
to	1
another	1
place,	1
and	1
Chichagov	1
should	1
have	1
crossed	1
(more	1
than	1
knee-deep	1
in	1
snow)	1
to	1
somewhere	1
else,	1
and	1
how	1
so-and-so	1
"routed"	1
and	1
"cut	1
off"	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
Russians,	1
half	1
of	1
whom	1
died,	1
did	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
to	1
attain	1
an	1
end	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
because	1
other	1
Russians,	1
sitting	1
in	1
warm	1
rooms,	1
proposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
impossible.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
strange	1
contradiction	1
now	1
difficult	1
to	1
understand	1
between	1
the	1
facts	1
and	1
the	1
historical	1
accounts	1
only	1
arises	1
because	1
the	1
historians	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
matter	1
have	1
written	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
words	1
and	1
sentiments	1
of	1
various	1
generals,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
events.	1
	1
To	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Miloradovich	1
seem	1
very	1
interesting,	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
their	1
surmises	1
and	1
the	1
rewards	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
general	1
received;	1
but	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
those	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
hospitals	1
and	1
in	1
graves	1
does	1
not	1
even	1
interest	1
them,	1
for	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
within	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
their	1
investigation.	1
	1
Yet	1
one	1
need	1
only	1
discard	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
reports	1
and	1
general	1
plans	1
and	1
consider	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
those	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
took	1
a	1
direct	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
events,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
seemed	1
insoluble	1
easily	1
and	1
simply	1
receive	1
an	1
immediate	1
and	1
certain	1
solution.	1
	1
The	1
aim	1
of	1
cutting	1
off	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
never	1
existed	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
imaginations	1
of	1
a	1
dozen	1
people.	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
exist	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
senseless	1
and	1
unattainable.	1
	1
The	1
people	1
had	1
a	1
single	1
aim:	1
to	1
free	1
their	1
land	1
from	1
invasion.	1
That	1
aim	1
was	1
attained	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
of	1
itself,	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
ran	1
away,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
necessary	1
not	1
to	1
stop	1
their	1
flight.	1
Secondly	1
it	1
was	1
attained	1
by	1
the	1
guerrilla	1
warfare	1
which	1
was	1
destroying	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
thirdly	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
a	1
large	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
following	1
the	1
French,	1
ready	1
to	1
use	1
its	1
strength	1
in	1
case	1
their	1
movement	1
stopped.	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
army	1
had	1
to	1
act	1
like	1
a	1
whip	1
to	1
a	1
running	1
animal.	1
And	1
the	1
experienced	1
driver	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
whip	1
raised	1
as	1
a	1
menace	1
than	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
running	1
animal	1
on	1
the	1
head.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
When	1
seeing	1
a	1
dying	1
animal	1
a	1
man	1
feels	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
horror:	1
substance	1
similar	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
is	1
perishing	1
before	1
his	1
eyes.	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
beloved	1
and	1
intimate	1
human	1
being	1
that	1
is	1
dying,	1
besides	1
this	1
horror	1
at	1
the	1
extinction	1
of	1
life	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
severance,	1
a	1
spiritual	1
wound,	1
which	1
like	1
a	1
physical	1
wound	1
is	1
sometimes	1
fatal	1
and	1
sometimes	1
heals,	1
but	1
always	1
aches	1
and	1
shrinks	1
at	1
any	1
external	1
irritating	1
touch.	1
	1
After	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
death	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
alike	1
felt	1
this.	1
Drooping	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
closing	1
their	1
eyes	1
before	1
the	1
menacing	1
cloud	1
of	1
death	1
that	1
overhung	1
them,	1
they	1
dared	1
not	1
look	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
They	1
carefully	1
guarded	1
their	1
open	1
wounds	1
from	1
any	1
rough	1
and	1
painful	1
contact.	1
Everything:	1
a	1
carriage	1
passing	1
rapidly	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
a	1
summons	1
to	1
dinner,	1
the	1
maid's	1
inquiry	1
what	1
dress	1
to	1
prepare,	1
or	1
worse	1
still	1
any	1
word	1
of	1
insincere	1
or	1
feeble	1
sympathy,	1
seemed	1
an	1
insult,	1
painfully	1
irritated	1
the	1
wound,	1
interrupting	1
that	1
necessary	1
quiet	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
both	1
tried	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
stern	1
and	1
dreadful	1
choir	1
that	1
still	1
resounded	1
in	1
their	1
imagination,	1
and	1
hindered	1
their	1
gazing	1
into	1
those	1
mysterious	1
limitless	1
vistas	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
had	1
opened	1
out	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
alone	1
together	1
were	1
they	1
free	1
from	1
such	1
outrage	1
and	1
pain.	1
They	1
spoke	1
little	1
even	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
did	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
very	1
unimportant	1
matters.	1
	1
Both	1
avoided	1
any	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
future.	1
To	1
admit	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1
future	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
insult	1
his	1
memory.	1
Still	1
more	1
carefully	1
did	1
they	1
avoid	1
anything	1
relating	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
was	1
dead.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
and	1
experienced	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
expressed	1
in	1
words,	1
and	1
that	1
any	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
infringed	1
the	1
majesty	1
and	1
sacredness	1
of	1
the	1
mystery	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
accomplished	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
Continued	1
abstention	1
from	1
speech,	1
and	1
constant	1
avoidance	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
might	1
lead	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
subject--this	1
halting	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
at	1
the	1
boundary	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
mention--brought	1
before	1
their	1
minds	1
with	1
still	1
greater	1
purity	1
and	1
clearness	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
feeling.	1
	1
But	1
pure	1
and	1
complete	1
sorrow	1
is	1
as	1
impossible	1
as	1
pure	1
and	1
complete	1
joy.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
as	1
absolute	1
and	1
independent	1
arbiter	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
fate	1
and	1
guardian	1
and	1
instructor	1
of	1
her	1
nephew,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
back	1
to	1
life	1
from	1
that	1
realm	1
of	1
sorrow	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
dwelt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
fortnight.	1
She	1
received	1
letters	1
from	1
her	1
relations	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
reply;	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
was	1
damp	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cough;	1
Alpatych	1
came	1
to	1
Yaroslavl	1
with	1
reports	1
on	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
their	1
affairs	1
and	1
with	1
advice	1
and	1
suggestions	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
return	1
to	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka	1
Street,	1
which	1
had	1
remained	1
uninjured	1
and	1
needed	1
only	1
slight	1
repairs.	1
Life	1
did	1
not	1
stand	1
still	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
live.	1
Hard	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
emerge	1
from	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
secluded	1
contemplation	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
till	1
then,	1
and	1
sorry	1
and	1
almost	1
ashamed	1
as	1
she	1
felt	1
to	1
leave	1
Natasha	1
alone,	1
yet	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
life	1
demanded	1
her	1
attention	1
and	1
she	1
involuntarily	1
yielded	1
to	1
them.	1
She	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
accounts	1
with	1
Alpatych,	1
conferred	1
with	1
Dessalles	1
about	1
her	1
nephew,	1
and	1
gave	1
orders	1
and	1
made	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
Natasha	1
remained	1
alone	1
and,	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
began	1
making	1
preparations	1
for	1
departure,	1
held	1
aloof	1
from	1
her	1
too.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
to	1
let	1
Natasha	1
go	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
both	1
parents	1
gladly	1
accepted	1
this	1
offer,	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
their	1
daughter	1
losing	1
strength	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
scene	1
and	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
Moscow	1
doctors	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
anywhere,"	1
Natasha	1
replied	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
her.	1
"Do	1
please	1
just	1
leave	1
me	1
alone!"	1
And	1
she	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
with	1
difficulty	1
refraining	1
from	1
tears	1
of	1
vexation	1
and	1
irritation	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
sorrow.	1
	1
After	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
deserted	1
by	1
Princes	1
Mary	1
and	1
alone	1
in	1
her	1
grief,	1
Natasha	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
by	1
herself,	1
sitting	1
huddled	1
up	1
feet	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
sofa,	1
tearing	1
and	1
twisting	1
something	1
with	1
her	1
slender	1
nervous	1
fingers	1
and	1
gazing	1
intently	1
and	1
fixedly	1
at	1
whatever	1
her	1
eyes	1
chanced	1
to	1
fall	1
on.	1
This	1
solitude	1
exhausted	1
and	1
tormented	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
absolute	1
need	1
of	1
it.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
anyone	1
entered	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
quickly,	1
changed	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
expression,	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
book	1
or	1
some	1
sewing,	1
evidently	1
waiting	1
impatiently	1
for	1
the	1
intruder	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
She	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
penetrate	1
that	1
on	1
which--with	1
a	1
terrible	1
questioning	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
her	1
strength--her	1
spiritual	1
gaze	1
was	1
fixed.	1
	1
One	1
day	1
toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
December	1
Natasha,	1
pale	1
and	1
thin,	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
woolen	1
gown,	1
her	1
plaited	1
hair	1
negligently	1
twisted	1
into	1
a	1
knot,	1
was	1
crouched	1
feet	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
her	1
sofa,	1
nervously	1
crumpling	1
and	1
smoothing	1
out	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
her	1
sash	1
while	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
gazing	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
gone--to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
life.	1
And	1
that	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
life,	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
thought	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
formerly	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
far	1
away	1
and	1
improbable,	1
was	1
now	1
nearer	1
and	1
more	1
akin	1
and	1
more	1
comprehensible	1
than	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
life,	1
where	1
everything	1
was	1
either	1
emptiness	1
and	1
desolation	1
or	1
suffering	1
and	1
indignity.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
gazing	1
where	1
she	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
him	1
otherwise	1
than	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
here.	1
She	1
now	1
saw	1
him	1
again	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Mytishchi,	1
at	1
Troitsa,	1
and	1
at	1
Yaroslavl.	1
	1
She	1
saw	1
his	1
face,	1
heard	1
his	1
voice,	1
repeated	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
devised	1
other	1
words	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
spoken.	1
	1
There	1
he	1
is	1
lying	1
back	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
in	1
his	1
velvet	1
cloak,	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
thin	1
pale	1
hand.	1
His	1
chest	1
is	1
dreadfully	1
hollow	1
and	1
his	1
shoulders	1
raised.	1
His	1
lips	1
are	1
firmly	1
closed,	1
his	1
eyes	1
glitter,	1
and	1
a	1
wrinkle	1
comes	1
and	1
goes	1
on	1
his	1
pale	1
forehead.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
twitches	1
just	1
perceptibly,	1
but	1
rapidly.	1
Natasha	1
knows	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
struggling	1
with	1
terrible	1
pain.	1
"What	1
is	1
that	1
pain	1
like?	1
Why	1
does	1
he	1
have	1
that	1
pain?	1
What	1
does	1
he	1
feel?	1
How	1
does	1
it	1
hurt	1
him?"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
He	1
noticed	1
her	1
watching	1
him,	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
seriously:	1
	1
"One	1
thing	1
would	1
be	1
terrible,"	1
said	1
he:	1
"to	1
bind	1
oneself	1
forever	1
to	1
a	1
suffering	1
man.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
continual	1
torture."	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
searchingly	1
at	1
her.	1
Natasha	1
as	1
usual	1
answered	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say.	1
She	1
said:	1
"This	1
can't	1
go	1
on--it	1
won't.	1
You	1
will	1
get	1
well--	1
quite	1
well."	1
	1
She	1
now	1
saw	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
that	1
scene	1
and	1
relived	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
then	1
felt.	1
She	1
recalled	1
his	1
long	1
sad	1
and	1
severe	1
look	1
at	1
those	1
words	1
and	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
rebuke	1
and	1
despair	1
in	1
that	1
protracted	1
gaze.	1
	1
"I	1
agreed,"	1
Natasha	1
now	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
"that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
dreadful	1
if	1
he	1
always	1
continued	1
to	1
suffer.	1
I	1
said	1
it	1
then	1
only	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
dreadful	1
for	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
understood	1
it	1
differently.	1
He	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
dreadful	1
for	1
me.	1
He	1
then	1
still	1
wished	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
feared	1
death.	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
it	1
so	1
awkwardly	1
and	1
stupidly!	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
meant.	1
I	1
thought	1
quite	1
differently.	1
Had	1
I	1
said	1
what	1
I	1
thought,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
said:	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
dying,	1
to	1
die	1
continually	1
before	1
my	1
eyes,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
happy	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
now.	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
nothing...	1
nobody.	1
Did	1
he	1
know	1
that?	1
No,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
and	1
never	1
will	1
know	1
it.	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
will	1
never,	1
never	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
right."	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
again	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
to	1
her,	1
only	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
Natasha	1
this	1
time	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
different	1
answer.	1
She	1
stopped	1
him	1
and	1
said:	1
"Terrible	1
for	1
you,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
me!	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
for	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
life	1
but	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
suffer	1
with	1
you	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
for	1
me,"	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
pressed	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
pressed	1
it	1
that	1
terrible	1
evening	1
four	1
days	1
before	1
his	1
death.	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
she	1
said	1
other	1
tender	1
and	1
loving	1
words	1
which	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
then	1
but	1
only	1
spoke	1
now:	1
"I	1
love	1
thee!...	1
thee!	1
I	1
love,	1
love..."	1
she	1
said,	1
convulsively	1
pressing	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
setting	1
her	1
teeth	1
with	1
a	1
desperate	1
effort...	1
	1
She	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
sweet	1
sorrow	1
and	1
tears	1
were	1
already	1
rising	1
in	1
her	1
eyes;	1
then	1
she	1
suddenly	1
asked	1
herself	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
this.	1
Again	1
everything	1
was	1
shrouded	1
in	1
hard,	1
dry	1
perplexity,	1
and	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
strained	1
frown	1
she	1
peered	1
toward	1
the	1
world	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
And	1
now,	1
now	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
penetrating	1
the	1
mystery....	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
incomprehensible	1
was	1
revealing	1
itself	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
loud	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
handle	1
struck	1
painfully	1
on	1
her	1
ears.	1
Dunyasha,	1
her	1
maid,	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
quickly	1
and	1
abruptly	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
showing	1
no	1
concern	1
for	1
her	1
mistress.	1
	1
"Come	1
to	1
your	1
Papa	1
at	1
once,	1
please!"	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
a	1
strange,	1
excited	1
look.	1
"A	1
misfortune...	1
about	1
Peter	1
Ilynich...	1
a	1
letter,"	1
she	1
finished	1
with	1
a	1
sob.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
Besides	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
aloofness	1
from	1
everybody	1
Natasha	1
was	1
feeling	1
a	1
special	1
estrangement	1
from	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
family.	1
All	1
of	1
them--	1
her	1
father,	1
mother,	1
and	1
Sonya--were	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
her,	1
so	1
familiar,	1
so	1
commonplace,	1
that	1
all	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
feelings	1
seemed	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
of	1
late,	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
not	1
merely	1
indifferent	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
regarded	1
them	1
with	1
hostility.	1
She	1
heard	1
Dunyasha's	1
words	1
about	1
Peter	1
Ilynich	1
and	1
a	1
misfortune,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
grasp	1
them.	1
	1
"What	1
misfortune?	1
What	1
misfortune	1
can	1
happen	1
to	1
them?	1
They	1
just	1
live	1
their	1
own	1
old,	1
quiet,	1
and	1
commonplace	1
life,"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
ballroom	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
hurriedly	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
room.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
puckered	1
up	1
and	1
wet	1
with	1
tears.	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
run	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
room	1
to	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
the	1
sobs	1
that	1
were	1
choking	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
Natasha	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arms	1
despairingly	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
convulsively	1
painful	1
sobs	1
that	1
distorted	1
his	1
soft	1
round	1
face.	1
	1
"Pe...	1
Petya...	1
Go,	1
go,	1
she...	1
is	1
calling..."	1
and	1
weeping	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
quickly	1
shuffling	1
on	1
his	1
feeble	1
legs	1
to	1
a	1
chair,	1
he	1
almost	1
fell	1
into	1
it,	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
an	1
electric	1
shock	1
seemed	1
to	1
run	1
through	1
Natasha's	1
whole	1
being.	1
Terrible	1
anguish	1
struck	1
her	1
heart,	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
dreadful	1
ache	1
as	1
if	1
something	1
was	1
being	1
torn	1
inside	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
were	1
dying.	1
But	1
the	1
pain	1
was	1
immediately	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
release	1
from	1
the	1
oppressive	1
constraint	1
that	1
had	1
prevented	1
her	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
life.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
the	1
terribly	1
wild	1
cries	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
that	1
she	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
door,	1
made	1
her	1
immediately	1
forget	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
grief.	1
	1
She	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
father,	1
but	1
he	1
feebly	1
waved	1
his	1
arm,	1
pointing	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
door.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
pale	1
and	1
with	1
quivering	1
chin,	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
that	1
room	1
and	1
taking	1
Natasha	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
her.	1
Natasha	1
neither	1
saw	1
nor	1
heard	1
her.	1
She	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps,	1
pausing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
if	1
struggling	1
with	1
herself,	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
awkward	1
position,	1
stretching	1
out	1
and	1
beating	1
her	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
maids	1
were	1
holding	1
her	1
arms.	1
	1
"Natasha!	1
Natasha!..."	1
cried	1
the	1
countess.	1
"It's	1
not	1
true...	1
it's	1
not	1
true...	1
He's	1
lying...	1
Natasha!"	1
she	1
shrieked,	1
pushing	1
those	1
around	1
her	1
away.	1
"Go	1
away,	1
all	1
of	1
you;	1
it's	1
not	1
true!	1
Killed!...	1
ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!...	1
It's	1
not	1
true!"	1
	1
Natasha	1
put	1
one	1
knee	1
on	1
the	1
armchair,	1
stooped	1
over	1
her	1
mother,	1
embraced	1
her,	1
and	1
with	1
unexpected	1
strength	1
raised	1
her,	1
turned	1
her	1
face	1
toward	1
herself,	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Mummy!...	1
darling!...	1
I	1
am	1
here,	1
my	1
dearest	1
Mummy,"	1
she	1
kept	1
on	1
whispering,	1
not	1
pausing	1
an	1
instant.	1
	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
but	1
struggled	1
tenderly	1
with	1
her,	1
demanded	1
a	1
pillow	1
and	1
hot	1
water,	1
and	1
unfastened	1
and	1
tore	1
open	1
her	1
mother's	1
dress.	1
	1
"My	1
dearest	1
darling...	1
Mummy,	1
my	1
precious!..."	1
she	1
whispered	1
incessantly,	1
kissing	1
her	1
head,	1
her	1
hands,	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
feeling	1
her	1
own	1
irrepressible	1
and	1
streaming	1
tears	1
tickling	1
her	1
nose	1
and	1
cheeks.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
pressed	1
her	1
daughter's	1
hand,	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
became	1
quiet	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
unaccustomed	1
swiftness,	1
glanced	1
vacantly	1
around	1
her,	1
and	1
seeing	1
Natasha	1
began	1
to	1
press	1
her	1
daughter's	1
head	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
strength.	1
Then	1
she	1
turned	1
toward	1
her	1
daughter's	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
wincing	1
with	1
pain	1
and	1
gazed	1
long	1
at	1
it.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
you	1
love	1
me?"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
trustful	1
whisper.	1
"Natasha,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
deceive	1
me?	1
You'll	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
whole	1
truth?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
look	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
love	1
and	1
an	1
entreaty	1
for	1
forgiveness.	1
	1
"My	1
darling	1
Mummy!"	1
she	1
repeated,	1
straining	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
taking	1
on	1
herself	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
grief	1
that	1
crushed	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
And	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
futile	1
struggle	1
with	1
reality	1
her	1
mother,	1
refusing	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
live	1
when	1
her	1
beloved	1
boy	1
was	1
killed	1
in	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
life,	1
escaped	1
from	1
reality	1
into	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
delirium.	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
how	1
that	1
day	1
passed	1
nor	1
that	1
night,	1
nor	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
mother.	1
Her	1
persevering	1
and	1
patient	1
love	1
seemed	1
completely	1
to	1
surround	1
the	1
countess	1
every	1
moment,	1
not	1
explaining	1
or	1
consoling,	1
but	1
recalling	1
her	1
to	1
life.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
third	1
night	1
the	1
countess	1
kept	1
very	1
quiet	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
rested	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
her	1
chair	1
and	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes,	1
but	1
opened	1
them	1
again	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
bedstead	1
creak.	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
and	1
speaking	1
softly.	1
	1
"How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
you	1
have	1
come.	1
You	1
are	1
tired.	1
Won't	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
tea?"	1
Natasha	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her.	1
"You	1
have	1
improved	1
in	1
looks	1
and	1
grown	1
more	1
manly,"	1
continued	1
the	1
countess,	1
taking	1
her	1
daughter's	1
hand.	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
saying..."	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
more,	1
no	1
more!"	1
	1
And	1
embracing	1
her	1
daughter,	1
the	1
countess	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
postponed	1
her	1
departure.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
tried	1
to	1
replace	1
Natasha	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
They	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
alone	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
mother	1
from	1
unreasoning	1
despair.	1
For	1
three	1
weeks	1
Natasha	1
remained	1
constantly	1
at	1
her	1
mother's	1
side,	1
sleeping	1
on	1
a	1
lounge	1
chair	1
in	1
her	1
room,	1
making	1
her	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
incessantly	1
because	1
the	1
mere	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
tender,	1
caressing	1
tones	1
soothed	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
The	1
mother's	1
wounded	1
spirit	1
could	1
not	1
heal.	1
Petya's	1
death	1
had	1
torn	1
from	1
her	1
half	1
her	1
life.	1
When	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
Petya's	1
death	1
had	1
come	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
fresh	1
and	1
vigorous	1
woman	1
of	1
fifty,	1
but	1
a	1
month	1
later	1
she	1
left	1
her	1
room	1
a	1
listless	1
old	1
woman	1
taking	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
life.	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
blow	1
that	1
almost	1
killed	1
the	1
countess,	1
this	1
second	1
blow,	1
restored	1
Natasha	1
to	1
life.	1
	1
A	1
spiritual	1
wound	1
produced	1
by	1
a	1
rending	1
of	1
the	1
spiritual	1
body	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
physical	1
wound	1
and,	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
deep	1
wound	1
may	1
heal	1
and	1
its	1
edges	1
join,	1
physical	1
and	1
spiritual	1
wounds	1
alike	1
can	1
yet	1
heal	1
completely	1
only	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
a	1
vital	1
force	1
from	1
within.	1
	1
Natasha's	1
wound	1
healed	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
She	1
thought	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
ended,	1
but	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
mother	1
unexpectedly	1
showed	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
life--love--was	1
still	1
active	1
within	1
her.	1
Love	1
awoke	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
life.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
last	1
days	1
had	1
bound	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
together;	1
this	1
new	1
sorrow	1
brought	1
them	1
still	1
closer	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
put	1
off	1
her	1
departure,	1
and	1
for	1
three	1
weeks	1
looked	1
after	1
Natasha	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
sick	1
child.	1
The	1
last	1
weeks	1
passed	1
in	1
her	1
mother's	1
bedroom	1
had	1
strained	1
Natasha's	1
physical	1
strength.	1
	1
One	1
afternoon	1
noticing	1
Natasha	1
shivering	1
with	1
fever,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
lie	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
bed.	1
Natasha	1
lay	1
down,	1
but	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
drawn	1
the	1
blinds	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
back.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
sleep,	1
Mary,	1
sit	1
by	1
me	1
a	1
little."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
tired--try	1
to	1
sleep."	1
	1
"No,	1
no.	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
bring	1
me	1
away?	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
asking	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
much	1
better.	1
She	1
spoke	1
so	1
well	1
today,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Natasha	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
semidarkness	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
scanned	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
face.	1
	1
"Is	1
she	1
like	1
him?"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
"Yes,	1
like	1
and	1
yet	1
not	1
like.	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
quite	1
original,	1
strange,	1
new,	1
and	1
unknown.	1
And	1
she	1
loves	1
me.	1
What	1
is	1
in	1
her	1
heart?	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
good.	1
But	1
how?	1
What	1
is	1
her	1
mind	1
like?	1
What	1
does	1
she	1
think	1
about	1
me?	1
Yes,	1
she	1
is	1
splendid!"	1
	1
"Mary,"	1
she	1
said	1
timidly,	1
drawing	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
hand	1
to	1
herself,	1
"Mary,	1
you	1
mustn't	1
think	1
me	1
wicked.	1
No?	1
Mary	1
darling,	1
how	1
I	1
love	1
you!	1
Let	1
us	1
be	1
quite,	1
quite	1
friends."	1
	1
And	1
Natasha,	1
embracing	1
her,	1
began	1
kissing	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
hands,	1
making	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
feel	1
shy	1
but	1
happy	1
by	1
this	1
demonstration	1
of	1
her	1
feelings.	1
	1
From	1
that	1
day	1
a	1
tender	1
and	1
passionate	1
friendship	1
such	1
as	1
exists	1
only	1
between	1
women	1
was	1
established	1
between	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha.	1
They	1
were	1
continually	1
kissing	1
and	1
saying	1
tender	1
things	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
their	1
time	1
together.	1
When	1
one	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
other	1
became	1
restless	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
rejoin	1
her.	1
Together	1
they	1
felt	1
more	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
felt	1
with	1
herself	1
when	1
alone.	1
A	1
feeling	1
stronger	1
than	1
friendship	1
sprang	1
up	1
between	1
them;	1
an	1
exclusive	1
feeling	1
of	1
life	1
being	1
possible	1
only	1
in	1
each	1
other's	1
presence.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
they	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
hours;	1
sometimes	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
bed	1
they	1
would	1
begin	1
talking	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
till	1
morning.	1
They	1
spoke	1
most	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
long	1
past.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
spoke	1
of	1
her	1
childhood,	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
her	1
daydreams;	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
with	1
a	1
passive	1
lack	1
of	1
understanding	1
had	1
formerly	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
that	1
life	1
of	1
devotion,	1
submission,	1
and	1
the	1
poetry	1
of	1
Christian	1
self-sacrifice,	1
now	1
feeling	1
herself	1
bound	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
by	1
affection,	1
learned	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
past	1
too	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
a	1
side	1
of	1
life	1
previously	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
applying	1
submission	1
and	1
self-abnegation	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
life,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
seek	1
other	1
joys,	1
but	1
she	1
understood	1
and	1
loved	1
in	1
another	1
those	1
previously	1
incomprehensible	1
virtues.	1
For	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
listening	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
tales	1
of	1
childhood	1
and	1
early	1
youth,	1
there	1
also	1
opened	1
out	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
hitherto	1
uncomprehended	1
side	1
of	1
life:	1
belief	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
its	1
enjoyment.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
before,	1
they	1
never	1
mentioned	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
lower	1
(as	1
they	1
thought)	1
their	1
exalted	1
feelings	1
by	1
words;	1
but	1
this	1
silence	1
about	1
him	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
making	1
them	1
gradually	1
begin	1
to	1
forget	1
him	1
without	1
being	1
conscious	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
Natasha	1
had	1
grown	1
thin	1
and	1
pale	1
and	1
physically	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
talked	1
about	1
her	1
health,	1
and	1
this	1
pleased	1
her.	1
But	1
sometimes	1
she	1
was	1
suddenly	1
overcome	1
by	1
fear	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
of	1
sickness,	1
weakness,	1
and	1
loss	1
of	1
good	1
looks,	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
she	1
examined	1
her	1
bare	1
arm	1
carefully,	1
surprised	1
at	1
its	1
thinness,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
noticed	1
her	1
drawn	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her,	1
piteous	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
glass.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
so,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
dreadfully	1
sad.	1
	1
One	1
day	1
she	1
went	1
quickly	1
upstairs	1
and	1
found	1
herself	1
out	1
of	1
breath.	1
Unconsciously	1
she	1
immediately	1
invented	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
going	1
down,	1
and	1
then,	1
testing	1
her	1
strength,	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
again,	1
observing	1
the	1
result.	1
	1
Another	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
called	1
Dunyasha	1
her	1
voice	1
trembled,	1
so	1
she	1
called	1
again--though	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
Dunyasha	1
coming--called	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
chest	1
tones	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
wont	1
to	1
sing,	1
and	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
herself.	1
	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
it,	1
but	1
beneath	1
the	1
layer	1
of	1
slime	1
that	1
covered	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
impenetrable,	1
delicate	1
young	1
shoots	1
of	1
grass	1
were	1
already	1
sprouting,	1
which	1
taking	1
root	1
would	1
so	1
cover	1
with	1
their	1
living	1
verdure	1
the	1
grief	1
that	1
weighed	1
her	1
down	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
soon	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
seen	1
or	1
noticed.	1
The	1
wound	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
heal	1
from	1
within.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
January	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
left	1
for	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
insisted	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
going	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
consult	1
the	1
doctors.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
After	1
the	1
encounter	1
at	1
Vyazma,	1
where	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
hold	1
back	1
his	1
troops	1
in	1
their	1
anxiety	1
to	1
overwhelm	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
the	1
farther	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
fleeing	1
French,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
who	1
pursued	1
them,	1
continued	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Krasnoe	1
without	1
a	1
battle.	1
The	1
flight	1
was	1
so	1
rapid	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
pursuing	1
the	1
French	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
them;	1
cavalry	1
and	1
artillery	1
horses	1
broke	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
information	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
never	1
reliable.	1
	1
The	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
were	1
so	1
worn	1
out	1
by	1
this	1
continuous	1
marching	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
twenty-seven	1
miles	1
a	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
any	1
faster.	1
	1
To	1
realize	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
exhaustion	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
to	1
grasp	1
clearly	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that,	1
while	1
not	1
losing	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
thousand	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded	1
after	1
Tarutino	1
and	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
prisoners,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
which	1
left	1
that	1
place	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
strong	1
reached	1
Krasnoe	1
with	1
only	1
fifty	1
thousand.	1
	1
The	1
rapidity	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
pursuit	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
destructive	1
to	1
our	1
army	1
as	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
to	1
theirs.	1
The	1
only	1
difference	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
moved	1
voluntarily,	1
with	1
no	1
such	1
threat	1
of	1
destruction	1
as	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sick	1
Frenchmen	1
were	1
left	1
behind	1
in	1
enemy	1
hands	1
while	1
the	1
sick	1
Russians	1
left	1
behind	1
were	1
among	1
their	1
own	1
people.	1
The	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
wastage	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
was	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
its	1
movement,	1
and	1
a	1
convincing	1
proof	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
corresponding	1
decrease	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
power,	1
instead	1
of	1
trying	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
as	1
was	1
desired	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
generals,	1
directed	1
his	1
whole	1
activity	1
here,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
Tarutino	1
and	1
Vyazma,	1
to	1
hastening	1
it	1
on	1
while	1
easing	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
our	1
army.	1
	1
But	1
besides	1
this,	1
since	1
the	1
exhaustion	1
and	1
enormous	1
diminution	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
the	1
advance	1
had	1
become	1
evident,	1
another	1
reason	1
for	1
slackening	1
the	1
pace	1
and	1
delaying	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
The	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
French.	1
The	1
road	1
the	1
French	1
would	1
take	1
was	1
unknown,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
closer	1
our	1
troops	1
trod	1
on	1
their	1
heels	1
the	1
greater	1
distance	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
cover.	1
Only	1
by	1
following	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
could	1
one	1
cut	1
across	1
the	1
zigzag	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
All	1
the	1
artful	1
maneuvers	1
suggested	1
by	1
our	1
generals	1
meant	1
fresh	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
a	1
lengthening	1
of	1
its	1
marches,	1
whereas	1
the	1
only	1
reasonable	1
aim	1
was	1
to	1
shorten	1
those	1
marches.	1
To	1
that	1
end	1
Kutuzov's	1
activity	1
was	1
directed	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Vilna--not	1
casually	1
or	1
intermittently	1
but	1
so	1
consistently	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
once	1
deviated	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
felt	1
and	1
knew--not	1
by	1
reasoning	1
or	1
science	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
Russian	1
being--what	1
every	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
felt:	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
beaten,	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
flying	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
driven	1
out;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
like	1
the	1
soldiers	1
realized	1
all	1
the	1
hardship	1
of	1
this	1
march,	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
unparalleled	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
generals,	1
especially	1
the	1
foreign	1
ones	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
distinguish	1
themselves,	1
to	1
astonish	1
somebody,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
king	1
or	1
a	1
duke--it	1
seemed	1
that	1
now--when	1
any	1
battle	1
must	1
be	1
horrible	1
and	1
senseless--was	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
to	1
fight	1
and	1
conquer	1
somebody.	1
Kutuzov	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
when	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
they	1
presented	1
projects	1
of	1
maneuvers	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
with	1
those	1
soldiers--	1
ill-shod,	1
insufficiently	1
clad,	1
and	1
half	1
starved--who	1
within	1
a	1
month	1
and	1
without	1
fighting	1
a	1
battle	1
had	1
dwindled	1
to	1
half	1
their	1
number,	1
and	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
best	1
if	1
the	1
flight	1
continued	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
greater	1
distance	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
already	1
traversed,	1
before	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
frontier.	1
	1
This	1
longing	1
to	1
distinguish	1
themselves,	1
to	1
maneuver,	1
to	1
overthrow,	1
and	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
showed	1
itself	1
particularly	1
whenever	1
the	1
Russians	1
stumbled	1
on	1
the	1
French	1
army.	1
	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
Krasnoe,	1
where	1
they	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
French	1
columns	1
and	1
stumbled	1
instead	1
on	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
with	1
sixteen	1
thousand	1
men.	1
Despite	1
all	1
Kutuzov's	1
efforts	1
to	1
avoid	1
that	1
ruinous	1
encounter	1
and	1
to	1
preserve	1
his	1
troops,	1
the	1
massacre	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
mob	1
of	1
French	1
soldiers	1
by	1
worn-out	1
Russians	1
continued	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
for	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
Toll	1
wrote	1
a	1
disposition:	1
"The	1
first	1
column	1
will	1
march	1
to	1
so	1
and	1
so,"	1
etc.	1
And	1
as	1
usual	1
nothing	1
happened	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
disposition.	1
Prince	1
Eugene	1
of	1
Wurttemberg	1
fired	1
from	1
a	1
hill	1
over	1
the	1
French	1
crowds	1
that	1
were	1
running	1
past,	1
and	1
demanded	1
reinforcements	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
arrive.	1
The	1
French,	1
avoiding	1
the	1
Russians,	1
dispersed	1
and	1
hid	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
by	1
night,	1
making	1
their	1
way	1
round	1
as	1
best	1
they	1
could,	1
and	1
continued	1
their	1
flight.	1
	1
Miloradovich,	1
who	1
said	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
commissariat	1
affairs	1
of	1
his	1
detachment,	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
found	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
wanted--that	1
chevalier	1
sans	1
peur	1
et	1
sans	1
reproche	1
*	1
as	1
he	1
styled	1
himself--who	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
parleys	1
with	1
the	1
French,	1
sent	1
envoys	1
demanding	1
their	1
surrender,	1
wasted	1
time,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Knight	1
without	1
fear	1
and	1
without	1
reproach.	1
	1
"I	1
give	1
you	1
that	1
column,	1
lads,"	1
he	1
said,	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
troops	1
and	1
pointing	1
out	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
the	1
cavalry.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
cavalry,	1
with	1
spurs	1
and	1
sabers	1
urging	1
on	1
horses	1
that	1
could	1
scarcely	1
move,	1
trotted	1
with	1
much	1
effort	1
to	1
the	1
column	1
presented	1
to	1
them-	1
-that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
to	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
Frenchmen	1
stark	1
with	1
cold,	1
frost-bitten,	1
and	1
starving--and	1
the	1
column	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
presented	1
to	1
them	1
threw	1
down	1
its	1
arms	1
and	1
surrendered	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
anxious	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
At	1
Krasnoe	1
they	1
took	1
twenty-six	1
thousand	1
prisoners,	1
several	1
hundred	1
cannon,	1
and	1
a	1
stick	1
called	1
a	1
"marshal's	1
staff,"	1
and	1
disputed	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
had	1
distinguished	1
himself	1
and	1
were	1
pleased	1
with	1
their	1
achievement--	1
though	1
they	1
much	1
regretted	1
not	1
having	1
taken	1
Napoleon,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
marshal	1
or	1
a	1
hero	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
and	1
reproached	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
especially	1
Kutuzov	1
for	1
having	1
failed	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
These	1
men,	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
their	1
passions,	1
were	1
but	1
blind	1
tools	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
melancholy	1
law	1
of	1
necessity,	1
but	1
considered	1
themselves	1
heroes	1
and	1
imagined	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
accomplishing	1
a	1
most	1
noble	1
and	1
honorable	1
deed.	1
They	1
blamed	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
he	1
had	1
prevented	1
their	1
vanquishing	1
Napoleon,	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
satisfying	1
his	1
passions	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
advance	1
from	1
the	1
Linen	1
Factories	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
comfortable	1
there,	1
that	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
he	1
checked	1
the	1
advance	1
because	1
on	1
learning	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
there	1
he	1
had	1
quite	1
lost	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
probable	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
understanding	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
bribed	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
his	1
contemporaries,	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
their	1
passions,	1
talk	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
but	1
posterity	1
and	1
history	1
have	1
acclaimed	1
Napoleon	1
as	1
grand,	1
while	1
Kutuzov	1
is	1
described	1
by	1
foreigners	1
as	1
a	1
crafty,	1
dissolute,	1
weak	1
old	1
courtier,	1
and	1
by	1
Russians	1
as	1
something	1
indefinite--a	1
sort	1
of	1
puppet	1
useful	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
Russian	1
name.	1

V	1
	1
In	1
1812	1
and	1
1813	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
openly	1
accused	1
of	1
blundering.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
in	1
a	1
history	1
recently	1
written	1
by	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Highest	1
Authorities	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
a	1
cunning	1
court	1
liar,	1
frightened	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
blunders	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
the	1
Berezina	1
he	1
deprived	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
complete	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
French.	1

History	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
1812.	1
The	1
character	1
of	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
reflections	1
on	1
the	1
unsatisfactory	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
battles	1
at	1
Krasnoe,	1
by	1
Bogdanovich.	1
	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
fate	1
not	1
of	1
great	1
men	1
(grands	1
hommes)	1
whom	1
the	1
Russian	1
mind	1
does	1
not	1
acknowledge,	1
but	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
and	1
always	1
solitary	1
individuals	1
who,	1
discerning	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
Providence,	1
submit	1
their	1
personal	1
will	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
hatred	1
and	1
contempt	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
punish	1
such	1
men	1
for	1
discerning	1
the	1
higher	1
laws.	1
	1
For	1
Russian	1
historians,	1
strange	1
and	1
terrible	1
to	1
say,	1
Napoleon--that	1
most	1
insignificant	1
tool	1
of	1
history	1
who	1
never	1
anywhere,	1
even	1
in	1
exile,	1
showed	1
human	1
dignity--Napoleon	1
is	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
adulation	1
and	1
enthusiasm;	1
he	1
is	1
grand.	1
But	1
Kutuzov--the	1
man	1
who	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
activity	1
in	1
1812,	1
never	1
once	1
swerving	1
by	1
word	1
or	1
deed	1
from	1
Borodino	1
to	1
Vilna,	1
presented	1
an	1
example	1
exceptional	1
in	1
history	1
of	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
a	1
present	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
importance	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening--	1
Kutuzov	1
seems	1
to	1
them	1
something	1
indefinite	1
and	1
pitiful,	1
and	1
when	1
speaking	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
1812	1
they	1
always	1
seem	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed.	1
	1
And	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
imagine	1
an	1
historical	1
character	1
whose	1
activity	1
was	1
so	1
unswervingly	1
directed	1
to	1
a	1
single	1
aim;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
aim	1
more	1
worthy	1
or	1
more	1
consonant	1
with	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
people.	1
Still	1
more	1
difficult	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
instance	1
in	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
an	1
historical	1
personage	1
being	1
so	1
completely	1
accomplished	1
as	1
that	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
Kutuzov's	1
efforts	1
were	1
directed	1
in	1
1812.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
never	1
talked	1
of	1
"forty	1
centuries	1
looking	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
Pyramids,"	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
he	1
offered	1
for	1
the	1
fatherland,	1
or	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
accomplish	1
or	1
had	1
accomplished;	1
in	1
general	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
about	1
himself,	1
adopted	1
no	1
pose,	1
always	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
ordinary	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
ordinary	1
things.	1
He	1
wrote	1
letters	1
to	1
his	1
daughters	1
and	1
to	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
read	1
novels,	1
liked	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
pretty	1
women,	1
jested	1
with	1
generals,	1
officers,	1
and	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
never	1
contradicted	1
those	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
prove	1
anything	1
to	1
him.	1
When	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
at	1
the	1
Yauza	1
bridge	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
personal	1
reproaches	1
for	1
having	1
caused	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
said:	1
"How	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
promised	1
not	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle?"	1
Kutuzov	1
replied:	1
"And	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
abandon	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle,"	1
though	1
Moscow	1
was	1
then	1
already	1
abandoned.	1
When	1
Arakcheev,	1
coming	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
said	1
that	1
Ermolov	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
artillery,	1
Kutuzov	1
replied:	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
saying	1
so	1
myself,"	1
though	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary.	1
What	1
did	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
him--who	1
then	1
alone	1
amid	1
a	1
senseless	1
crowd	1
understood	1
the	1
whole	1
tremendous	1
significance	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening--what	1
did	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
him	1
whether	1
Rostopchin	1
attributed	1
the	1
calamities	1
of	1
Moscow	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
to	1
himself?	1
Still	1
less	1
could	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
was	1
appointed	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
artillery.	1
	1
Not	1
merely	1
in	1
these	1
cases	1
but	1
continually	1
did	1
that	1
old	1
man--who	1
by	1
experience	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
thoughts	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
serving	1
as	1
their	1
expression	1
are	1
not	1
what	1
move	1
people--use	1
quite	1
meaningless	1
words	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
enter	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
But	1
that	1
man,	1
so	1
heedless	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
activity	1
utter	1
one	1
word	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
single	1
aim	1
toward	1
which	1
he	1
moved	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
war.	1
Obviously	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself,	1
in	1
very	1
diverse	1
circumstances,	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
expressed	1
his	1
real	1
thoughts	1
with	1
the	1
bitter	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
understood.	1
Beginning	1
with	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
from	1
which	1
time	1
his	1
disagreement	1
with	1
those	1
about	1
him	1
began,	1
he	1
alone	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
a	1
victory,	1
and	1
repeated	1
this	1
both	1
verbally	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
dispatches	1
and	1
reports	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
death.	1
He	1
alone	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Moscow	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Russia.	1
In	1
reply	1
to	1
Lauriston's	1
proposal	1
of	1
peace,	1
he	1
said:	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
peace,	1
for	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
people's	1
will.	1
He	1
alone	1
during	1
the	1
retreat	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
our	1
maneuvers	1
are	1
useless,	1
everything	1
is	1
being	1
accomplished	1
of	1
itself	1
better	1
than	1
we	1
could	1
desire;	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
must	1
be	1
offered	1
"a	1
golden	1
bridge";	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
Tarutino,	1
the	1
Vyazma,	1
nor	1
the	1
Krasnoe	1
battles	1
were	1
necessary;	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
keep	1
some	1
force	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
frontier	1
with,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
sacrifice	1
a	1
single	1
Russian	1
for	1
ten	1
Frenchmen.	1
	1
And	1
this	1
courtier,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
described	1
to	1
us,	1
who	1
lies	1
to	1
Arakcheev	1
to	1
please	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
he	1
alone--incurring	1
thereby	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
displeasure--said	1
in	1
Vilna	1
that	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
war	1
beyond	1
the	1
frontier	1
is	1
useless	1
and	1
harmful.	1
	1
Nor	1
do	1
words	1
alone	1
prove	1
that	1
only	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
events.	1
His	1
actions--without	1
the	1
smallest	1
deviation--were	1
all	1
directed	1
to	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
threefold	1
end:	1
(1)	1
to	1
brace	1
all	1
his	1
strength	1
for	1
conflict	1
with	1
the	1
French,	1
(2)	1
to	1
defeat	1
them,	1
and	1
(3)	1
to	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Russia,	1
minimizing	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
our	1
people	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
army.	1
	1
This	1
procrastinator	1
Kutuzov,	1
whose	1
motto	1
was	1
"Patience	1
and	1
Time,"	1
this	1
enemy	1
of	1
decisive	1
action,	1
gave	1
battle	1
at	1
Borodino,	1
investing	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
it	1
with	1
unparalleled	1
solemnity.	1
This	1
Kutuzov	1
who	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
began	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
lost,	1
he	1
alone,	1
in	1
contradiction	1
to	1
everyone	1
else,	1
declared	1
till	1
his	1
death	1
that	1
Borodino	1
was	1
a	1
victory,	1
despite	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
generals	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
lost	1
and	1
despite	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
retire	1
after	1
winning	1
a	1
battle	1
was	1
unprecedented.	1
He	1
alone	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
retreat	1
insisted	1
that	1
battles,	1
which	1
were	1
useless	1
then,	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
fought,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
new	1
war	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
begun	1
nor	1
the	1
frontiers	1
of	1
Russia	1
crossed.	1
	1
It	1
is	1
easy	1
now	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
these	1
events--if	1
only	1
we	1
abstain	1
from	1
attributing	1
to	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
aims	1
that	1
existed	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
a	1
dozen	1
individuals--for	1
the	1
events	1
and	1
results	1
now	1
lie	1
before	1
us.	1
	1
But	1
how	1
did	1
that	1
old	1
man,	1
alone,	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
opinion,	1
so	1
truly	1
discern	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
activity	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
once	1
untrue	1
to	1
it?	1
	1
The	1
source	1
of	1
that	1
extraordinary	1
power	1
of	1
penetrating	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
then	1
occuring	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
feeling	1
which	1
he	1
possessed	1
in	1
full	1
purity	1
and	1
strength.	1
	1
Only	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
possessed	1
this	1
feeling	1
caused	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
so	1
strange	1
a	1
manner,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
wish,	1
to	1
select	1
him--an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
disfavor--to	1
be	1
their	1
representative	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
war.	1
And	1
only	1
that	1
feeling	1
placed	1
him	1
on	1
that	1
highest	1
human	1
pedestal	1
from	1
which	1
he,	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
devoted	1
all	1
his	1
powers	1
not	1
to	1
slaying	1
and	1
destroying	1
men	1
but	1
to	1
saving	1
and	1
showing	1
pity	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
That	1
simple,	1
modest,	1
and	1
therefore	1
truly	1
great,	1
figure	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
cast	1
in	1
the	1
false	1
mold	1
of	1
a	1
European	1
hero--the	1
supposed	1
ruler	1
of	1
men--that	1
history	1
has	1
invented.	1
	1
To	1
a	1
lackey	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
great,	1
for	1
a	1
lackey	1
has	1
his	1
own	1
conception	1
of	1
greatness.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
The	1
fifth	1
of	1
November	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Krasnoe.	1
Toward	1
evening--after	1
much	1
disputing	1
and	1
many	1
mistakes	1
made	1
by	1
generals	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
their	1
proper	1
places,	1
and	1
after	1
adjutants	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
about	1
with	1
counterorders--when	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
everywhere	1
in	1
flight	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
battle,	1
Kutuzov	1
left	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Dobroe	1
whither	1
his	1
headquarters	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
been	1
transferred.	1
	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
frosty.	1
Kutuzov	1
rode	1
to	1
Dobroe	1
on	1
his	1
plump	1
little	1
white	1
horse,	1
followed	1
by	1
an	1
enormous	1
suite	1
of	1
discontented	1
generals	1
who	1
whispered	1
among	1
themselves	1
behind	1
his	1
back.	1
All	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
groups	1
of	1
French	1
prisoners	1
captured	1
that	1
day	1
(there	1
were	1
seven	1
thousand	1
of	1
them)	1
were	1
crowding	1
to	1
warm	1
themselves	1
at	1
campfires.	1
Near	1
Dobroe	1
an	1
immense	1
crowd	1
of	1
tattered	1
prisoners,	1
buzzing	1
with	1
talk	1
and	1
wrapped	1
and	1
bandaged	1
in	1
anything	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of,	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
beside	1
a	1
long	1
row	1
of	1
unharnessed	1
French	1
guns.	1
At	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
the	1
buzz	1
of	1
talk	1
ceased	1
and	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
Kutuzov	1
who,	1
wearing	1
a	1
white	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
band	1
and	1
a	1
padded	1
overcoat	1
that	1
bulged	1
on	1
his	1
round	1
shoulders,	1
moved	1
slowly	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
on	1
his	1
white	1
horse.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
was	1
reporting	1
to	1
him	1
where	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
prisoners	1
had	1
been	1
captured.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
seemed	1
preoccupied	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
general	1
was	1
saying.	1
He	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
dissatisfied	1
look	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
attentively	1
and	1
fixedly	1
at	1
these	1
prisoners,	1
who	1
presented	1
a	1
specially	1
wretched	1
appearance.	1
Most	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
disfigured	1
by	1
frost-bitten	1
noses	1
and	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
nearly	1
all	1
had	1
red,	1
swollen	1
and	1
festering	1
eyes.	1
	1
One	1
group	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
stood	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
them,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
had	1
his	1
face	1
covered	1
with	1
sores,	1
were	1
tearing	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
raw	1
flesh	1
with	1
their	1
hands.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
horrible	1
and	1
bestial	1
in	1
the	1
fleeting	1
glance	1
they	1
threw	1
at	1
the	1
riders	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
malevolent	1
expression	1
with	1
which,	1
after	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
Kutuzov,	1
the	1
soldier	1
with	1
the	1
sores	1
immediately	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
long	1
and	1
intently	1
at	1
these	1
two	1
soldiers.	1
He	1
puckered	1
his	1
face,	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
pensively	1
swayed	1
his	1
head.	1
At	1
another	1
spot	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
laughingly	1
patting	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
manner,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
again	1
swayed	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"What	1
were	1
you	1
saying?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
general,	1
who	1
continuing	1
his	1
report	1
directed	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
attention	1
to	1
some	1
standards	1
captured	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
standing	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
regiment.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
the	1
standards!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
evidently	1
detaching	1
himself	1
with	1
difficulty	1
from	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
preoccupied	1
him.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
absently.	1
Thousands	1
of	1
eyes	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
awaiting	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
He	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
regiment,	1
sighed	1
deeply,	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
suite	1
beckoned	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
carrying	1
the	1
standards	1
to	1
advance	1
and	1
surround	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
with	1
them.	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
and	1
then,	1
submitting	1
with	1
evident	1
reluctance	1
to	1
the	1
duty	1
imposed	1
by	1
his	1
position,	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
A	1
throng	1
of	1
officers	1
surrounded	1
him.	1
He	1
looked	1
attentively	1
around	1
at	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
officers,	1
recognizing	1
several	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
all!"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
the	1
officers.	1
In	1
the	1
stillness	1
around	1
him	1
his	1
slowly	1
uttered	1
words	1
were	1
distinctly	1
heard.	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
all	1
for	1
your	1
hard	1
and	1
faithful	1
service.	1
The	1
victory	1
is	1
complete	1
and	1
Russia	1
will	1
not	1
forget	1
you!	1
Honor	1
to	1
you	1
forever."	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
and	1
looked	1
around.	1
	1
"Lower	1
its	1
head,	1
lower	1
it!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
accidentally	1
lowered	1
the	1
French	1
eagle	1
he	1
was	1
holding	1
before	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
standards.	1
"Lower,	1
lower,	1
that's	1
it.	1
Hurrah	1
lads!"	1
he	1
added,	1
addressing	1
the	1
men	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
chin.	1
	1
"Hur-r-rah!"	1
roared	1
thousands	1
of	1
voices.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
soldiers	1
were	1
shouting	1
Kutuzov	1
leaned	1
forward	1
in	1
his	1
saddle	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
eye	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
mild	1
and	1
apparently	1
ironic	1
gleam.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
brothers..."	1
said	1
he	1
when	1
the	1
shouts	1
had	1
ceased...	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
changed.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
speaking	1
but	1
an	1
ordinary	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
comrades	1
something	1
very	1
important.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
among	1
the	1
throng	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
moved	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
hear	1
better	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
brothers,	1
I	1
know	1
it's	1
hard	1
for	1
you,	1
but	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!	1
Bear	1
up;	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
for	1
long	1
now!	1
We'll	1
see	1
our	1
visitors	1
off	1
and	1
then	1
we'll	1
rest.	1
The	1
Tsar	1
won't	1
forget	1
your	1
service.	1
It	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
you,	1
but	1
still	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
while	1
they--you	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
to,"	1
said	1
he,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners.	1
"Worse	1
off	1
than	1
our	1
poorest	1
beggars.	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
strong	1
we	1
didn't	1
spare	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
may	1
even	1
pity	1
them.	1
They	1
are	1
human	1
beings	1
too.	1
Isn't	1
it	1
so,	1
lads?"	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
around,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
direct,	1
respectful,	1
wondering	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
read	1
sympathy	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said.	1
His	1
face	1
grew	1
brighter	1
and	1
brighter	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
man's	1
mild	1
smile,	1
which	1
drew	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
eyes	1
into	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
wrinkles.	1
He	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
perplexity.	1
	1
"But	1
after	1
all	1
who	1
asked	1
them	1
here?	1
Serves	1
them	1
right,	1
the	1
bloody	1
bastards!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
suddenly	1
lifting	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
And	1
flourishing	1
his	1
whip	1
he	1
rode	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
broken	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
laughing	1
joyfully	1
and	1
shouting	1
"Hurrah!"	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
words	1
were	1
hardly	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
troops.	1
No	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
repeated	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
address,	1
begun	1
solemnly	1
and	1
then	1
changing	1
into	1
an	1
old	1
man's	1
simplehearted	1
talk;	1
but	1
the	1
hearty	1
sincerity	1
of	1
that	1
speech,	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
majestic	1
triumph	1
combined	1
with	1
pity	1
for	1
the	1
foe	1
and	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
our	1
cause,	1
exactly	1
expressed	1
by	1
that	1
old	1
man's	1
good-natured	1
expletives,	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
understood	1
but	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
every	1
soldier	1
and	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
their	1
joyous	1
and	1
long-	1
sustained	1
shouts.	1
Afterwards	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
addressed	1
Kutuzov	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
wished	1
his	1
caleche	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
for,	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
answering	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
When	1
the	1
troops	1
reached	1
their	1
night's	1
halting	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
of	1
November,	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Krasnoe	1
battles,	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
growing	1
dusk.	1
All	1
day	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
calm	1
and	1
frosty	1
with	1
occasional	1
lightly	1
falling	1
snow	1
and	1
toward	1
evening	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
clear.	1
Through	1
the	1
falling	1
snow	1
a	1
purple-black	1
and	1
starry	1
sky	1
showed	1
itself	1
and	1
the	1
frost	1
grew	1
keener.	1
	1
An	1
infantry	1
regiment	1
which	1
had	1
left	1
Tarutino	1
three	1
thousand	1
strong	1
but	1
now	1
numbered	1
only	1
nine	1
hundred	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
arrive	1
that	1
night	1
at	1
its	1
halting	1
place--a	1
village	1
on	1
the	1
highroad.	1
The	1
quartermasters	1
who	1
met	1
the	1
regiment	1
announced	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
huts	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
sick	1
and	1
dead	1
Frenchmen,	1
cavalrymen,	1
and	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
staff.	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
hut	1
available	1
for	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
hut.	1
The	1
regiment	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
stacked	1
its	1
arms	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
huts.	1
	1
Like	1
some	1
huge	1
many-limbed	1
animal,	1
the	1
regiment	1
began	1
to	1
prepare	1
its	1
lair	1
and	1
its	1
food.	1
One	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
dispersed	1
and	1
waded	1
knee-deep	1
through	1
the	1
snow	1
into	1
a	1
birch	1
forest	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
axes	1
and	1
swords,	1
the	1
crashing	1
of	1
branches,	1
and	1
merry	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
there.	1
Another	1
section	1
amid	1
the	1
regimental	1
wagons	1
and	1
horses	1
which	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
group	1
was	1
busy	1
getting	1
out	1
caldrons	1
and	1
rye	1
biscuit,	1
and	1
feeding	1
the	1
horses.	1
A	1
third	1
section	1
scattered	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
arranging	1
quarters	1
for	1
the	1
staff	1
officers,	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
French	1
corpses	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
huts,	1
and	1
dragging	1
away	1
boards,	1
dry	1
wood,	1
and	1
thatch	1
from	1
the	1
roofs,	1
for	1
the	1
campfires,	1
or	1
wattle	1
fences	1
to	1
serve	1
for	1
shelter.	1
	1
Some	1
fifteen	1
men	1
with	1
merry	1
shouts	1
were	1
shaking	1
down	1
the	1
high	1
wattle	1
wall	1
of	1
a	1
shed,	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
removed.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
all	1
together--shove!"	1
cried	1
the	1
voices,	1
and	1
the	1
huge	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
snow	1
and	1
creaking	1
with	1
frost,	1
was	1
seen	1
swaying	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
The	1
lower	1
stakes	1
cracked	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
wall	1
fell,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
pushing	1
it.	1
Loud,	1
coarse	1
laughter	1
and	1
joyous	1
shouts	1
ensued.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
catch	1
hold	1
in	1
twos!	1
Hand	1
up	1
the	1
lever!	1
That's	1
it...	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
shoving	1
to?"	1
	1
"Now,	1
all	1
together!	1
But	1
wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
boys...	1
With	1
a	1
song!"	1
	1
All	1
stood	1
silent,	1
and	1
a	1
soft,	1
pleasant	1
velvety	1
voice	1
began	1
to	1
sing.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
verse	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
note	1
died	1
away,	1
twenty	1
voices	1
roared	1
out	1
at	1
once:	1
"Oo-oo-oo-oo!	1
That's	1
it.	1
All	1
together!	1
Heave	1
away,	1
boys!..."	1
but	1
despite	1
their	1
united	1
efforts	1
the	1
wattle	1
hardly	1
moved,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
was	1
audible.	1
	1
"Here,	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Company!	1
Devils	1
that	1
you	1
are!	1
Lend	1
a	1
hand...	1
will	1
you?	1
You	1
may	1
want	1
us	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
days."	1
	1
Some	1
twenty	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Company	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
joined	1
the	1
haulers,	1
and	1
the	1
wattle	1
wall,	1
which	1
was	1
about	1
thirty-	1
five	1
feet	1
long	1
and	1
seven	1
feet	1
high,	1
moved	1
forward	1
along	1
the	1
village	1
street,	1
swaying,	1
pressing	1
upon	1
and	1
cutting	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
gasping	1
men.	1
	1
"Get	1
along...	1
Falling?	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
stopping	1
for?	1
There	1
now..."	1
	1
Merry	1
senseless	1
words	1
of	1
abuse	1
flowed	1
freely.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
up	1
to?"	1
suddenly	1
came	1
the	1
authoritative	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
sergeant	1
major	1
who	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
hauling	1
their	1
burden.	1
"There	1
are	1
gentry	1
here;	1
the	1
general	1
himself	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
hut,	1
and	1
you	1
foul-mouthed	1
devils,	1
you	1
brutes,	1
I'll	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you!"	1
shouted	1
he,	1
hitting	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
a	1
swinging	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
back.	1
"Can't	1
you	1
make	1
less	1
noise?"	1
	1
The	1
men	1
became	1
silent.	1
The	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
groaned	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
face,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
scratched	1
till	1
it	1
bled	1
by	1
his	1
falling	1
against	1
the	1
wattle.	1
	1
"There,	1
how	1
that	1
devil	1
hits	1
out!	1
He's	1
made	1
my	1
face	1
all	1
bloody,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
whisper	1
when	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major	1
had	1
passed	1
on.	1
	1
"Don't	1
you	1
like	1
it?"	1
said	1
a	1
laughing	1
voice,	1
and	1
moderating	1
their	1
tones	1
the	1
men	1
moved	1
forward.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
they	1
began	1
talking	1
again	1
as	1
loud	1
as	1
before,	1
interlarding	1
their	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
aimless	1
expletives.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
hut	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
passed,	1
the	1
chief	1
officers	1
had	1
gathered	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
animated	1
talk	1
over	1
their	1
tea	1
about	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
maneuvers	1
suggested	1
for	1
tomorrow.	1
It	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
flank	1
march	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
Vice-King	1
(Murat)	1
and	1
capture	1
him.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
soldiers	1
had	1
dragged	1
the	1
wattle	1
fence	1
to	1
its	1
place	1
the	1
campfires	1
were	1
blazing	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
ready	1
for	1
cooking,	1
the	1
wood	1
crackled,	1
the	1
snow	1
was	1
melting,	1
and	1
black	1
shadows	1
of	1
soldiers	1
flitted	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
occupied	1
space	1
where	1
the	1
snow	1
had	1
been	1
trodden	1
down.	1
	1
Axes	1
and	1
choppers	1
were	1
plied	1
all	1
around.	1
Everything	1
was	1
done	1
without	1
any	1
orders	1
being	1
given.	1
Stores	1
of	1
wood	1
were	1
brought	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
shelters	1
were	1
rigged	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
officers,	1
caldrons	1
were	1
being	1
boiled,	1
and	1
muskets	1
and	1
accouterments	1
put	1
in	1
order.	1
	1
The	1
wattle	1
wall	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
brought	1
was	1
set	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle	1
by	1
the	1
Eighth	1
Company	1
as	1
a	1
shelter	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
propped	1
up	1
by	1
musket	1
rests,	1
and	1
a	1
campfire	1
was	1
built	1
before	1
it.	1
They	1
beat	1
the	1
tattoo,	1
called	1
the	1
roll,	1
had	1
supper,	1
and	1
settled	1
down	1
round	1
the	1
fires	1
for	1
the	1
night--some	1
repairing	1
their	1
footgear,	1
some	1
smoking	1
pipes,	1
and	1
some	1
stripping	1
themselves	1
naked	1
to	1
steam	1
the	1
lice	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
shirts.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
almost	1
incredibly	1
wretched	1
conditions	1
the	1
Russian	1
soldiers	1
were	1
in	1
at	1
that	1
time--lacking	1
warm	1
boots	1
and	1
sheepskin	1
coats,	1
without	1
a	1
roof	1
over	1
their	1
heads,	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
with	1
eighteen	1
degrees	1
of	1
frost,	1
and	1
without	1
even	1
full	1
rations	1
(the	1
commissariat	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
troops)--they	1
would	1
have	1
presented	1
a	1
very	1
sad	1
and	1
depressing	1
spectacle.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
the	1
army	1
had	1
never	1
under	1
the	1
best	1
material	1
conditions	1
presented	1
a	1
more	1
cheerful	1
and	1
animated	1
aspect.	1
This	1
was	1
because	1
all	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
depressed	1
or	1
who	1
lost	1
strength	1
were	1
sifted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
day	1
by	1
day.	1
All	1
the	1
physically	1
or	1
morally	1
weak	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
been	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
army--physically	1
and	1
mentally--	1
remained.	1
	1
More	1
men	1
collected	1
behind	1
the	1
wattle	1
fence	1
of	1
the	1
Eighth	1
Company	1
than	1
anywhere	1
else.	1
Two	1
sergeants	1
major	1
were	1
sitting	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
campfire	1
blazed	1
brighter	1
than	1
others.	1
For	1
leave	1
to	1
sit	1
by	1
their	1
wattle	1
they	1
demanded	1
contributions	1
of	1
fuel.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
Makeev!	1
What	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
you,	1
you	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
bitch?	1
Are	1
you	1
lost	1
or	1
have	1
the	1
wolves	1
eaten	1
you?	1
Fetch	1
some	1
more	1
wood!"	1
shouted	1
a	1
red-haired	1
and	1
red-faced	1
man,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
blinking	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
but	1
not	1
moving	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
fire.	1
"And	1
you,	1
Jackdaw,	1
go	1
and	1
fetch	1
some	1
wood!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
another	1
soldier.	1
	1
This	1
red-haired	1
man	1
was	1
neither	1
a	1
sergeant	1
nor	1
a	1
corporal,	1
but	1
being	1
robust	1
he	1
ordered	1
about	1
those	1
weaker	1
than	1
himself.	1
The	1
soldier	1
they	1
called	1
"Jackdaw,"	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
fellow	1
with	1
a	1
sharp	1
nose,	1
rose	1
obediently	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
the	1
slender,	1
handsome	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
soldier	1
carrying	1
a	1
load	1
of	1
wood.	1
	1
"Bring	1
it	1
here--that's	1
fine!"	1
	1
They	1
split	1
up	1
the	1
wood,	1
pressed	1
it	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
fire,	1
blew	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
their	1
mouths,	1
and	1
fanned	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
their	1
greatcoats,	1
making	1
the	1
flames	1
hiss	1
and	1
crackle.	1
The	1
men	1
drew	1
nearer	1
and	1
lit	1
their	1
pipes.	1
The	1
handsome	1
young	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
wood,	1
setting	1
his	1
arms	1
akimbo,	1
began	1
stamping	1
his	1
cold	1
feet	1
rapidly	1
and	1
deftly	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
stood.	1
	1
"Mother!	1
The	1
dew	1
is	1
cold	1
but	1
clear....	1
It's	1
well	1
that	1
I'm	1
a	1
musketeer..."	1
he	1
sang,	1
pretending	1
to	1
hiccough	1
after	1
each	1
syllable.	1
	1
"Look	1
out,	1
your	1
soles	1
will	1
fly	1
off!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
red-haired	1
man,	1
noticing	1
that	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
the	1
dancer's	1
boot	1
was	1
hanging	1
loose.	1
"What	1
a	1
fellow	1
you	1
are	1
for	1
dancing!"	1
	1
The	1
dancer	1
stopped,	1
pulled	1
off	1
the	1
loose	1
piece	1
of	1
leather,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"Right	1
enough,	1
friend,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and,	1
having	1
sat	1
down,	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
knapsack	1
a	1
scrap	1
of	1
blue	1
French	1
cloth,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
it	1
round	1
his	1
foot.	1
"It's	1
the	1
steam	1
that	1
spoils	1
them,"	1
he	1
added,	1
stretching	1
out	1
his	1
feet	1
toward	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"They'll	1
soon	1
be	1
issuing	1
us	1
new	1
ones.	1
They	1
say	1
that	1
when	1
we've	1
finished	1
hammering	1
them,	1
we're	1
to	1
receive	1
double	1
kits!"	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
bitch	1
Petrov	1
has	1
lagged	1
behind	1
after	1
all,	1
it	1
seems,"	1
said	1
one	1
sergeant	1
major.	1
	1
"I've	1
had	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
him	1
this	1
long	1
while,"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"Well,	1
he's	1
a	1
poor	1
sort	1
of	1
soldier..."	1
	1
"But	1
in	1
the	1
Third	1
Company	1
they	1
say	1
nine	1
men	1
were	1
missing	1
yesterday."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
all	1
very	1
well,	1
but	1
when	1
a	1
man's	1
feet	1
are	1
frozen	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
walk?"	1
	1
"Eh?	1
Don't	1
talk	1
nonsense!"	1
said	1
a	1
sergeant	1
major.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
the	1
same?"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
soldier,	1
turning	1
reproachfully	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
frozen	1
feet.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
sharp-nosed	1
man	1
they	1
called	1
Jackdaw	1
in	1
a	1
squeaky	1
and	1
unsteady	1
voice,	1
raising	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
"a	1
plump	1
man	1
gets	1
thin,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
thin	1
one	1
it's	1
death.	1
Take	1
me,	1
now!	1
I've	1
got	1
no	1
strength	1
left,"	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
sudden	1
resolution	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major.	1
"Tell	1
them	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
to	1
hospital;	1
I'm	1
aching	1
all	1
over;	1
anyway	1
I	1
shan't	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
up."	1
	1
"That'll	1
do,	1
that'll	1
do!"	1
replied	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major	1
quietly.	1
	1
The	1
soldier	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
the	1
talk	1
went	1
on.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
those	1
Frenchies	1
were	1
taken	1
today,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
what	1
you	1
might	1
call	1
real	1
boots	1
on,"	1
said	1
a	1
soldier,	1
starting	1
a	1
new	1
theme.	1
"They	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
make-believes."	1
	1
"The	1
Cossacks	1
have	1
taken	1
their	1
boots.	1
They	1
were	1
clearing	1
the	1
hut	1
for	1
the	1
colonel	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
out.	1
It	1
was	1
pitiful	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
boys,"	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
dancer.	1
"As	1
they	1
turned	1
them	1
over	1
one	1
seemed	1
still	1
alive	1
and,	1
would	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
he	1
jabbered	1
something	1
in	1
their	1
lingo."	1
	1
"But	1
they're	1
a	1
clean	1
folk,	1
lads,"	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
went	1
on;	1
"he	1
was	1
white--	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
birchbark--and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
such	1
fine	1
fellows,	1
you	1
might	1
think	1
they	1
were	1
nobles."	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
They	1
make	1
soldiers	1
of	1
all	1
classes	1
there."	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
don't	1
understand	1
our	1
talk	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
the	1
dancer	1
with	1
a	1
puzzled	1
smile.	1
"I	1
asked	1
him	1
whose	1
subject	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
he	1
jabbered	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
A	1
queer	1
lot!"	1
	1
"But	1
it's	1
strange,	1
friends,"	1
continued	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
wondered	1
at	1
their	1
whiteness,	1
"the	1
peasants	1
at	1
Mozhaysk	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
began	1
burying	1
the	1
dead--where	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
you	1
know--well,	1
those	1
dead	1
had	1
been	1
lying	1
there	1
for	1
nearly	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
says	1
the	1
peasant,	1
'they	1
lie	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
paper,	1
clean,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
much	1
smell	1
as	1
a	1
puff	1
of	1
powder	1
smoke.'"	1
	1
"Was	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
cold?"	1
asked	1
someone.	1
	1
"You're	1
a	1
clever	1
fellow!	1
From	1
the	1
cold	1
indeed!	1
Why,	1
it	1
was	1
hot.	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
from	1
the	1
cold,	1
ours	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
rotted	1
either.	1
'But,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'go	1
up	1
to	1
ours	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
rotten	1
and	1
maggoty.	1
So,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'we	1
tie	1
our	1
faces	1
up	1
with	1
kerchiefs	1
and	1
turn	1
our	1
heads	1
away	1
as	1
we	1
drag	1
them	1
off:	1
we	1
can	1
hardly	1
do	1
it.	1
But	1
theirs,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'are	1
white	1
as	1
paper	1
and	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
smell	1
as	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
gunpowder.'"	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
from	1
their	1
food,"	1
said	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major.	1
"They	1
used	1
to	1
gobble	1
the	1
same	1
food	1
as	1
the	1
gentry."	1
	1
No	1
one	1
contradicted	1
him.	1
	1
"That	1
peasant	1
near	1
Mozhaysk	1
where	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
said	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
all	1
called	1
up	1
from	1
ten	1
villages	1
around	1
and	1
they	1
carted	1
for	1
twenty	1
days	1
and	1
still	1
didn't	1
finish	1
carting	1
the	1
dead	1
away.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
wolves,	1
he	1
says..."	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
battle,"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
soldier.	1
"It's	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
worth	1
remembering;	1
but	1
since	1
that...	1
it's	1
only	1
been	1
tormenting	1
folk."	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
Daddy,	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
we	1
ran	1
at	1
them	1
and,	1
my	1
word,	1
they	1
didn't	1
let	1
us	1
get	1
near	1
before	1
they	1
just	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
muskets	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
knees.	1
'Pardon!'	1
they	1
say.	1
That's	1
only	1
one	1
case.	1
They	1
say	1
Platov	1
took	1
'Poleon	1
himself	1
twice.	1
But	1
he	1
didn't	1
know	1
the	1
right	1
charm.	1
He	1
catches	1
him	1
and	1
catches	1
him--no	1
good!	1
He	1
turns	1
into	1
a	1
bird	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
flies	1
away.	1
And	1
there's	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
killing	1
him	1
either."	1
	1
"You're	1
a	1
first-class	1
liar,	1
Kiselev,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
you!"	1
	1
"Liar,	1
indeed!	1
It's	1
the	1
real	1
truth."	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
my	1
hands,	1
when	1
I'd	1
caught	1
him	1
I'd	1
bury	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
an	1
aspen	1
stake	1
to	1
fix	1
him	1
down.	1
What	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
men	1
he's	1
ruined!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
anyhow	1
we're	1
going	1
to	1
end	1
it.	1
He	1
won't	1
come	1
here	1
again,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
old	1
soldier,	1
yawning.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
flagged,	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
began	1
settling	1
down	1
to	1
sleep.	1
	1
"Look	1
at	1
the	1
stars.	1
It's	1
wonderful	1
how	1
they	1
shine!	1
You	1
would	1
think	1
the	1
women	1
had	1
spread	1
out	1
their	1
linen,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men,	1
gazing	1
with	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way.	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
harvest	1
next	1
year."	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
want	1
some	1
more	1
wood."	1
	1
"You	1
warm	1
your	1
back	1
and	1
your	1
belly	1
gets	1
frozen.	1
That's	1
queer."	1
	1
"O	1
Lord!"	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
pushing	1
for?	1
Is	1
the	1
fire	1
only	1
for	1
you?	1
Look	1
how	1
he's	1
sprawling!"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
ensued,	1
the	1
snoring	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Others	1
turned	1
over	1
and	1
warmed	1
themselves,	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
exchanging	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
From	1
a	1
campfire	1
a	1
hundred	1
paces	1
off	1
came	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
general,	1
merry	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Hark	1
at	1
them	1
roaring	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
Fifth	1
Company!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
"and	1
what	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
them	1
there	1
are!"	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Fifth	1
Company.	1
	1
"They're	1
having	1
such	1
fun,"	1
said	1
he,	1
coming	1
back.	1
"Two	1
Frenchies	1
have	1
turned	1
up.	1
One's	1
quite	1
frozen	1
and	1
the	1
other's	1
an	1
awful	1
swaggerer.	1
He's	1
singing	1
songs...."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I'll	1
go	1
across	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
look...."	1
	1
And	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Fifth	1
Company.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
The	1
fifth	1
company	1
was	1
bivouacking	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
A	1
huge	1
campfire	1
was	1
blazing	1
brightly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
snow,	1
lighting	1
up	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
trees	1
heavy	1
with	1
hoarfrost.	1
	1
About	1
midnight	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
the	1
crackling	1
of	1
dry	1
branches.	1
	1
"A	1
bear,	1
lads,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
raised	1
their	1
heads	1
to	1
listen,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
into	1
the	1
bright	1
firelight	1
stepped	1
two	1
strangely	1
clad	1
human	1
figures	1
clinging	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
These	1
were	1
two	1
Frenchmen	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
forest.	1
They	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
hoarsely	1
uttering	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
language	1
our	1
soldiers	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
One	1
was	1
taller	1
than	1
the	1
other;	1
he	1
wore	1
an	1
officer's	1
hat	1
and	1
seemed	1
quite	1
exhausted.	1
On	1
approaching	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
to	1
sit	1
down,	1
but	1
fell.	1
The	1
other,	1
a	1
short	1
sturdy	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
shawl	1
tied	1
round	1
his	1
head,	1
was	1
stronger.	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
companion	1
and	1
said	1
something,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
mouth.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
surrounded	1
the	1
Frenchmen,	1
spread	1
a	1
greatcoat	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
the	1
sick	1
man,	1
and	1
brought	1
some	1
buckwheat	1
porridge	1
and	1
vodka	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
exhausted	1
French	1
officer	1
was	1
Ramballe	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
wrapped	1
in	1
the	1
shawl	1
was	1
Morel,	1
his	1
orderly.	1
	1
When	1
Morel	1
had	1
drunk	1
some	1
vodka	1
and	1
finished	1
his	1
bowl	1
of	1
porridge	1
he	1
suddenly	1
became	1
unnaturally	1
merry	1
and	1
chattered	1
incessantly	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
him.	1
Ramballe	1
refused	1
food	1
and	1
resting	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
lay	1
silent	1
beside	1
the	1
campfire,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Russian	1
soldiers	1
with	1
red	1
and	1
vacant	1
eyes.	1
Occasionally	1
he	1
emitted	1
a	1
long-drawn	1
groan	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
became	1
silent.	1
Morel,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
tried	1
to	1
impress	1
on	1
the	1
soldiers	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Ramballe	1
was	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
warmed.	1
A	1
Russian	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
sent	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
colonel	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
French	1
officer	1
into	1
his	1
hut	1
to	1
warm	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
messenger	1
returned	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
colonel	1
wished	1
the	1
officer	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
him,	1
Ramballe	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
go.	1
He	1
rose	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
walk,	1
but	1
staggered	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
soldier	1
standing	1
by	1
held	1
him	1
up.	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
do	1
it	1
again,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
winking	1
and	1
turning	1
mockingly	1
to	1
Ramballe.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
fool!	1
Why	1
talk	1
rubbish,	1
lout	1
that	1
you	1
are--a	1
real	1
peasant!"	1
came	1
rebukes	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
jesting	1
soldier.	1
	1
They	1
surrounded	1
Ramballe,	1
lifted	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
crossed	1
arms	1
of	1
two	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
hut.	1
Ramballe	1
put	1
his	1
arms	1
around	1
their	1
necks	1
while	1
they	1
carried	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
wailing	1
plaintively:	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
fine	1
fellows,	1
my	1
kind,	1
kind	1
friends!	1
These	1
are	1
men!	1
Oh,	1
my	1
brave,	1
kind	1
friends,"	1
and	1
he	1
leaned	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
shoulder	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
like	1
a	1
child.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Morel	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
place	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
	1
Morel,	1
a	1
short	1
sturdy	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
inflamed	1
and	1
streaming	1
eyes,	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
woman's	1
cloak	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
shawl	1
tied	1
woman	1
fashion	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
over	1
his	1
cap.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
tipsy,	1
and	1
was	1
singing	1
a	1
French	1
song	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
broken	1
voice,	1
with	1
an	1
arm	1
thrown	1
round	1
the	1
nearest	1
soldier.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
simply	1
held	1
their	1
sides	1
as	1
they	1
watched	1
him.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
now	1
then,	1
teach	1
us	1
how	1
it	1
goes!	1
I'll	1
soon	1
pick	1
it	1
up.	1
How	1
is	1
it?"	1
said	1
the	1
man--a	1
singer	1
and	1
a	1
wag--whom	1
Morel	1
was	1
embracing.	1
	1
"Vive	1
Henri	1
Quatre!	1
Vive	1
ce	1
roi	1
valiant!"	1
sang	1
Morel,	1
winking.	1
"Ce	1
diable	1
a	1
quatre..."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Long	1
live	1
Henry	1
the	1
Fourth,	1
that	1
valiant	1
king!	1
That	1
rowdy	1
devil."	1
	1
"Vivarika!	1
Vif-seruvaru!	1
Sedyablyaka!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
soldier,	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
really	1
catching	1
the	1
tune.	1
	1
"Bravo!	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!"	1
rose	1
their	1
rough,	1
joyous	1
laughter	1
from	1
all	1
sides.	1
	1
Morel,	1
wrinkling	1
up	1
his	1
face,	1
laughed	1
too.	1
	1
"Well,	1
go	1
on,	1
go	1
on!"	1
	1
	1
"Qui	1
eut	1
le	1
triple	1
talent,	1
De	1
boire,	1
de	1
battre,	1
Et	1
d'etre	1
un	1
vert	1
galant."	1

Who	1
had	1
a	1
triple	1
talent	1
For	1
drinking,	1
for	1
fighting,	1
And	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
gallant	1
old	1
boy...	1
	1
"It	1
goes	1
smoothly,	1
too.	1
Well,	1
now,	1
Zaletaev!"	1
	1
"Ke..."	1
Zaletaev,	1
brought	1
out	1
with	1
effort:	1
"ke-e-e-e,"	1
he	1
drawled,	1
laboriously	1
pursing	1
his	1
lips,	1
"le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba,	1
e	1
de-tra-va-	1
ga-la"	1
he	1
sang.	1
	1
"Fine!	1
Just	1
like	1
the	1
Frenchie!	1
Oh,	1
ho	1
ho!	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
some	1
more	1
to	1
eat?"	1
	1
"Give	1
him	1
some	1
porridge:	1
it	1
takes	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
filled	1
up	1
after	1
starving."	1
	1
They	1
gave	1
him	1
some	1
more	1
porridge	1
and	1
Morel	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
third	1
bowl.	1
All	1
the	1
young	1
soldiers	1
smiled	1
gaily	1
as	1
they	1
watched	1
him.	1
The	1
older	1
men,	1
who	1
thought	1
it	1
undignified	1
to	1
amuse	1
themselves	1
with	1
such	1
nonsense,	1
continued	1
to	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
but	1
one	1
would	1
occasionally	1
raise	1
himself	1
on	1
an	1
elbow	1
and	1
glance	1
at	1
Morel	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
men	1
too,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
wrapped	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
coat.	1
"Even	1
wormwood	1
grows	1
on	1
its	1
own	1
root."	1
	1
"O	1
Lord,	1
O	1
Lord!	1
How	1
starry	1
it	1
is!	1
Tremendous!	1
That	1
means	1
a	1
hard	1
frost...."	1
	1
They	1
all	1
grew	1
silent.	1
The	1
stars,	1
as	1
if	1
knowing	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
them,	1
began	1
to	1
disport	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
sky:	1
now	1
flaring	1
up,	1
now	1
vanishing,	1
now	1
trembling,	1
they	1
were	1
busy	1
whispering	1
something	1
gladsome	1
and	1
mysterious	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
The	1
French	1
army	1
melted	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
uniform	1
rate	1
of	1
a	1
mathematical	1
progression;	1
and	1
that	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina	1
about	1
which	1
so	1
much	1
has	1
been	1
written	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
intermediate	1
stage	1
in	1
its	1
destruction,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
decisive	1
episode	1
of	1
the	1
campaign.	1
If	1
so	1
much	1
has	1
been	1
and	1
still	1
is	1
written	1
about	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
on	1
the	1
French	1
side	1
this	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
at	1
the	1
broken	1
bridge	1
across	1
that	1
river	1
the	1
calamities	1
their	1
army	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
enduring	1
were	1
suddenly	1
concentrated	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
into	1
a	1
tragic	1
spectacle	1
that	1
remained	1
in	1
every	1
memory,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
side	1
merely	1
because	1
in	1
Petersburg--far	1
from	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
war--a	1
plan	1
(again	1
one	1
of	1
Pfuel's)	1
had	1
been	1
devised	1
to	1
catch	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
a	1
strategic	1
trap	1
at	1
the	1
Berezina	1
River.	1
Everyone	1
assured	1
himself	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
happen	1
according	1
to	1
plan,	1
and	1
therefore	1
insisted	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina	1
that	1
destroyed	1
the	1
French	1
army.	1
In	1
reality	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
crossing	1
were	1
much	1
less	1
disastrous	1
to	1
the	1
French--in	1
guns	1
and	1
men	1
lost--than	1
Krasnoe	1
had	1
been,	1
as	1
the	1
figures	1
show.	1
	1
The	1
sole	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
plainly	1
and	1
indubitably	1
proved	1
the	1
fallacy	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
plans	1
for	1
cutting	1
off	1
the	1
enemy's	1
retreat	1
and	1
the	1
soundness	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
possible	1
line	1
of	1
action--the	1
one	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
demanded--namely,	1
simply	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
enemy	1
up.	1
The	1
French	1
crowd	1
fled	1
at	1
a	1
continually	1
increasing	1
speed	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
energy	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
reaching	1
its	1
goal.	1
It	1
fled	1
like	1
a	1
wounded	1
animal	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
block	1
its	1
path.	1
This	1
was	1
shown	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
arrangements	1
it	1
made	1
for	1
crossing	1
as	1
by	1
what	1
took	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
bridges.	1
When	1
the	1
bridges	1
broke	1
down,	1
unarmed	1
soldiers,	1
people	1
from	1
Moscow	1
and	1
women	1
with	1
children	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
transport,	1
all--carried	1
on	1
by	1
vis	1
inertiae--	1
pressed	1
forward	1
into	1
boats	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
ice-covered	1
water	1
and	1
did	1
not,	1
surrender.	1
	1
That	1
impulse	1
was	1
reasonable.	1
The	1
condition	1
of	1
fugitives	1
and	1
of	1
pursuers	1
was	1
equally	1
bad.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
remained	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
people	1
each	1
might	1
hope	1
for	1
help	1
from	1
his	1
fellows	1
and	1
the	1
definite	1
place	1
he	1
held	1
among	1
them.	1
But	1
those	1
who	1
surrendered,	1
while	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
pitiful	1
plight,	1
would	1
be	1
on	1
a	1
lower	1
level	1
to	1
claim	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
necessities	1
of	1
life.	1
The	1
French	1
did	1
not	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
informed	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
half	1
the	1
prisoners--with	1
whom	1
the	1
Russians	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do-	1
-perished	1
of	1
cold	1
and	1
hunger	1
despite	1
their	1
captors'	1
desire	1
to	1
save	1
them;	1
they	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise.	1
The	1
most	1
compassionate	1
Russian	1
commanders,	1
those	1
favorable	1
to	1
the	1
French--and	1
even	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
service--could	1
do	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
prisoners.	1
The	1
French	1
perished	1
from	1
the	1
conditions	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
itself	1
exposed.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
take	1
bread	1
and	1
clothes	1
from	1
our	1
hungry	1
and	1
indispensable	1
soldiers	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
who,	1
though	1
not	1
harmful,	1
or	1
hated,	1
or	1
guilty,	1
were	1
simply	1
unnecessary.	1
Some	1
Russians	1
even	1
did	1
that,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
exceptions.	1
	1
Certain	1
destruction	1
lay	1
behind	1
the	1
French	1
but	1
in	1
front	1
there	1
was	1
hope.	1
Their	1
ships	1
had	1
been	1
burned,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
salvation	1
save	1
in	1
collective	1
flight,	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
concentrated.	1
	1
The	1
farther	1
they	1
fled	1
the	1
more	1
wretched	1
became	1
the	1
plight	1
of	1
the	1
remnant,	1
especially	1
after	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
on	1
which	1
(in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
plan)	1
special	1
hopes	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
by	1
the	1
Russians,	1
and	1
the	1
keener	1
grew	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders,	1
who	1
blamed	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
most	1
of	1
all.	1
Anticipation	1
that	1
the	1
failure	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
Berezina	1
plan	1
would	1
be	1
attributed	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
led	1
to	1
dissatisfaction,	1
contempt,	1
and	1
ridicule,	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
strongly	1
expressed.	1
The	1
ridicule	1
and	1
contempt	1
were	1
of	1
course	1
expressed	1
in	1
a	1
respectful	1
form,	1
making	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
wherein	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
seriously	1
to	1
him;	1
when	1
reporting	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
asking	1
for	1
his	1
sanction	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilling	1
a	1
regrettable	1
formality,	1
but	1
they	1
winked	1
behind	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
mislead	1
him	1
at	1
every	1
turn.	1
	1
Because	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
assumed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man;	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
grasp	1
the	1
profundity	1
of	1
their	1
plans,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
answer	1
with	1
his	1
phrases	1
(which	1
they	1
thought	1
were	1
mere	1
phrases)	1
about	1
a	1
"golden	1
bridge,"	1
about	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
crossing	1
the	1
frontier	1
with	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
tatterdemalions,	1
and	1
so	1
forth.	1
They	1
had	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
before.	1
And	1
all	1
he	1
said--that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
await	1
provisions,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
no	1
boots--was	1
so	1
simple,	1
while	1
what	1
they	1
proposed	1
was	1
so	1
complicated	1
and	1
clever,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
stupid	1
and	1
that	1
they,	1
though	1
not	1
in	1
power,	1
were	1
commanders	1
of	1
genius.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
junction	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
brilliant	1
admiral	1
and	1
Petersburg	1
hero	1
Wittgenstein,	1
this	1
mood	1
and	1
the	1
gossip	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
reached	1
their	1
maximum.	1
Kutuzov	1
saw	1
this	1
and	1
merely	1
sighed	1
and	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Only	1
once,	1
after	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
did	1
he	1
get	1
angry	1
and	1
write	1
to	1
Bennigsen	1
(who	1
reported	1
separately	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor)	1
the	1
following	1
letter:	1
	1
"On	1
account	1
of	1
your	1
spells	1
of	1
ill	1
health,	1
will	1
your	1
excellency	1
please	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
Kaluga	1
on	1
receipt	1
of	1
this,	1
and	1
there	1
await	1
further	1
commands	1
and	1
appointments	1
from	1
His	1
Imperial	1
Majesty."	1
	1
But	1
after	1
Bennigsen's	1
departure,	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
Tsarevich	1
Constantine	1
Pavlovich	1
joined	1
the	1
army.	1
He	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
but	1
had	1
subsequently	1
been	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
by	1
Kutuzov.	1
Now	1
having	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
he	1
informed	1
Kutuzov	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
displeasure	1
at	1
the	1
poor	1
success	1
of	1
our	1
forces	1
and	1
the	1
slowness	1
of	1
their	1
advance.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
intended	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army	1
personally	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days'	1
time.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man,	1
experienced	1
in	1
court	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
military	1
affairs--this	1
same	1
Kutuzov	1
who	1
in	1
August	1
had	1
been	1
chosen	1
commander-in-chief	1
against	1
the	1
sovereign's	1
wishes	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
removed	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
and	1
heir--	1
apparent	1
from	1
the	1
army--who	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
authority	1
and	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
will	1
had	1
decided	1
on	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
now	1
realized	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
his	1
day	1
was	1
over,	1
that	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
played,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
he	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
hold	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
his.	1
And	1
he	1
understood	1
this	1
not	1
merely	1
from	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
court.	1
He	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
that	1
the	1
military	1
business	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
played	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
ended	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
mission	1
was	1
accomplished;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
physical	1
weariness	1
of	1
his	1
aged	1
body	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
physical	1
rest.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-ninth	1
of	1
November	1
Kutuzov	1
entered	1
Vilna--his	1
"dear	1
Vilna"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it.	1
Twice	1
during	1
his	1
career	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
been	1
governor	1
of	1
Vilna.	1
In	1
that	1
wealthy	1
town,	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
injured,	1
he	1
found	1
old	1
friends	1
and	1
associations,	1
besides	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
deprived.	1
And	1
he	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
army	1
and	1
state	1
and,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
passions	1
that	1
seethed	1
around	1
him	1
allowed,	1
immersed	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
quiet	1
life	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
accustomed,	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
history	1
did	1
not	1
concern	1
him	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
Chichagov,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
zealous	1
"cutters-off"	1
and	1
"breakers-up,"	1
who	1
had	1
first	1
wanted	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
diversion	1
in	1
Greece	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
Warsaw	1
but	1
never	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
sent:	1
Chichagov,	1
noted	1
for	1
the	1
boldness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
who	1
considered	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
an	1
obligation	1
to	1
him	1
because	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
make	1
peace	1
with	1
Turkey	1
in	1
1811	1
independently	1
of	1
Kutuzov,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
peace	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
concluded,	1
he	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
that	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
securing	1
that	1
peace	1
was	1
really	1
Kutuzov's;	1
this	1
Chichagov	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
meet	1
Kutuzov	1
at	1
the	1
castle	1
where	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
to	1
stay.	1
In	1
undress	1
naval	1
uniform,	1
with	1
a	1
dirk,	1
and	1
holding	1
his	1
cap	1
under	1
his	1
arm,	1
he	1
handed	1
Kutuzov	1
a	1
garrison	1
report	1
and	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
The	1
contemptuously	1
respectful	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
dotage	1
was	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
by	1
the	1
behavior	1
of	1
Chichagov,	1
who	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
accusations	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
directed	1
against	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
When	1
speaking	1
to	1
Chichagov,	1
Kutuzov	1
incidentally	1
mentioned	1
that	1
the	1
vehicles	1
packed	1
with	1
china	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
from	1
him	1
at	1
Borisov	1
had	1
been	1
recovered	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
mean	1
to	1
imply	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat	1
out	1
of....	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
can	1
supply	1
you	1
with	1
everything	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
give	1
dinner	1
parties,"	1
warmly	1
replied	1
Chichagov,	1
who	1
tried	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
prove	1
his	1
own	1
rectitude	1
and	1
therefore	1
imagined	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
be	1
animated	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
desire.	1
	1
Kutuzov,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
replied	1
with	1
his	1
subtle	1
penetrating	1
smile:	1
"I	1
meant	1
merely	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
said."	1
	1
Contrary	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
wish	1
Kutuzov	1
detained	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
at	1
Vilna.	1
Those	1
about	1
him	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
extraordinarily	1
slack	1
and	1
physically	1
feeble	1
during	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
that	1
town.	1
He	1
attended	1
to	1
army	1
affairs	1
reluctantly,	1
left	1
everything	1
to	1
his	1
generals,	1
and	1
while	1
awaiting	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
arrival	1
led	1
a	1
dissipated	1
life.	1
	1
Having	1
left	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
of	1
December	1
with	1
his	1
suite--Count	1
Tolstoy,	1
Prince	1
Volkonski,	1
Arakcheev,	1
and	1
others--the	1
Emperor	1
reached	1
Vilna	1
on	1
the	1
eleventh,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
traveling	1
sleigh	1
drove	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
castle.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
severe	1
frost	1
some	1
hundred	1
generals	1
and	1
staff	1
officers	1
in	1
full	1
parade	1
uniform	1
stood	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
guard	1
of	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment.	1
	1
A	1
courier	1
who	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
castle	1
in	1
advance,	1
in	1
a	1
troyka	1
with	1
three	1
foam-flecked	1
horses,	1
shouted	1
"Coming!"	1
and	1
Konovnitsyn	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
vestibule	1
to	1
inform	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
porter's	1
little	1
lodge.	1
	1
A	1
minute	1
later	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
large	1
stout	1
figure	1
in	1
full-dress	1
uniform,	1
his	1
chest	1
covered	1
with	1
orders	1
and	1
a	1
scarf	1
drawn	1
round	1
his	1
stomach,	1
waddled	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch.	1
He	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
hat	1
with	1
its	1
peaks	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
and,	1
holding	1
his	1
gloves	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
walking	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
sideways	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
took	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
report	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
running	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
and	1
whispering;	1
another	1
troyka	1
flew	1
furiously	1
up,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
turned	1
on	1
an	1
approaching	1
sleigh	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
Volkonski	1
could	1
already	1
be	1
descried.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
fifty	1
years	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
a	1
physically	1
agitating	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
general.	1
He	1
carefully	1
and	1
hastily	1
felt	1
himself	1
all	1
over,	1
readjusted	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
pulling	1
himself	1
together	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
having	1
alighted	1
from	1
the	1
sleigh,	1
lifted	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
him,	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
report	1
and	1
began	1
speaking	1
in	1
his	1
smooth,	1
ingratiating	1
voice.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
scanned	1
Kutuzov	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot,	1
frowned	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
but	1
immediately	1
mastering	1
himself	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
extended	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
embraced	1
him.	1
And	1
this	1
embrace	1
too,	1
owing	1
to	1
a	1
long-standing	1
impression	1
related	1
to	1
his	1
innermost	1
feelings,	1
had	1
its	1
usual	1
effect	1
on	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
sob.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
greeted	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
the	1
Semenov	1
guard,	1
and	1
again	1
pressing	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
hand	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
When	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
the	1
Emperor	1
expressed	1
his	1
dissatisfaction	1
at	1
the	1
slowness	1
of	1
the	1
pursuit	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
mistakes	1
made	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
and	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
intentions	1
for	1
a	1
future	1
campaign	1
abroad.	1
Kutuzov	1
made	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
or	1
remark.	1
The	1
same	1
submissive,	1
expressionless	1
look	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
commands	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
seven	1
years	1
before	1
settled	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
now.	1
	1
When	1
Kutuzov	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
with	1
lowered	1
head	1
was	1
crossing	1
the	1
ballroom	1
with	1
his	1
heavy	1
waddling	1
gait,	1
he	1
was	1
arrested	1
by	1
someone's	1
voice	1
saying:	1
	1
"Your	1
Serene	1
Highness!"	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Count	1
Tolstoy,	1
who	1
stood	1
before	1
him	1
holding	1
a	1
silver	1
salver	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
a	1
small	1
object.	1
Kutuzov	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
remember;	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
flashed	1
across	1
his	1
puffy	1
face,	1
and	1
bowing	1
low	1
and	1
respectfully	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
object	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
salver.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Class.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
gave	1
a	1
dinner	1
and	1
ball	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
honored	1
by	1
his	1
presence.	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Class	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
highest	1
honors,	1
but	1
everyone	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
imperial	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
him.	1
The	1
proprieties	1
were	1
observed	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
set	1
that	1
example,	1
but	1
everybody	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
blameworthy	1
and	1
good-for-	1
nothing.	1
When	1
Kutuzov,	1
conforming	1
to	1
a	1
custom	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
day,	1
ordered	1
the	1
standards	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
to	1
be	1
lowered	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
feet	1
on	1
his	1
entering	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
made	1
a	1
wry	1
face	1
and	1
muttered	1
something	1
in	1
which	1
some	1
people	1
caught	1
the	1
words,	1
"the	1
old	1
comedian."	1
	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
displeasure	1
with	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
specially	1
increased	1
at	1
Vilna	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
evidently	1
could	1
not	1
or	1
would	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
campaign.	1
	1
When	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
morning	1
the	1
Emperor	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
assembled	1
about	1
him:	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
only	1
saved	1
Russia,	1
you	1
have	1
saved	1
Europe!"	1
they	1
all	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
not	1
ended.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
alone	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
this	1
and	1
openly	1
expressed	1
his	1
opinion	1
that	1
no	1
fresh	1
war	1
could	1
improve	1
the	1
position	1
or	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Russia,	1
but	1
could	1
only	1
spoil	1
and	1
lower	1
the	1
glorious	1
position	1
that	1
Russia	1
had	1
gained.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
levying	1
fresh	1
troops,	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
hardships	1
already	1
endured	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
failure	1
and	1
so	1
forth.	1
	1
This	1
being	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
he	1
was	1
naturally	1
regarded	1
as	1
merely	1
a	1
hindrance	1
and	1
obstacle	1
to	1
the	1
impending	1
war.	1
	1
To	1
avoid	1
unpleasant	1
encounters	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
the	1
natural	1
method	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
Austerlitz	1
and	1
with	1
Barclay	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
campaign--to	1
transfer	1
the	1
authority	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself,	1
thus	1
cutting	1
the	1
ground	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief's	1
feet	1
without	1
upsetting	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
by	1
informing	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
change.	1
	1
With	1
this	1
object	1
his	1
staff	1
was	1
gradually	1
reconstructed	1
and	1
its	1
real	1
strength	1
removed	1
and	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
Toll,	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
and	1
Ermolov	1
received	1
fresh	1
appointments.	1
Everyone	1
spoke	1
loudly	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
great	1
weakness	1
and	1
failing	1
health.	1
	1
His	1
health	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
bad	1
for	1
his	1
place	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
another.	1
And	1
in	1
fact	1
his	1
health	1
was	1
poor.	1
	1
So	1
naturally,	1
simply,	1
and	1
gradually--just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Turkey	1
to	1
the	1
Treasury	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
recruit	1
the	1
militia,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
needed	1
there--now	1
when	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
played	1
out,	1
Kutuzov's	1
place	1
was	1
taken	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
necessary	1
performer.	1
	1
The	1
war	1
of	1
1812,	1
besides	1
its	1
national	1
significance	1
dear	1
to	1
every	1
Russian	1
heart,	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
assume	1
another,	1
a	1
European,	1
significance.	1
	1
The	1
movement	1
of	1
peoples	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
succeeded	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
peoples	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
fresh	1
war	1
another	1
leader	1
was	1
necessary,	1
having	1
qualities	1
and	1
views	1
differing	1
from	1
Kutuzov's	1
and	1
animated	1
by	1
different	1
motives.	1
	1
Alexander	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
refixing	1
of	1
national	1
frontiers	1
as	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
salvation	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
Russia.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
Europe,	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power,	1
or	1
Napoleon	1
meant.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
it.	1
For	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people,	1
after	1
the	1
enemy	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed	1
and	1
Russia	1
had	1
been	1
liberated	1
and	1
raised	1
to	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
her	1
glory,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
left	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
a	1
Russian.	1
Nothing	1
remained	1
for	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
war	1
but	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
died.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
As	1
generally	1
happens,	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
full	1
effects	1
of	1
the	1
physical	1
privation	1
and	1
strain	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
as	1
prisoner	1
until	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
over.	1
After	1
his	1
liberation	1
he	1
reached	1
Orel,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
there,	1
when	1
preparing	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Kiev,	1
he	1
fell	1
ill	1
and	1
was	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
three	1
months.	1
He	1
had	1
what	1
the	1
doctors	1
termed	1
"bilious	1
fever."	1
But	1
despite	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
doctors	1
treated	1
him,	1
bled	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
medicines	1
to	1
drink,	1
he	1
recovered.	1
	1
Scarcely	1
any	1
impression	1
was	1
left	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
mind	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
rescue	1
till	1
his	1
illness.	1
He	1
remembered	1
only	1
the	1
dull	1
gray	1
weather	1
now	1
rainy	1
and	1
now	1
snowy,	1
internal	1
physical	1
distress,	1
and	1
pains	1
in	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
side.	1
He	1
remembered	1
a	1
general	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
sufferings	1
of	1
people	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
worried	1
by	1
the	1
curiosity	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
generals	1
who	1
questioned	1
him,	1
he	1
also	1
remembered	1
his	1
difficulty	1
in	1
procuring	1
a	1
conveyance	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
incapacity	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
feel	1
all	1
that	1
time.	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
rescue	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Petya	1
Rostov.	1
That	1
same	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
after	1
surviving	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
month	1
had	1
recently	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
at	1
Yaroslavl,	1
and	1
Denisov	1
who	1
told	1
him	1
this	1
news	1
also	1
mentioned	1
Helene's	1
death,	1
supposing	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
long	1
before.	1
All	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
seemed	1
merely	1
strange	1
to	1
Pierre:	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
grasp	1
its	1
significance.	1
Just	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
places	1
where	1
people	1
were	1
killing	1
one	1
another,	1
to	1
some	1
peaceful	1
refuge	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
recover	1
himself,	1
rest,	1
and	1
think	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
strange	1
new	1
facts	1
he	1
had	1
learned;	1
but	1
on	1
reaching	1
Orel	1
he	1
immediately	1
fell	1
ill.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
after	1
his	1
illness	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
him	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
Terenty	1
and	1
Vaska,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Moscow;	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
cousin	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
on	1
his	1
estate	1
at	1
Elets	1
and	1
hearing	1
of	1
his	1
rescue	1
and	1
illness	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
gradually	1
during	1
his	1
convalescence	1
that	1
Pierre	1
lost	1
the	1
impressions	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
accustomed	1
to	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
months	1
and	1
got	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere	1
tomorrow,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
deprive	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
warm	1
bed,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
dinner,	1
tea,	1
and	1
supper.	1
But	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
dreams	1
he	1
still	1
saw	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
captivity.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
after	1
his	1
rescue,	1
about	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
A	1
joyous	1
feeling	1
of	1
freedom--that	1
complete	1
inalienable	1
freedom	1
natural	1
to	1
man	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
experienced	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
halt	1
outside	1
Moscow--	1
filled	1
Pierre's	1
soul	1
during	1
his	1
convalescence.	1
He	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
this	1
inner	1
freedom,	1
which	1
was	1
independent	1
of	1
external	1
conditions,	1
now	1
had	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
an	1
additional	1
setting	1
of	1
external	1
liberty.	1
He	1
was	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
town,	1
without	1
acquaintances.	1
No	1
one	1
demanded	1
anything	1
of	1
him	1
or	1
sent	1
him	1
anywhere.	1
He	1
had	1
all	1
he	1
wanted:	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
continual	1
torment	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there,	1
since	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
good!	1
How	1
splendid!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself	1
when	1
a	1
cleanly	1
laid	1
table	1
was	1
moved	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
savory	1
beef	1
tea,	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
a	1
soft	1
clean	1
bed,	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
no	1
more.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
good,	1
how	1
splendid!"	1
	1
And	1
by	1
old	1
habit	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
the	1
question:	1
"Well,	1
and	1
what	1
then?	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
going	1
to	1
do?"	1
And	1
he	1
immediately	1
gave	1
himself	1
the	1
answer:	1
"Well,	1
I	1
shall	1
live.	1
Ah,	1
how	1
splendid!"	1
	1
The	1
very	1
question	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
tormented	1
him,	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
had	1
continually	1
sought	1
to	1
find--the	1
aim	1
of	1
life--no	1
longer	1
existed	1
for	1
him	1
now.	1
That	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
disappeared	1
temporarily--he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
no	1
longer	1
existed	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
present	1
itself	1
again.	1
And	1
this	1
very	1
absence	1
of	1
an	1
aim	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
complete,	1
joyous	1
sense	1
of	1
freedom	1
which	1
constituted	1
his	1
happiness	1
at	1
this	1
time.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
an	1
aim,	1
for	1
he	1
now	1
had	1
faith--not	1
faith	1
in	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
rule,	1
or	1
words,	1
or	1
ideas,	1
but	1
faith	1
in	1
an	1
ever-living,	1
ever-manifest	1
God.	1
Formerly	1
he	1
had	1
sought	1
Him	1
in	1
aims	1
he	1
set	1
himself.	1
That	1
search	1
for	1
an	1
aim	1
had	1
been	1
simply	1
a	1
search	1
for	1
God,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
in	1
his	1
captivity	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
not	1
by	1
words	1
or	1
reasoning	1
but	1
by	1
direct	1
feeling	1
what	1
his	1
nurse	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
long	1
ago:	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
here	1
and	1
everywhere.	1
In	1
his	1
captivity	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
in	1
Karataev	1
God	1
was	1
greater,	1
more	1
infinite	1
and	1
unfathomable	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
Architect	1
of	1
the	1
Universe	1
recognized	1
by	1
the	1
Freemasons.	1
He	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
after	1
straining	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
see	1
into	1
the	1
far	1
distance	1
finds	1
what	1
he	1
sought	1
at	1
his	1
very	1
feet.	1
All	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
around	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
merely	1
looked	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
without	1
straining	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
past	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
great	1
inscrutable	1
infinite	1
something.	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
exist	1
somewhere	1
and	1
had	1
looked	1
for	1
it.	1
In	1
everything	1
near	1
and	1
comprehensible	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
what	1
was	1
limited,	1
petty,	1
commonplace,	1
and	1
senseless.	1
He	1
had	1
equipped	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
mental	1
telescope	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
remote	1
space,	1
where	1
petty	1
worldliness	1
hiding	1
itself	1
in	1
misty	1
distance	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
great	1
and	1
infinite	1
merely	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
clearly	1
seen.	1
And	1
such	1
had	1
European	1
life,	1
politics,	1
Freemasonry,	1
philosophy,	1
and	1
philanthropy	1
seemed	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
even	1
then,	1
at	1
moments	1
of	1
weakness	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
accounted	1
them,	1
his	1
mind	1
had	1
penetrated	1
to	1
those	1
distances	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
there	1
seen	1
the	1
same	1
pettiness,	1
worldliness,	1
and	1
senselessness.	1
Now,	1
however,	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
great,	1
eternal,	1
and	1
infinite	1
in	1
everything,	1
and	1
therefore--to	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
enjoy	1
its	1
contemplation--he	1
naturally	1
threw	1
away	1
the	1
telescope	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
till	1
now	1
gazed	1
over	1
men's	1
heads,	1
and	1
gladly	1
regarded	1
the	1
ever-changing,	1
eternally	1
great,	1
unfathomable,	1
and	1
infinite	1
life	1
around	1
him.	1
And	1
the	1
closer	1
he	1
looked	1
the	1
more	1
tranquil	1
and	1
happy	1
he	1
became.	1
That	1
dreadful	1
question,	1
"What	1
for?"	1
which	1
had	1
formerly	1
destroyed	1
all	1
his	1
mental	1
edifices,	1
no	1
longer	1
existed	1
for	1
him.	1
To	1
that	1
question,	1
"What	1
for?"	1
a	1
simple	1
answer	1
was	1
now	1
always	1
ready	1
in	1
his	1
soul:	1
"Because	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God,	1
that	1
God	1
without	1
whose	1
will	1
not	1
one	1
hair	1
falls	1
from	1
a	1
man's	1
head."	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
In	1
external	1
ways	1
Pierre	1
had	1
hardly	1
changed	1
at	1
all.	1
In	1
appearance	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
be.	1
As	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
absent-minded	1
and	1
seemed	1
occupied	1
not	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
but	1
with	1
something	1
special	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
difference	1
between	1
his	1
former	1
and	1
present	1
self	1
was	1
that	1
formerly	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
grasp	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
or	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
puckered	1
his	1
forehead	1
painfully	1
as	1
if	1
vainly	1
seeking	1
to	1
distinguish	1
something	1
at	1
a	1
distance.	1
At	1
present	1
he	1
still	1
forgot	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
but	1
he	1
now	1
looked	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
and	1
seemingly	1
ironic	1
smile	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
said,	1
though	1
evidently	1
seeing	1
and	1
hearing	1
something	1
quite	1
different.	1
Formerly	1
he	1
had	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
kindhearted	1
but	1
unhappy	1
man,	1
and	1
so	1
people	1
had	1
been	1
inclined	1
to	1
avoid	1
him.	1
Now	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
life	1
always	1
played	1
round	1
his	1
lips,	1
and	1
sympathy	1
for	1
others,	1
shone	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
questioning	1
look	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
contented	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
people	1
felt	1
pleased	1
by	1
his	1
presence.	1
	1
Previously	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
grew	1
excited	1
when	1
he	1
talked,	1
and	1
seldom	1
listened;	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
seldom	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
conversation	1
and	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
listen	1
so	1
that	1
people	1
readily	1
told	1
him	1
their	1
most	1
intimate	1
secrets.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
liked	1
Pierre	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
particularly	1
hostile	1
to	1
him	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
herself	1
under	1
obligations	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
old	1
count's	1
death,	1
now	1
after	1
staying	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
in	1
Orel--where	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
intending	1
to	1
show	1
Pierre	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
ingratitude	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
nurse	1
him--felt	1
to	1
her	1
surprise	1
and	1
vexation	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
fond	1
of	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
seek	1
her	1
approval,	1
he	1
merely	1
studied	1
her	1
with	1
interest.	1
Formerly	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
regarded	1
her	1
with	1
indifference	1
and	1
irony,	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
shrunk	1
into	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
with	1
others	1
and	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
only	1
the	1
combative	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
nature;	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
places	1
of	1
her	1
heart,	1
and,	1
mistrustfully	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
afterwards	1
gratefully,	1
she	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
the	1
hidden,	1
kindly	1
sides	1
of	1
her	1
character.	1
	1
The	1
most	1
cunning	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
crept	1
into	1
her	1
confidence	1
more	1
successfully,	1
evoking	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
times	1
of	1
her	1
youth	1
and	1
showing	1
sympathy	1
with	1
them.	1
Yet	1
Pierre's	1
cunning	1
consisted	1
simply	1
in	1
finding	1
pleasure	1
in	1
drawing	1
out	1
the	1
human	1
qualities	1
of	1
the	1
embittered,	1
hard,	1
and	1
(in	1
her	1
own	1
way)	1
proud	1
princess.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very,	1
very	1
kind	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
bad	1
people	1
but	1
of	1
people	1
such	1
as	1
myself,"	1
thought	1
she.	1
	1
His	1
servants	1
too--Terenty	1
and	1
Vaska--in	1
their	1
own	1
way	1
noticed	1
the	1
change	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
Pierre.	1
They	1
considered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
much	1
"simpler."	1
Terenty,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
helped	1
him	1
undress	1
and	1
wished	1
him	1
good	1
night,	1
often	1
lingered	1
with	1
his	1
master's	1
boots	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
clothes	1
over	1
his	1
arm,	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
start	1
a	1
talk.	1
And	1
Pierre,	1
noticing	1
that	1
Terenty	1
wanted	1
a	1
chat,	1
generally	1
kept	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
"Well,	1
tell	1
me...	1
now,	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
food?"	1
he	1
would	1
ask.	1
	1
And	1
Terenty	1
would	1
begin	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
and	1
would	1
stand	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
holding	1
the	1
clothes	1
and	1
talking,	1
or	1
sometimes	1
listening	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
stories,	1
and	1
then	1
would	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
sense	1
of	1
intimacy	1
with	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
affection	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
who	1
attended	1
Pierre	1
and	1
visited	1
him	1
every	1
day,	1
though	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
doctor	1
to	1
pose	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
every	1
moment	1
was	1
of	1
value	1
to	1
suffering	1
humanity,	1
would	1
sit	1
for	1
hours	1
with	1
Pierre	1
telling	1
him	1
his	1
favorite	1
anecdotes	1
and	1
his	1
observations	1
on	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
his	1
patients	1
in	1
general,	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
ladies.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
that;	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
like	1
our	1
provincials,"	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
several	1
prisoners	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
in	1
Orel,	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
brought	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
young	1
Italian,	1
to	1
see	1
Pierre.	1
	1
This	1
officer	1
began	1
visiting	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
used	1
to	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
the	1
tenderness	1
the	1
Italian	1
expressed	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
Italian	1
seemed	1
happy	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
Pierre,	1
talk	1
with	1
him,	1
tell	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
past,	1
his	1
life	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
his	1
love,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
especially	1
against	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
"If	1
all	1
Russians	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
like	1
you,	1
it	1
is	1
sacrilege	1
to	1
fight	1
such	1
a	1
nation,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"You,	1
who	1
have	1
suffered	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
feel	1
animosity	1
toward	1
them."	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
evoked	1
the	1
passionate	1
affection	1
of	1
the	1
Italian	1
merely	1
by	1
evoking	1
the	1
best	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
nature	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
pleasure	1
in	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
stay	1
in	1
Orel	1
his	1
old	1
masonic	1
acquaintance	1
Count	1
Willarski,	1
who	1
had	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
lodge	1
in	1
1807,	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Willarski	1
was	1
married	1
to	1
a	1
Russian	1
heiress	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
large	1
estate	1
in	1
Orel	1
province,	1
and	1
he	1
occupied	1
a	1
temporary	1
post	1
in	1
the	1
commissariat	1
department	1
in	1
that	1
town.	1
	1
Hearing	1
that	1
Bezukhov	1
was	1
in	1
Orel,	1
Willarski,	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
intimate,	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
professions	1
of	1
friendship	1
and	1
intimacy	1
that	1
people	1
who	1
meet	1
in	1
a	1
desert	1
generally	1
express	1
for	1
one	1
another.	1
Willarski	1
felt	1
dull	1
in	1
Orel	1
and	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
circle	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
supposed,	1
of	1
similar	1
interests.	1
	1
But	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
Willarski	1
soon	1
noticed	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
lagged	1
much	1
behind	1
the	1
times,	1
and	1
had	1
sunk,	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
it	1
to	1
himself,	1
into	1
apathy	1
and	1
egotism.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
letting	1
yourself	1
go,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
But	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
Willarski	1
found	1
it	1
pleasanter	1
now	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
formerly	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
every	1
day.	1
To	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
Willarski,	1
it	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
like	1
that	1
himself	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
before.	1
	1
Willarski	1
was	1
a	1
married	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
family,	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
affairs,	1
his	1
wife's	1
affairs,	1
and	1
his	1
official	1
duties.	1
He	1
regarded	1
all	1
these	1
occupations	1
as	1
hindrances	1
to	1
life,	1
and	1
considered	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
contemptible	1
because	1
their	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
family.	1
Military,	1
administrative,	1
political,	1
and	1
masonic	1
interests	1
continually	1
absorbed	1
his	1
attention.	1
And	1
Pierre,	1
without	1
trying	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
other's	1
views	1
and	1
without	1
condemning	1
him,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
quiet,	1
joyful,	1
and	1
amused	1
smile	1
now	1
habitual	1
to	1
him,	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
this	1
strange	1
though	1
very	1
familiar	1
phenomenon.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
feature	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
relations	1
with	1
Willarski,	1
with	1
the	1
princess,	1
with	1
the	1
doctor,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
now	1
met,	1
which	1
gained	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
will.	1
This	1
was	1
his	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
changing	1
a	1
man's	1
convictions	1
by	1
words,	1
and	1
his	1
recognition	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
everyone	1
thinking,	1
feeling,	1
and	1
seeing	1
things	1
each	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
This	1
legitimate	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
each	1
individual	1
which	1
used	1
to	1
excite	1
and	1
irritate	1
Pierre	1
now	1
became	1
a	1
basis	1
of	1
the	1
sympathy	1
he	1
felt	1
for,	1
and	1
the	1
interest	1
he	1
took	1
in,	1
other	1
people.	1
The	1
difference,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
complete	1
contradiction,	1
between	1
men's	1
opinions	1
and	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
between	1
one	1
man	1
and	1
another,	1
pleased	1
him	1
and	1
drew	1
from	1
him	1
an	1
amused	1
and	1
gentle	1
smile.	1
	1
In	1
practical	1
matters	1
Pierre	1
unexpectedly	1
felt	1
within	1
himself	1
a	1
center	1
of	1
gravity	1
he	1
had	1
previously	1
lacked.	1
Formerly	1
all	1
pecuniary	1
questions,	1
especially	1
requests	1
for	1
money	1
to	1
which,	1
as	1
an	1
extremely	1
wealthy	1
man,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
exposed,	1
produced	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
hopeless	1
agitation	1
and	1
perplexity.	1
"To	1
give	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
give?"	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
himself.	1
"I	1
have	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
needs	1
it.	1
But	1
someone	1
else	1
needs	1
it	1
still	1
more.	1
Who	1
needs	1
it	1
most?	1
And	1
perhaps	1
they	1
are	1
both	1
impostors?"	1
In	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
surmises	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
asked	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
give.	1
Formerly	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
state	1
of	1
perplexity	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
every	1
question	1
concerning	1
his	1
property,	1
when	1
one	1
person	1
advised	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
another	1
something	1
else.	1
	1
Now	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
felt	1
either	1
doubt	1
or	1
perplexity	1
about	1
these	1
questions.	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
within	1
him	1
a	1
judge	1
who	1
by	1
some	1
rule	1
unknown	1
to	1
him	1
decided	1
what	1
should	1
or	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
indifferent	1
as	1
heretofore	1
to	1
money	1
matters,	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
certain	1
of	1
what	1
ought	1
and	1
what	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
his	1
new	1
judge	1
was	1
when	1
a	1
French	1
prisoner,	1
a	1
colonel,	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
after	1
talking	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
his	1
exploits,	1
concluded	1
by	1
making	1
what	1
amounted	1
to	1
a	1
demand	1
that	1
Pierre	1
should	1
give	1
him	1
four	1
thousand	1
francs	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
children.	1
Pierre	1
refused	1
without	1
the	1
least	1
difficulty	1
or	1
effort,	1
and	1
was	1
afterwards	1
surprised	1
how	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
had	1
been	1
what	1
used	1
to	1
appear	1
so	1
insurmountably	1
difficult.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
refused	1
the	1
colonel's	1
demand	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
artifice	1
when	1
leaving	1
Orel,	1
to	1
induce	1
the	1
Italian	1
officer	1
to	1
accept	1
some	1
money	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
in	1
need.	1
A	1
further	1
proof	1
to	1
Pierre	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
more	1
settled	1
outlook	1
on	1
practical	1
matters	1
was	1
furnished	1
by	1
his	1
decision	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
wife's	1
debts	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rebuilding	1
of	1
his	1
houses	1
in	1
and	1
near	1
Moscow.	1
	1
His	1
head	1
steward	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
Orel	1
and	1
Pierre	1
reckoned	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
his	1
diminished	1
income.	1
The	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
had	1
cost	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
steward's	1
calculation,	1
about	1
two	1
million	1
rubles.	1
	1
To	1
console	1
Pierre	1
for	1
these	1
losses	1
the	1
head	1
steward	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
estimate	1
showing	1
that	1
despite	1
these	1
losses	1
his	1
income	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
diminished	1
but	1
would	1
even	1
be	1
increased	1
if	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
wife's	1
debts	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
under	1
no	1
obligation	1
to	1
meet,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
rebuild	1
his	1
Moscow	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
house	1
on	1
his	1
Moscow	1
estate,	1
which	1
had	1
cost	1
him	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
nothing.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
of	1
course	1
that's	1
true,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
smile.	1
"I	1
don't	1
need	1
all	1
that	1
at	1
all.	1
By	1
being	1
ruined	1
I	1
have	1
become	1
much	1
richer."	1
	1
But	1
in	1
January	1
Savelich	1
came	1
from	1
Moscow	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
there,	1
and	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
estimate	1
an	1
architect	1
had	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
rebuilding	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
country	1
houses,	1
speaking	1
of	1
this	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
settled	1
matter.	1
About	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
received	1
letters	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
other	1
Petersburg	1
acquaintances	1
speaking	1
of	1
his	1
wife's	1
debts.	1
And	1
Pierre	1
decided	1
that	1
the	1
steward's	1
proposals	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
pleased	1
him	1
were	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
settle	1
his	1
wife's	1
affairs	1
and	1
must	1
rebuild	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Why	1
this	1
was	1
necessary	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary.	1
His	1
income	1
would	1
be	1
reduced	1
by	1
three	1
fourths,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
Willarski	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
they	1
agreed	1
to	1
travel	1
together.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
convalescence	1
in	1
Orel	1
Pierre	1
had	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy,	1
freedom,	1
and	1
life;	1
but	1
when	1
during	1
his	1
journey	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
world	1
and	1
saw	1
hundreds	1
of	1
new	1
faces,	1
that	1
feeling	1
was	1
intensified.	1
Throughout	1
his	1
journey	1
he	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
on	1
holiday.	1
Everyone--the	1
stagecoach	1
driver,	1
the	1
post-house	1
overseers,	1
the	1
peasants	1
on	1
the	1
roads	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
villages--had	1
a	1
new	1
significance	1
for	1
him.	1
The	1
presence	1
and	1
remarks	1
of	1
Willarski	1
who	1
continually	1
deplored	1
the	1
ignorance	1
and	1
poverty	1
of	1
Russia	1
and	1
its	1
backwardness	1
compared	1
with	1
Europe	1
only	1
heightened	1
Pierre's	1
pleasure.	1
Where	1
Willarski	1
saw	1
deadness	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
strength	1
and	1
vitality--the	1
strength	1
which	1
in	1
that	1
vast	1
space	1
amid	1
the	1
snows	1
maintained	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
this	1
original,	1
peculiar,	1
and	1
unique	1
people.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
contradict	1
Willarski	1
and	1
even	1
seemed	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
him--an	1
apparent	1
agreement	1
being	1
the	1
simplest	1
way	1
to	1
avoid	1
discussions	1
that	1
could	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing--and	1
he	1
smiled	1
joyfully	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
explain	1
why	1
and	1
whither	1
ants	1
whose	1
heap	1
has	1
been	1
destroyed	1
are	1
hurrying:	1
some	1
from	1
the	1
heap	1
dragging	1
bits	1
of	1
rubbish,	1
larvae,	1
and	1
corpses,	1
others	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
heap,	1
or	1
why	1
they	1
jostle,	1
overtake	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
fight,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
equally	1
difficult	1
to	1
explain	1
what	1
caused	1
the	1
Russians	1
after	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
throng	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
Moscow.	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
watch	1
the	1
ants	1
round	1
their	1
ruined	1
heap,	1
the	1
tenacity,	1
energy,	1
and	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
delving	1
insects	1
prove	1
that	1
despite	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
heap,	1
something	1
indestructible,	1
which	1
though	1
intangible	1
is	1
the	1
real	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
colony,	1
still	1
exists;	1
and	1
similarly,	1
though	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
October	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
government	1
and	1
no	1
churches,	1
shrines,	1
riches,	1
or	1
houses--it	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
Moscow	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
August.	1
All	1
was	1
destroyed,	1
except	1
something	1
intangible	1
yet	1
powerful	1
and	1
indestructible.	1
	1
The	1
motives	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
thronged	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
to	1
Moscow	1
after	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
cleared	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
were	1
most	1
diverse	1
and	1
personal,	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
savage	1
and	1
brutal.	1
One	1
motive	1
only	1
they	1
all	1
had	1
in	1
common:	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
Moscow,	1
to	1
apply	1
their	1
activities	1
there.	1
	1
Within	1
a	1
week	1
Moscow	1
already	1
had	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
inhabitants,	1
in	1
a	1
fortnight	1
twenty-five	1
thousand,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
By	1
the	1
autumn	1
of	1
1813	1
the	1
number,	1
ever	1
increasing	1
and	1
increasing,	1
exceeded	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
1812.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
Russians	1
to	1
enter	1
Moscow	1
were	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
of	1
Wintzingerode's	1
detachment,	1
peasants	1
from	1
the	1
adjacent	1
villages,	1
and	1
residents	1
who	1
had	1
fled	1
from	1
Moscow	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
hiding	1
in	1
its	1
vicinity.	1
The	1
Russians	1
who	1
entered	1
Moscow,	1
finding	1
it	1
plundered,	1
plundered	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
turn.	1
They	1
continued	1
what	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
begun.	1
Trains	1
of	1
peasant	1
carts	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
villages	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
in	1
the	1
ruined	1
houses	1
and	1
the	1
streets.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
carried	1
off	1
what	1
they	1
could	1
to	1
their	1
camps,	1
and	1
the	1
householders	1
seized	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
find	1
in	1
other	1
houses	1
and	1
moved	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
own,	1
pretending	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
property.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
first	1
plunderers	1
were	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
contingent,	1
and	1
with	1
increasing	1
numbers	1
plundering	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
difficult	1
and	1
assumed	1
more	1
definite	1
forms.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
found	1
Moscow	1
abandoned	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
organizations	1
of	1
regular	1
life,	1
with	1
diverse	1
branches	1
of	1
commerce	1
and	1
craftsmanship,	1
with	1
luxury,	1
and	1
governmental	1
and	1
religious	1
institutions.	1
These	1
forms	1
were	1
lifeless	1
but	1
still	1
existed.	1
There	1
were	1
bazaars,	1
shops,	1
warehouses,	1
market	1
stalls,	1
granaries--for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
still	1
stocked	1
with	1
goods--	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
factories	1
and	1
workshops,	1
palaces	1
and	1
wealthy	1
houses	1
filled	1
with	1
luxuries,	1
hospitals,	1
prisons,	1
government	1
offices,	1
churches,	1
and	1
cathedrals.	1
The	1
longer	1
the	1
French	1
remained	1
the	1
more	1
these	1
forms	1
of	1
town	1
life	1
perished,	1
until	1
finally	1
all	1
was	1
merged	1
into	1
one	1
confused,	1
lifeless	1
scene	1
of	1
plunder.	1
	1
The	1
more	1
the	1
plundering	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
continued,	1
the	1
more	1
both	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
its	1
plunderers	1
was	1
destroyed.	1
But	1
plundering	1
by	1
the	1
Russians,	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
reoccupation	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
began,	1
had	1
an	1
opposite	1
effect:	1
the	1
longer	1
it	1
continued	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
people	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
more	1
rapidly	1
was	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
its	1
regular	1
life	1
restored.	1
	1
Besides	1
the	1
plunderers,	1
very	1
various	1
people,	1
some	1
drawn	1
by	1
curiosity,	1
some	1
by	1
official	1
duties,	1
some	1
by	1
self-interest--house	1
owners,	1
clergy,	1
officials	1
of	1
all	1
kinds,	1
tradesmen,	1
artisans,	1
and	1
peasants--streamed	1
into	1
Moscow	1
as	1
blood	1
flows	1
to	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
Within	1
a	1
week	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
empty	1
carts	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
plunder	1
were	1
stopped	1
by	1
the	1
authorities	1
and	1
made	1
to	1
cart	1
the	1
corpses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
Other	1
peasants,	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
their	1
comrades'	1
discomfiture,	1
came	1
to	1
town	1
bringing	1
rye,	1
oats,	1
and	1
hay,	1
and	1
beat	1
down	1
one	1
another's	1
prices	1
to	1
below	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
former	1
days.	1
Gangs	1
of	1
carpenters	1
hoping	1
for	1
high	1
pay	1
arrived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
logs	1
were	1
being	1
hewn,	1
new	1
houses	1
built,	1
and	1
old,	1
charred	1
ones	1
repaired.	1
Tradesmen	1
began	1
trading	1
in	1
booths.	1
Cookshops	1
and	1
taverns	1
were	1
opened	1
in	1
partially	1
burned	1
houses.	1
The	1
clergy	1
resumed	1
the	1
services	1
in	1
many	1
churches	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
burned.	1
Donors	1
contributed	1
Church	1
property	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
stolen.	1
Government	1
clerks	1
set	1
up	1
their	1
baize-	1
covered	1
tables	1
and	1
their	1
pigeonholes	1
of	1
documents	1
in	1
small	1
rooms.	1
The	1
higher	1
authorities	1
and	1
the	1
police	1
organized	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
goods	1
left	1
behind	1
by	1
the	1
French.	1
The	1
owners	1
of	1
houses	1
in	1
which	1
much	1
property	1
had	1
been	1
left,	1
brought	1
there	1
from	1
other	1
houses,	1
complained	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
taking	1
everything	1
to	1
the	1
Faceted	1
Palace	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin;	1
others	1
insisted	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
gathered	1
things	1
from	1
different	1
houses	1
into	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
house,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unfair	1
to	1
allow	1
its	1
owner	1
to	1
keep	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
there.	1
They	1
abused	1
the	1
police	1
and	1
bribed	1
them,	1
made	1
out	1
estimates	1
at	1
ten	1
times	1
their	1
value	1
for	1
government	1
stores	1
that	1
had	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
demanded	1
relief.	1
And	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
wrote	1
proclamations.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
January	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
stayed	1
in	1
an	1
annex	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
burned.	1
He	1
called	1
on	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
and	1
on	1
some	1
acquaintances	1
who	1
were	1
back	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
leave	1
for	1
Petersburg	1
two	1
days	1
later.	1
Everybody	1
was	1
celebrating	1
the	1
victory,	1
everything	1
was	1
bubbling	1
with	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
ruined	1
but	1
reviving	1
city.	1
Everyone	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
Pierre,	1
everyone	1
wished	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
everyone	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
particularly	1
well	1
disposed	1
toward	1
them	1
all,	1
but	1
was	1
now	1
instinctively	1
on	1
his	1
guard	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
binding	1
himself	1
in	1
any	1
way.	1
To	1
all	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
him--	1
whether	1
important	1
or	1
quite	1
trifling--such	1
as:	1
Where	1
would	1
he	1
live?	1
Was	1
he	1
going	1
to	1
rebuild?	1
When	1
was	1
he	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
would	1
he	1
mind	1
taking	1
a	1
parcel	1
for	1
someone?--he	1
replied:	1
"Yes,	1
perhaps,"	1
or,	1
"I	1
think	1
so,"	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
at	1
Kostroma	1
but	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
Natasha	1
seldom	1
occurred	1
to	1
him.	1
If	1
it	1
did	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
pleasant	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
distant	1
past.	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
not	1
only	1
free	1
from	1
social	1
obligations	1
but	1
also	1
from	1
that	1
feeling	1
which,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
aroused	1
in	1
himself.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
Drubetskoys	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
death,	1
sufferings,	1
and	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
often	1
occupied	1
Pierre's	1
thoughts	1
and	1
now	1
recurred	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
fresh	1
vividness.	1
Having	1
heard	1
at	1
dinner	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
living	1
in	1
her	1
house--which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
burned--in	1
Vozdvizhenka	1
Street,	1
he	1
drove	1
that	1
same	1
evening	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
Pierre	1
kept	1
thinking	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
of	1
their	1
friendship,	1
of	1
his	1
various	1
meetings	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
one	1
at	1
Borodino.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
bitter	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
in?	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
not	1
disclosed	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
died?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
recalled	1
Karataev	1
and	1
his	1
death	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
began	1
to	1
compare	1
these	1
two	1
men,	1
so	1
different,	1
and	1
yet	1
so	1
similar	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
lived	1
and	1
both	1
died	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
Pierre	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
serious	1
mood.	1
The	1
house	1
had	1
escaped	1
the	1
fire;	1
it	1
showed	1
signs	1
of	1
damage	1
but	1
its	1
general	1
aspect	1
was	1
unchanged.	1
The	1
old	1
footman,	1
who	1
met	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
visitor	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
not	1
disturbed	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
apartments,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
received	1
on	1
Sundays.	1
	1
"Announce	1
me.	1
Perhaps	1
she	1
will	1
see	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
man.	1
"Please	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
portrait	1
gallery."	1
	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
footman	1
returned	1
with	1
Dessalles,	1
who	1
brought	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
Pierre	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
excuse	1
her	1
want	1
of	1
ceremony	1
and	1
come	1
upstairs	1
to	1
her	1
apartment.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
rather	1
low	1
room	1
lit	1
by	1
one	1
candle	1
sat	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
another	1
person	1
dressed	1
in	1
black.	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
always	1
had	1
lady	1
companions,	1
but	1
who	1
they	1
were	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
like	1
he	1
never	1
knew	1
or	1
remembered.	1
"This	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
companions,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
dress.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
rose	1
quickly	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
she	1
said,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
altered	1
face	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
"so	1
this	1
is	1
how	1
we	1
meet	1
again.	1
He	1
spoke	1
of	1
you	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
last,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
Pierre	1
to	1
her	1
companion	1
with	1
a	1
shyness	1
that	1
surprised	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
instant.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
safety.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
piece	1
of	1
good	1
news	1
we	1
had	1
received	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time."	1
	1
Again	1
the	1
princess	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
companion	1
with	1
even	1
more	1
uneasiness	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
add	1
something,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
interrupted	1
her.	1
	1
"Just	1
imagine--I	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
him!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
killed.	1
All	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
heard	1
at	1
second	1
hand	1
from	1
others.	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs....	1
What	1
a	1
strange	1
coincidence!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
rapidly	1
and	1
with	1
animation.	1
He	1
glanced	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
companion's	1
face,	1
saw	1
her	1
attentive	1
and	1
kindly	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
and,	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
talking,	1
felt	1
somehow	1
that	1
this	1
companion	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
dress	1
was	1
a	1
good,	1
kind,	1
excellent	1
creature	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
hinder	1
his	1
conversing	1
freely	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
mentioned	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
face	1
expressed	1
still	1
greater	1
embarrassment.	1
She	1
again	1
glanced	1
rapidly	1
from	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
dress	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
not	1
recognize	1
her?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
companion's	1
pale,	1
delicate	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
black	1
eyes	1
and	1
peculiar	1
mouth,	1
and	1
something	1
near	1
to	1
him,	1
long	1
forgotten	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
sweet,	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
those	1
attentive	1
eyes.	1
	1
"But	1
no,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"This	1
stern,	1
thin,	1
pale	1
face	1
that	1
looks	1
so	1
much	1
older!	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
she.	1
It	1
merely	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
her."	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
said,	1
"Natasha!"	1
And	1
with	1
difficulty,	1
effort,	1
and	1
stress,	1
like	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
a	1
door	1
grown	1
rusty	1
on	1
its	1
hinges,	1
a	1
smile	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
attentive	1
eyes,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
opening	1
door	1
came	1
a	1
breath	1
of	1
fragrance	1
which	1
suffused	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
happiness	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
forgotten	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
been	1
thinking--especially	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
It	1
suffused	1
him,	1
seized	1
him,	1
and	1
enveloped	1
him	1
completely.	1
When	1
she	1
smiled	1
doubt	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
possible,	1
it	1
was	1
Natasha	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
her.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
involuntarily	1
betrayed	1
to	1
her,	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
himself,	1
a	1
secret	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
been	1
unaware.	1
He	1
flushed	1
joyfully	1
yet	1
with	1
painful	1
distress.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
agitation.	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
the	1
more	1
clearly--clearer	1
than	1
any	1
words	1
could	1
have	1
done--did	1
he	1
betray	1
to	1
himself,	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
her.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
only	1
the	1
unexpectedness	1
of	1
it,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
again	1
glanced	1
at	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
a	1
still-deeper	1
flush	1
suffused	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
still-stronger	1
agitation	1
of	1
mingled	1
joy	1
and	1
fear	1
seized	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
became	1
confused	1
in	1
his	1
speech	1
and	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
failed	1
to	1
notice	1
Natasha	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
there,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
failed	1
to	1
recognize	1
her	1
because	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
since	1
he	1
last	1
saw	1
her	1
was	1
immense.	1
She	1
had	1
grown	1
thin	1
and	1
pale,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
made	1
her	1
unrecognizable;	1
she	1
was	1
unrecognizable	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
entered	1
because	1
on	1
that	1
face	1
whose	1
eyes	1
had	1
always	1
shone	1
with	1
a	1
suppressed	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
life,	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
entered	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
smile:	1
only	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
kindly	1
attentive	1
and	1
sadly	1
interrogative.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
confusion	1
was	1
not	1
reflected	1
by	1
any	1
confusion	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
part,	1
but	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
pleasure	1
that	1
just	1
perceptibly	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
whole	1
face.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
"She	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
me,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"The	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
The	1
countess	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
state;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
Natasha	1
herself	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
doctor.	1
They	1
insisted	1
on	1
her	1
coming	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
family	1
free	1
from	1
sorrow	1
now?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
addressing	1
Natasha.	1
"You	1
know	1
it	1
happened	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
rescued.	1
I	1
saw	1
him.	1
What	1
a	1
delightful	1
boy	1
he	1
was!"	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
her	1
eyes	1
widened	1
and	1
lit	1
up.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
one	1
say	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
as	1
a	1
consolation?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Nothing!	1
Why	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
splendid	1
boy,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
life,	1
to	1
die?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
live	1
without	1
faith..."	1
remarked	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
that	1
is	1
really	1
true,"	1
Pierre	1
hastily	1
interrupted	1
her.	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
true?"	1
Natasha	1
asked,	1
looking	1
attentively	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
ask	1
why?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"The	1
thought	1
alone	1
of	1
what	1
awaits..."	1
	1
Natasha	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
finish	1
again	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"And	1
because,"	1
Pierre	1
continued,	1
"only	1
one	1
who	1
believes	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
ruling	1
us	1
can	1
bear	1
a	1
loss	1
such	1
as	1
hers	1
and...	1
yours."	1
	1
Natasha	1
had	1
already	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
suddenly	1
stopped.	1
Pierre	1
hurriedly	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
again	1
addressed	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
asking	1
about	1
his	1
friend's	1
last	1
days.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
confusion	1
had	1
now	1
almost	1
vanished,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
freedom	1
had	1
also	1
completely	1
gone.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
judge	1
of	1
his	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
action	1
whose	1
judgment	1
mattered	1
more	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
considering	1
what	1
impression	1
his	1
words	1
would	1
make	1
on	1
Natasha.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
purposely	1
say	1
things	1
to	1
please	1
her,	1
but	1
whatever	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
he	1
regarded	1
from	1
her	1
standpoint.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary--reluctantly	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
such	1
cases--began	1
telling	1
of	1
the	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
But	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
quivering	1
with	1
emotion,	1
his	1
questions	1
and	1
his	1
eager	1
restless	1
expression,	1
gradually	1
compelled	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
details	1
which	1
she	1
feared	1
to	1
recall	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
sake.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
and	1
so...?"	1
Pierre	1
kept	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
toward	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
and	1
eagerly	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
story.	1
"Yes,	1
yes...	1
so	1
he	1
grew	1
tranquil	1
and	1
softened?	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
soul	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
sought	1
one	1
thing--to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
good--so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
death.	1
The	1
faults	1
he	1
had--if	1
he	1
had	1
any--were	1
not	1
of	1
his	1
making.	1
So	1
he	1
did	1
soften?...	1
What	1
a	1
happy	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
you	1
again,"	1
he	1
added,	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
Natasha	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears.	1
	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
twitched.	1
She	1
frowned	1
and	1
lowered	1
her	1
eyes	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
She	1
hesitated	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
whether	1
to	1
speak	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
was	1
happiness,"	1
she	1
then	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
quiet	1
voice	1
with	1
its	1
deep	1
chest	1
notes.	1
"For	1
me	1
it	1
certainly	1
was	1
happiness."	1
She	1
paused.	1
"And	1
he...	1
he...	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
wishing	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
room...."	1
	1
Natasha's	1
voice	1
broke.	1
She	1
blushed,	1
pressed	1
her	1
clasped	1
hands	1
on	1
her	1
knees,	1
and	1
then	1
controlling	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
evident	1
effort	1
lifted	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
rapidly.	1
	1
"We	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
we	1
started	1
from	1
Moscow.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
ask	1
about	1
him.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
Sonya	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
traveling	1
with	1
us.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
state	1
he	1
was	1
in,	1
all	1
I	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
be	1
with	1
him,"	1
she	1
said,	1
trembling,	1
and	1
breathing	1
quickly.	1
	1
And	1
not	1
letting	1
them	1
interrupt	1
her	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
mentioned	1
to	1
anyone--all	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
during	1
those	1
three	1
weeks	1
of	1
their	1
journey	1
and	1
life	1
at	1
Yaroslavl.	1
	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
lips	1
parted	1
and	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her	1
full	1
of	1
tears.	1
As	1
he	1
listened	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
nor	1
of	1
death,	1
nor	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
telling.	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
felt	1
only	1
pity	1
for	1
her,	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
suffering	1
now	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
speaking.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
frowning	1
in	1
her	1
effort	1
to	1
hold	1
back	1
her	1
tears,	1
sat	1
beside	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
heard	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
those	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
and	1
Natasha's	1
love.	1
	1
Evidently	1
Natasha	1
needed	1
to	1
tell	1
that	1
painful	1
yet	1
joyful	1
tale.	1
	1
She	1
spoke,	1
mingling	1
most	1
trifling	1
details	1
with	1
the	1
intimate	1
secrets	1
of	1
her	1
soul,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
finish.	1
Several	1
times	1
she	1
repeated	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
twice.	1
	1
Dessalles'	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
asking	1
whether	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
might	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
night.	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
all--everything,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
quickly	1
just	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
entered,	1
almost	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
was	1
hidden	1
by	1
curtains,	1
struck	1
her	1
head	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
moan	1
either	1
of	1
pain	1
or	1
sorrow.	1
	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
through	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
disappeared	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
all	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
roused	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
abstraction	1
by	1
drawing	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
nephew	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
of	1
emotional	1
tenderness	1
young	1
Nicholas'	1
face,	1
which	1
resembled	1
his	1
father's,	1
affected	1
Pierre	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
kissed	1
the	1
boy	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
quickly,	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
"No,	1
Natasha	1
and	1
I	1
sometimes	1
don't	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
till	1
after	1
two,	1
so	1
please	1
don't	1
go.	1
I	1
will	1
order	1
supper.	1
Go	1
downstairs,	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
immediately."	1
	1
Before	1
Pierre	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
told	1
him:	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
she	1
has	1
talked	1
of	1
him	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
large,	1
brightly	1
lit	1
dining	1
room;	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
he	1
heard	1
footsteps	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
entered	1
with	1
Natasha.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
calm,	1
though	1
a	1
severe	1
and	1
grave	1
expression	1
had	1
again	1
settled	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
They	1
all	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
now	1
experienced	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
awkwardness	1
which	1
usually	1
follows	1
after	1
a	1
serious	1
and	1
heartfelt	1
talk.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
conversation,	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
trifles	1
is	1
awkward,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
speak	1
is	1
there	1
and	1
silence	1
seems	1
like	1
affectation.	1
They	1
went	1
silently	1
to	1
table.	1
The	1
footmen	1
drew	1
back	1
the	1
chairs	1
and	1
pushed	1
them	1
up	1
again.	1
Pierre	1
unfolded	1
his	1
cold	1
table	1
napkin	1
and,	1
resolving	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
silence,	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha	1
and	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
They	1
had	1
evidently	1
both	1
formed	1
the	1
same	1
resolution;	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
both	1
shone	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
a	1
confession	1
that	1
besides	1
sorrow	1
life	1
also	1
has	1
joy.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
take	1
vodka,	1
Count?"	1
asked	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
those	1
words	1
suddenly	1
banished	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
"Now	1
tell	1
us	1
about	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"One	1
hears	1
such	1
improbable	1
wonders	1
about	1
you."	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Pierre	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
mild	1
irony	1
now	1
habitual	1
to	1
him.	1
"They	1
even	1
tell	1
me	1
wonders	1
I	1
myself	1
never	1
dreamed	1
of!	1
Mary	1
Abramovna	1
invited	1
me	1
to	1
her	1
house	1
and	1
kept	1
telling	1
me	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
or	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
happened,	1
to	1
me.	1
Stepan	1
Stepanych	1
also	1
instructed	1
me	1
how	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
my	1
experiences.	1
In	1
general	1
I	1
have	1
noticed	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
interesting	1
man	1
(I	1
am	1
an	1
interesting	1
man	1
now);	1
people	1
invite	1
me	1
out	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
myself."	1
	1
Natasha	1
smiled	1
and	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
speaking.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
been	1
told,"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
interrupted	1
her,	1
"that	1
you	1
lost	1
two	1
millions	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Is	1
that	1
true?"	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
before,"	1
returned	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Though	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
now	1
altered	1
by	1
his	1
decision	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
wife's	1
debts	1
and	1
to	1
rebuild	1
his	1
houses,	1
Pierre	1
still	1
maintained	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
"What	1
I	1
have	1
certainly	1
gained	1
is	1
freedom,"	1
he	1
began	1
seriously,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
continue,	1
noticing	1
that	1
this	1
theme	1
was	1
too	1
egotistic.	1
	1
"And	1
are	1
you	1
building?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
Savelich	1
says	1
I	1
must!"	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
death	1
when	1
you	1
decided	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
asked	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
immediately	1
blushed,	1
noticing	1
that	1
her	1
question,	1
following	1
his	1
mention	1
of	1
freedom,	1
ascribed	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
a	1
meaning	1
he	1
had	1
perhaps	1
not	1
intended.	1
	1
"No,"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
evidently	1
not	1
considering	1
awkward	1
the	1
meaning	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
his	1
words.	1
"I	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
Orel	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
how	1
it	1
shocked	1
me.	1
We	1
were	1
not	1
an	1
exemplary	1
couple,"	1
he	1
added	1
quickly,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Natasha	1
and	1
noticing	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
"but	1
her	1
death	1
shocked	1
me	1
terribly.	1
When	1
two	1
people	1
quarrel	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
both	1
in	1
fault,	1
and	1
one's	1
own	1
guilt	1
suddenly	1
becomes	1
terribly	1
serious	1
when	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
alive.	1
And	1
then	1
such	1
a	1
death...	1
without	1
friends	1
and	1
without	1
consolation!	1
I	1
am	1
very,	1
very	1
sorry	1
for	1
her,"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
and	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
notice	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
glad	1
approval	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
face.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
once	1
more	1
an	1
eligible	1
bachelor,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
flushed	1
crimson	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
When	1
he	1
ventured	1
to	1
glance	1
her	1
way	1
again	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
cold,	1
stern,	1
and	1
he	1
fancied	1
even	1
contemptuous.	1
	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
really	1
see	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
told?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Pierre	1
laughed.	1
	1
"No,	1
not	1
once!	1
Everybody	1
seems	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
being	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
means	1
being	1
Napoleon's	1
guest.	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
I	1
never	1
see	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
heard	1
nothing	1
about	1
him--I	1
was	1
in	1
much	1
lower	1
company!"	1
	1
Supper	1
was	1
over,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
who	1
at	1
first	1
declined	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
his	1
captivity	1
was	1
gradually	1
led	1
on	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
"But	1
it's	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
to	1
kill	1
Napoleon?"	1
Natasha	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile.	1
"I	1
guessed	1
it	1
then	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
tower,	1
do	1
you	1
remember?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
admitted	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
was	1
gradually	1
led	1
by	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
questions	1
and	1
especially	1
by	1
Natasha's	1
into	1
giving	1
a	1
detailed	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
adventures.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
the	1
amused	1
and	1
mild	1
irony	1
now	1
customary	1
with	1
him	1
toward	1
everybody	1
and	1
especially	1
toward	1
himself,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
horrors	1
and	1
sufferings	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
he	1
was	1
unconsciously	1
carried	1
away	1
and	1
began	1
speaking	1
with	1
the	1
suppressed	1
emotion	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
re-experiencing	1
in	1
recollection	1
strong	1
impressions	1
he	1
has	1
lived	1
through.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
smile	1
looked	1
now	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
In	1
the	1
whole	1
narrative	1
she	1
saw	1
only	1
Pierre	1
and	1
his	1
goodness.	1
Natasha,	1
leaning	1
on	1
her	1
elbow,	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
constantly	1
changing	1
with	1
the	1
narrative,	1
watched	1
Pierre	1
with	1
an	1
attention	1
that	1
never	1
wandered--evidently	1
herself	1
experiencing	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
described.	1
Not	1
only	1
her	1
look,	1
but	1
her	1
exclamations	1
and	1
the	1
brief	1
questions	1
she	1
put,	1
showed	1
Pierre	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
convey.	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
not	1
only	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
also	1
what	1
he	1
wished	1
to,	1
but	1
could	1
not,	1
express	1
in	1
words.	1
The	1
account	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
of	1
the	1
incident	1
with	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
for	1
protecting	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
arrested	1
was	1
this:	1
"It	1
was	1
an	1
awful	1
sight--children	1
abandoned,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
flames...	1
One	1
was	1
snatched	1
out	1
before	1
my	1
eyes...	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
women	1
who	1
had	1
their	1
things	1
snatched	1
off	1
and	1
their	1
earrings	1
torn	1
out..."	1
he	1
flushed	1
and	1
grew	1
confused.	1
"Then	1
a	1
patrol	1
arrived	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men--all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
looting,	1
that	1
is--were	1
arrested,	1
and	1
I	1
among	1
them."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
you're	1
not	1
telling	1
us	1
everything;	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
did	1
something..."	1
said	1
Natasha	1
and	1
pausing	1
added,	1
"something	1
fine?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
continued.	1
When	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
execution	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
horrible	1
details,	1
but	1
Natasha	1
insisted	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
omit	1
anything.	1
	1
Pierre	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
about	1
Karataev,	1
but	1
paused.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
was	1
pacing	1
the	1
room,	1
Natasha	1
following	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
he	1
added:	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
can't	1
understand	1
what	1
I	1
learned	1
from	1
that	1
illiterate	1
man--that	1
simple	1
fellow."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
go	1
on!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"They	1
killed	1
him	1
almost	1
before	1
my	1
eyes."	1
	1
And	1
Pierre,	1
his	1
voice	1
trembling	1
continually,	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
retreat,	1
of	1
Karataev's	1
illness	1
and	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
He	1
told	1
of	1
his	1
adventures	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
recalled	1
them.	1
He	1
now,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
saw	1
a	1
new	1
meaning	1
in	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
through.	1
Now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
telling	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
Natasha	1
he	1
experienced	1
that	1
pleasure	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
when	1
women	1
listen	1
to	1
him--not	1
clever	1
women	1
who	1
when	1
listening	1
either	1
try	1
to	1
remember	1
what	1
they	1
hear	1
to	1
enrich	1
their	1
minds	1
and	1
when	1
opportunity	1
offers	1
to	1
retell	1
it,	1
or	1
who	1
wish	1
to	1
adopt	1
it	1
to	1
some	1
thought	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
and	1
promptly	1
contribute	1
their	1
own	1
clever	1
comments	1
prepared	1
in	1
their	1
little	1
mental	1
workshop--but	1
the	1
pleasure	1
given	1
by	1
real	1
women	1
gifted	1
with	1
a	1
capacity	1
to	1
select	1
and	1
absorb	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
a	1
man	1
shows	1
of	1
himself.	1
Natasha	1
without	1
knowing	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
attention:	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
a	1
word,	1
no	1
single	1
quiver	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
voice,	1
no	1
look,	1
no	1
twitch	1
of	1
a	1
muscle	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
nor	1
a	1
single	1
gesture.	1
She	1
caught	1
the	1
unfinished	1
word	1
in	1
its	1
flight	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
straight	1
into	1
her	1
open	1
heart,	1
divining	1
the	1
secret	1
meaning	1
of	1
all	1
Pierre's	1
mental	1
travail.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
understood	1
his	1
story	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
she	1
now	1
saw	1
something	1
else	1
that	1
absorbed	1
all	1
her	1
attention.	1
She	1
saw	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
happiness	1
between	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
filled	1
her	1
heart	1
with	1
gladness.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
three	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
The	1
footmen	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
sad	1
and	1
stern	1
faces	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
candles,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
noticed	1
them.	1
	1
Pierre	1
finished	1
his	1
story.	1
Natasha	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
intently	1
with	1
bright,	1
attentive,	1
and	1
animated	1
eyes,	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
something	1
more	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
perhaps	1
left	1
untold.	1
Pierre	1
in	1
shamefaced	1
and	1
happy	1
confusion	1
glanced	1
occasionally	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
next	1
to	1
introduce	1
a	1
fresh	1
subject.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
silent.	1
It	1
occurred	1
to	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
three	1
o'clock	1
and	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed.	1
	1
"People	1
speak	1
of	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
sufferings,"	1
remarked	1
Pierre,	1
"but	1
if	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
I	1
were	1
asked:	1
'Would	1
you	1
rather	1
be	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
before	1
you	1
were	1
taken	1
prisoner,	1
or	1
go	1
through	1
all	1
this	1
again?'	1
then	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
let	1
me	1
again	1
have	1
captivity	1
and	1
horseflesh!	1
We	1
imagine	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
usual	1
ruts	1
all	1
is	1
lost,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
then	1
that	1
what	1
is	1
new	1
and	1
good	1
begins.	1
While	1
there	1
is	1
life	1
there	1
is	1
happiness.	1
There	1
is	1
much,	1
much	1
before	1
us.	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
you,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
she	1
said,	1
answering	1
something	1
quite	1
different.	1
"I	1
too	1
should	1
wish	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
relive	1
it	1
all	1
from	1
the	1
beginning."	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
nothing	1
more,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
true,	1
not	1
true!"	1
cried	1
Pierre.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
being	1
alive	1
and	1
wishing	1
to	1
live--nor	1
you	1
either."	1
	1
Suddenly	1
Natasha	1
bent	1
her	1
head,	1
covered	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
Natasha?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Nothing,	1
nothing."	1
She	1
smiled	1
at	1
Pierre	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
"Good	1
night!	1
It	1
is	1
time	1
for	1
bed."	1
	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
leave.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
met	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
They	1
talked	1
of	1
what	1
Pierre	1
had	1
told	1
them.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
Pierre	1
nor	1
did	1
Natasha	1
speak	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
good	1
night,	1
Mary!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
am	1
often	1
afraid	1
that	1
by	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
him"	1
(she	1
meant	1
Prince	1
Andrew)	1
"for	1
fear	1
of	1
not	1
doing	1
justice	1
to	1
our	1
feelings,	1
we	1
forget	1
him."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
and	1
thereby	1
acknowledged	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
remark,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
agreement	1
in	1
words.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
forget?"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"It	1
did	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
to	1
tell	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
today.	1
It	1
was	1
hard	1
and	1
painful,	1
but	1
good,	1
very	1
good!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
he	1
really	1
loved	1
him.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
told	1
him...	1
Was	1
it	1
all	1
right?"	1
she	1
added,	1
suddenly	1
blushing.	1
	1
"To	1
tell	1
Pierre?	1
Oh,	1
yes.	1
What	1
a	1
splendid	1
man	1
he	1
is!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Mary..."	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
mischievous	1
smile	1
such	1
as	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
"he	1
has	1
somehow	1
grown	1
so	1
clean,	1
smooth,	1
and	1
fresh--as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
Russian	1
bath;	1
do	1
you	1
understand?	1
Out	1
of	1
a	1
moral	1
bath.	1
Isn't	1
it	1
true?"	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"He	1
has	1
greatly	1
improved."	1
	1
"With	1
a	1
short	1
coat	1
and	1
his	1
hair	1
cropped;	1
just	1
as	1
if,	1
well,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1
bath...	1
Papa	1
used	1
to..."	1
	1
"I	1
understand	1
why	1
he"	1
(Prince	1
Andrew)	1
"liked	1
no	1
one	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
him,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
different.	1
They	1
say	1
men	1
are	1
friends	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
quite	1
different.	1
That	1
must	1
be	1
true.	1
Really	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
unlike	1
him--	1
in	1
everything."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
he's	1
wonderful."	1
	1
"Well,	1
good	1
night,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
mischievous	1
smile	1
lingered	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
there.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
Pierre	1
could	1
fall	1
asleep	1
that	1
night.	1
He	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
room,	1
now	1
turning	1
his	1
thoughts	1
on	1
a	1
difficult	1
problem	1
and	1
frowning,	1
now	1
suddenly	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
wincing,	1
and	1
now	1
smiling	1
happily.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
of	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
love,	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
jealous	1
of	1
her	1
past,	1
then	1
reproaching	1
himself	1
for	1
that	1
feeling.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
six	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
he	1
still	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what's	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
if	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
avoided?	1
What's	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
Evidently	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
so,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
hastily	1
undressing	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
bed,	1
happy	1
and	1
agitated	1
but	1
free	1
from	1
hesitation	1
or	1
indecision.	1
	1
"Strange	1
and	1
impossible	1
as	1
such	1
happiness	1
seems,	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
everything	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
man	1
and	1
wife,"	1
he	1
told	1
himself.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
previously	1
Pierre	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
the	1
Friday.	1
When	1
he	1
awoke	1
on	1
the	1
Thursday,	1
Savelich	1
came	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
about	1
packing	1
for	1
the	1
journey.	1
	1
"What,	1
to	1
Petersburg?	1
What	1
is	1
Petersburg?	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
Petersburg?"	1
he	1
asked	1
involuntarily,	1
though	1
only	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
long	1
ago	1
before	1
this	1
happened	1
I	1
did	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
mean	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg,"	1
he	1
reflected.	1
"Why?	1
But	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
go.	1
What	1
a	1
good	1
fellow	1
he	1
is	1
and	1
how	1
attentive,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
remembers	1
everything,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
looking	1
at	1
Savelich's	1
old	1
face,	1
"and	1
what	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
he	1
has!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
Savelich,	1
do	1
you	1
still	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
accept	1
your	1
freedom?"	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
him.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
freedom	1
to	1
me,	1
your	1
excellency?	1
We	1
lived	1
under	1
the	1
late	1
count--the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
be	1
his!--and	1
we	1
have	1
lived	1
under	1
you	1
too,	1
without	1
ever	1
being	1
wronged."	1
	1
"And	1
your	1
children?"	1
	1
"The	1
children	1
will	1
live	1
just	1
the	1
same.	1
With	1
such	1
masters	1
one	1
can	1
live."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
about	1
my	1
heirs?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Supposing	1
I	1
suddenly	1
marry...	1
it	1
might	1
happen,"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
an	1
involuntary	1
smile.	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
the	1
liberty,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing."	1
	1
"How	1
easy	1
he	1
thinks	1
it,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"He	1
doesn't	1
know	1
how	1
terrible	1
it	1
is	1
and	1
how	1
dangerous.	1
Too	1
soon	1
or	1
too	1
late...	1
it	1
is	1
terrible!"	1
	1
"So	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
orders?	1
Are	1
you	1
starting	1
tomorrow?"	1
asked	1
Savelich.	1
	1
"No,	1
I'll	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
for	1
a	1
bit.	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
later.	1
You	1
must	1
forgive	1
the	1
trouble	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
you	1
to,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
seeing	1
Savelich	1
smile,	1
he	1
thought:	1
"But	1
how	1
strange	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
now	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
Petersburg	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
settled	1
first	1
of	1
all!	1
But	1
probably	1
he	1
knows	1
it	1
well	1
enough	1
and	1
is	1
only	1
pretending.	1
Shall	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
thinks?"	1
Pierre	1
reflected.	1
"No,	1
another	1
time."	1
	1
At	1
breakfast	1
Pierre	1
told	1
the	1
princess,	1
his	1
cousin,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
there	1
met--"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
Natasha	1
Rostova!"	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
nothing	1
more	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
that	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Anna	1
Semenovna.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
her?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
princess,"	1
she	1
replied.	1
"I	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
arranging	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
young	1
Rostov.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
they	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
utterly	1
ruined."	1
	1
"No;	1
I	1
mean	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
Natasha	1
Rostova?"	1
	1
"I	1
heard	1
about	1
that	1
affair	1
of	1
hers	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
pity."	1
	1
"No,	1
she	1
either	1
doesn't	1
understand	1
or	1
is	1
pretending,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"Better	1
not	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
her	1
either."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
too	1
had	1
prepared	1
provisions	1
for	1
Pierre's	1
journey.	1
	1
"How	1
kind	1
they	1
all	1
are,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"What	1
is	1
surprising	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
trouble	1
about	1
these	1
things	1
now	1
when	1
it	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
them.	1
And	1
all	1
for	1
me!"	1
	1
On	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
the	1
Chief	1
of	1
Police	1
came	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
inviting	1
him	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
representative	1
to	1
the	1
Faceted	1
Palace	1
to	1
recover	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
owners	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
"And	1
this	1
man	1
too,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
of	1
Police.	1
"What	1
a	1
fine,	1
good-looking	1
officer	1
and	1
how	1
kind.	1
Fancy	1
bothering	1
about	1
such	1
trifles	1
now!	1
And	1
they	1
actually	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
honest	1
and	1
takes	1
bribes.	1
What	1
nonsense!	1
Besides,	1
why	1
shouldn't	1
he	1
take	1
bribes?	1
That's	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
up,	1
and	1
everybody	1
does	1
it.	1
But	1
what	1
a	1
kind,	1
pleasant	1
face	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
smiles	1
as	1
he	1
looks	1
at	1
me."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
past	1
the	1
houses	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
burned	1
down,	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
by	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
those	1
ruins.	1
The	1
picturesqueness	1
of	1
the	1
chimney	1
stacks	1
and	1
tumble-down	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
burned-out	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
stretching	1
out	1
and	1
concealing	1
one	1
another,	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine	1
and	1
the	1
Colosseum.	1
The	1
cabmen	1
he	1
met	1
and	1
their	1
passengers,	1
the	1
carpenters	1
cutting	1
the	1
timber	1
for	1
new	1
houses	1
with	1
axes,	1
the	1
women	1
hawkers,	1
and	1
the	1
shopkeepers,	1
all	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
cheerful	1
beaming	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"Ah,	1
there	1
he	1
is!	1
Let's	1
see	1
what	1
will	1
come	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
At	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
house	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
really	1
been	1
there	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
and	1
really	1
seen	1
Natasha	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
her.	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
imagined	1
it;	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
find	1
no	1
one	1
there."	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
he	1
felt	1
her	1
presence	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
being	1
by	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
freedom.	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
black	1
dress	1
with	1
soft	1
folds	1
and	1
her	1
hair	1
was	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
yet	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
different.	1
Had	1
she	1
been	1
like	1
this	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
recognize	1
her.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
almost	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
later	1
on	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
fiancee.	1
A	1
bright	1
questioning	1
light	1
shone	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
a	1
friendly	1
and	1
strangely	1
roguish	1
expression.	1
	1
Pierre	1
dined	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
there,	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
vespers	1
and	1
Pierre	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
he	1
came	1
early,	1
dined,	1
and	1
stayed	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
Though	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
evidently	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
visitor	1
and	1
though	1
all	1
Pierre's	1
interest	1
was	1
now	1
centered	1
in	1
that	1
house,	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
they	1
had	1
talked	1
over	1
everything	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
passed	1
from	1
one	1
trivial	1
topic	1
to	1
another	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
broke	1
off.	1
He	1
stayed	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
exchanged	1
glances,	1
evidently	1
wondering	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
go.	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
this	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
go.	1
He	1
felt	1
uneasy	1
and	1
embarrassed,	1
but	1
sat	1
on	1
because	1
he	1
simply	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
take	1
his	1
leave.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
foreseeing	1
no	1
end	1
to	1
this,	1
rose	1
first,	1
and	1
complaining	1
of	1
a	1
headache	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
night.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
tomorrow?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going,"	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
hastily,	1
in	1
a	1
surprised	1
tone	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
offended.	1
"Yes...	1
no...	1
to	1
Petersburg?	1
Tomorrow--but	1
I	1
won't	1
say	1
good-by	1
yet.	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
round	1
in	1
case	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
commissions	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
he,	1
standing	1
before	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
turning	1
red,	1
but	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
departure.	1
	1
Natasha	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
away	1
sank	1
into	1
an	1
armchair,	1
and	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
deep,	1
radiant	1
eyes.	1
The	1
weariness	1
she	1
had	1
plainly	1
shown	1
before	1
had	1
now	1
quite	1
passed	1
off.	1
With	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
long-	1
drawn	1
sigh	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
a	1
lengthy	1
talk.	1
	1
When	1
Natasha	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
Pierre's	1
confusion	1
and	1
awkwardness	1
immediately	1
vanished	1
and	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
eager	1
excitement.	1
He	1
quickly	1
moved	1
an	1
armchair	1
toward	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you,"	1
said	1
he,	1
answering	1
her	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
spoken.	1
"Princess,	1
help	1
me!	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?	1
Can	1
I	1
hope?	1
Princess,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
listen!	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
all.	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
her,	1
I	1
know	1
it's	1
impossible	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
now.	1
But	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
brother	1
to	1
her.	1
No,	1
not	1
that,	1
I	1
don't,	1
I	1
can't..."	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
"Well,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
an	1
evident	1
effort	1
at	1
self-control	1
and	1
coherence.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
love	1
her,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
alone	1
all	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
life	1
without	1
her.	1
I	1
cannot	1
propose	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
present,	1
but	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
she	1
might	1
someday	1
be	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
missing	1
that	1
possibility...	1
that	1
possibility...	1
is	1
terrible.	1
Tell	1
me,	1
can	1
I	1
hope?	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
do,	1
dear	1
princess!"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
and	1
touched	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me,"	1
answered	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
say.	1
You	1
are	1
right	1
that	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
love	1
at	1
present..."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
stopped.	1
She	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
love	1
was	1
impossible,	1
but	1
she	1
stopped	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
sudden	1
change	1
in	1
Natasha	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
not	1
be	1
hurt	1
if	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
of	1
his	1
love,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
she	1
wished	1
for.	1
	1
"To	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
wouldn't	1
do,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?"	1
	1
"Leave	1
it	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"I	1
know..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
looking	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Well?...	1
Well?..."	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
loves...	1
will	1
love	1
you,"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
corrected	1
herself.	1
	1
Before	1
her	1
words	1
were	1
out,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
expression	1
seized	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
hand.	1
	1
"What	1
makes	1
you	1
think	1
so?	1
You	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
hope?	1
You	1
think...?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
think	1
so,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Write	1
to	1
her	1
parents,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
her	1
when	1
I	1
can.	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
to	1
happen	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
tells	1
me	1
it	1
will."	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be!	1
How	1
happy	1
I	1
am!	1
But	1
it	1
can't	1
be....	1
How	1
happy	1
I	1
am!	1
No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!"	1
Pierre	1
kept	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
kissed	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
hands.	1
	1
"Go	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
best.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
to	1
you,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"To	1
Petersburg?	1
Go	1
there?	1
Very	1
well,	1
I'll	1
go.	1
But	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
again	1
tomorrow?"	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Pierre	1
came	1
to	1
say	1
good-by.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
less	1
animated	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
day	1
before;	1
but	1
that	1
day	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
Pierre	1
sometimes	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
vanishing	1
and	1
that	1
neither	1
he	1
nor	1
she	1
existed	1
any	1
longer,	1
that	1
nothing	1
existed	1
but	1
happiness.	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible?	1
No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be,"	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
at	1
every	1
look,	1
gesture,	1
and	1
word	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
soul	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
When	1
on	1
saying	1
good-by	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
thin,	1
slender	1
hand,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
holding	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
in	1
his	1
own.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
this	1
hand,	1
that	1
face,	1
those	1
eyes,	1
all	1
this	1
treasure	1
of	1
feminine	1
charm	1
so	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
now,	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
one	1
day	1
be	1
mine	1
forever,	1
as	1
familiar	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
myself?...	1
No,	1
that's	1
impossible!..."	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
Count,"	1
she	1
said	1
aloud.	1
"I	1
shall	1
look	1
forward	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
your	1
return,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
And	1
these	1
simple	1
words,	1
her	1
look,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
which	1
accompanied	1
them,	1
formed	1
for	1
two	1
months	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
inexhaustible	1
memories,	1
interpretations,	1
and	1
happy	1
meditations	1
for	1
Pierre.	1
"'I	1
shall	1
look	1
forward	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
your	1
return....'	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
how	1
did	1
she	1
say	1
it?	1
Yes,	1
'I	1
shall	1
look	1
forward	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
your	1
return.'	1
Oh,	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
am!	1
What	1
is	1
happening	1
to	1
me?	1
How	1
happy	1
I	1
am!"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
soul	1
now	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
what	1
had	1
troubled	1
it	1
during	1
his	1
courtship	1
of	1
Helene.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
repeat	1
to	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
sickening	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
spoken,	1
or	1
say:	1
"Oh,	1
why	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
say	1
that?"	1
and,	1
"Whatever	1
made	1
me	1
say	1
'Je	1
vous	1
aime'?"	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
now	1
repeated	1
in	1
imagination	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
he	1
or	1
Natasha	1
had	1
spoken	1
and	1
pictured	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
smile,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
diminish	1
or	1
add	1
anything,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
repeat	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again.	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
doubt	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
undertaken	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong.	1
Only	1
one	1
terrible	1
doubt	1
sometimes	1
crossed	1
his	1
mind:	1
"Wasn't	1
it	1
all	1
a	1
dream?	1
Isn't	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
mistaken?	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
too	1
conceited	1
and	1
self-	1
confident?	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
this--and	1
suddenly	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
will	1
tell	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
smile	1
and	1
say:	1
'How	1
strange!	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
deluding	1
himself.	1
Doesn't	1
he	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man,	1
just	1
a	1
man,	1
while	1
I...?	1
I	1
am	1
something	1
altogether	1
different	1
and	1
higher.'"	1
	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
doubt	1
often	1
troubling	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
make	1
any	1
plans.	1
The	1
happiness	1
before	1
him	1
appeared	1
so	1
inconceivable	1
that	1
if	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
attain	1
it,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
things.	1
Everything	1
ended	1
with	1
that.	1
	1
A	1
joyful,	1
unexpected	1
frenzy,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
himself	1
incapable,	1
possessed	1
him.	1
The	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
life--not	1
for	1
him	1
alone	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
world--seemed	1
to	1
him	1
centered	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
being	1
loved	1
by	1
her.	1
At	1
times	1
everybody	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
occupied	1
with	1
one	1
thing	1
only--his	1
future	1
happiness.	1
Sometimes	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
other	1
people	1
were	1
all	1
as	1
pleased	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
and	1
merely	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
that	1
pleasure	1
by	1
pretending	1
to	1
be	1
busy	1
with	1
other	1
interests.	1
In	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
gesture	1
he	1
saw	1
allusions	1
to	1
his	1
happiness.	1
He	1
often	1
surprised	1
those	1
he	1
met	1
by	1
his	1
significantly	1
happy	1
looks	1
and	1
smiles	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
express	1
a	1
secret	1
understanding	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
people	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
happiness,	1
he	1
pitied	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
heart	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
desire	1
somehow	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
occupied	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
frivolous	1
trifle	1
unworthy	1
of	1
attention.	1
	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
enter	1
the	1
civil	1
service,	1
or	1
when	1
the	1
war	1
or	1
any	1
general	1
political	1
affairs	1
were	1
discussed	1
on	1
the	1
assumption	1
that	1
everybody's	1
welfare	1
depended	1
on	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
issue	1
of	1
events,	1
he	1
would	1
listen	1
with	1
a	1
mild	1
and	1
pitying	1
smile	1
and	1
surprise	1
people	1
by	1
his	1
strange	1
comments.	1
But	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
saw	1
everybody--both	1
those	1
who,	1
as	1
he	1
imagined,	1
understood	1
the	1
real	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
(that	1
is,	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
feeling)	1
and	1
those	1
unfortunates	1
who	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
it--in	1
the	1
bright	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
emotion	1
that	1
shone	1
within	1
himself,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
any	1
effort	1
saw	1
in	1
everyone	1
he	1
met	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
loved.	1
	1
When	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
affairs	1
and	1
papers	1
of	1
his	1
dead	1
wife,	1
her	1
memory	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
no	1
feeling	1
but	1
pity	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
bliss	1
he	1
now	1
knew.	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
having	1
obtained	1
a	1
new	1
post	1
and	1
some	1
fresh	1
decorations	1
was	1
particularly	1
proud	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
pathetic,	1
kindly	1
old	1
man	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied.	1
	1
Often	1
in	1
afterlife	1
Pierre	1
recalled	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
blissful	1
insanity.	1
All	1
the	1
views	1
he	1
formed	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
circumstances	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
remained	1
true	1
for	1
him	1
always.	1
He	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
not	1
renounce	1
them	1
subsequently,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
or	1
inwardly	1
at	1
variance,	1
he	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
he	1
had	1
held	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
madness	1
and	1
they	1
always	1
proved	1
correct.	1
	1
"I	1
may	1
have	1
appeared	1
strange	1
and	1
queer	1
then,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"but	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
mad	1
as	1
I	1
seemed.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
wiser	1
and	1
had	1
more	1
insight	1
than	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
time,	1
and	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
worth	1
understanding	1
in	1
life,	1
because...	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
happy."	1
	1
Pierre's	1
insanity	1
consisted	1
in	1
not	1
waiting,	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
do,	1
to	1
discover	1
personal	1
attributes	1
which	1
he	1
termed	1
"good	1
qualities"	1
in	1
people	1
before	1
loving	1
them;	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
now	1
overflowing	1
with	1
love,	1
and	1
by	1
loving	1
people	1
without	1
cause	1
he	1
discovered	1
indubitable	1
causes	1
for	1
loving	1
them.	1

CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
After	1
Pierre's	1
departure	1
that	1
first	1
evening,	1
when	1
Natasha	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
gaily	1
mocking	1
smile:	1
"He	1
looks	1
just,	1
yes,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
Russian	1
bath--in	1
a	1
short	1
coat	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hair	1
cropped,"	1
something	1
hidden	1
and	1
unknown	1
to	1
herself,	1
but	1
irrepressible,	1
awoke	1
in	1
Natasha's	1
soul.	1
	1
Everything:	1
her	1
face,	1
walk,	1
look,	1
and	1
voice,	1
was	1
suddenly	1
altered.	1
To	1
her	1
own	1
surprise	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
hope	1
of	1
happiness	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
demanded	1
satisfaction.	1
From	1
that	1
evening	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
no	1
longer	1
complained	1
of	1
her	1
position,	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
feared	1
to	1
make	1
happy	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
She	1
spoke	1
little	1
of	1
Pierre,	1
but	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
mentioned	1
him	1
a	1
long-extinguished	1
light	1
once	1
more	1
kindled	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
curved	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
smile.	1
	1
	1
The	1
change	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
Natasha	1
at	1
first	1
surprised	1
Princess	1
Mary;	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
understood	1
its	1
meaning	1
it	1
grieved	1
her.	1
"Can	1
she	1
have	1
loved	1
my	1
brother	1
so	1
little	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
forget	1
him	1
so	1
soon?"	1
she	1
thought	1
when	1
she	1
reflected	1
on	1
the	1
change.	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
Natasha	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
vexed	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reproach	1
her.	1
The	1
reawakened	1
power	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
seized	1
Natasha	1
was	1
so	1
evidently	1
irrepressible	1
and	1
unexpected	1
by	1
her	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
reproach	1
her	1
even	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
Natasha	1
gave	1
herself	1
up	1
so	1
fully	1
and	1
frankly	1
to	1
this	1
new	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
sad,	1
but	1
bright	1
and	1
cheerful.	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
after	1
her	1
nocturnal	1
talk	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
Natasha	1
met	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
threshold.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
spoken?	1
Yes?	1
He	1
has	1
spoken?"	1
she	1
repeated.	1
	1
And	1
a	1
joyful	1
yet	1
pathetic	1
expression	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
beg	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
her	1
joy	1
settled	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
face.	1
	1
"I	1
wanted	1
to	1
listen	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
you	1
would	1
tell	1
me."	1
	1
Understandable	1
and	1
touching	1
as	1
the	1
look	1
with	1
which	1
Natasha	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
seemed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
sorry	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
agitation,	1
these	1
words	1
pained	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
She	1
remembered	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
love.	1
	1
"But	1
what's	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
She	1
can't	1
help	1
it,"	1
thought	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
and	1
rather	1
stern	1
look	1
she	1
told	1
Natasha	1
all	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
said.	1
On	1
hearing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
Natasha	1
was	1
astounded.	1
	1
"To	1
Petersburg!"	1
she	1
repeated	1
as	1
if	1
unable	1
to	1
understand.	1
	1
But	1
noticing	1
the	1
grieved	1
expression	1
on	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
face	1
she	1
guessed	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
that	1
sadness	1
and	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Mary,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"tell	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do!	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
bad.	1
Whatever	1
you	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
do.	1
Tell	1
me...."	1
	1
"You	1
love	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
whispered	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Then	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
crying?	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
for	1
your	1
sake,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
because	1
of	1
those	1
tears	1
quite	1
forgave	1
Natasha's	1
joy.	1
	1
"It	1
won't	1
be	1
just	1
yet--someday.	1
Think	1
what	1
fun	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
you	1
marry	1
Nicholas!"	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
that.	1
Let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
you."	1
	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
awhile.	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg?"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
asked,	1
and	1
hastily	1
replied	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
question.	1
"But	1
no,	1
no,	1
he	1
must...	1
Yes,	1
Mary,	1
He	1
must...."	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Seven	1
years	1
had	1
passed.	1
The	1
storm-tossed	1
sea	1
of	1
European	1
history	1
had	1
subsided	1
within	1
its	1
shores	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
become	1
calm.	1
But	1
the	1
mysterious	1
forces	1
that	1
move	1
humanity	1
(mysterious	1
because	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
their	1
motion	1
are	1
unknown	1
to	1
us)	1
continued	1
to	1
operate.	1
	1
Though	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
history	1
seemed	1
motionless,	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
unceasingly	1
as	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
time.	1
Various	1
groups	1
of	1
people	1
formed	1
and	1
dissolved,	1
the	1
coming	1
formation	1
and	1
dissolution	1
of	1
kingdoms	1
and	1
displacement	1
of	1
peoples	1
was	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
preparation.	1
	1
The	1
sea	1
of	1
history	1
was	1
not	1
driven	1
spasmodically	1
from	1
shore	1
to	1
shore	1
as	1
previously.	1
It	1
was	1
seething	1
in	1
its	1
depths.	1
Historic	1
figures	1
were	1
not	1
borne	1
by	1
the	1
waves	1
from	1
one	1
shore	1
to	1
another	1
as	1
before.	1
They	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
rotate	1
on	1
one	1
spot.	1
The	1
historical	1
figures	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
armies,	1
who	1
formerly	1
reflected	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
masses	1
by	1
ordering	1
wars,	1
campaigns,	1
and	1
battles,	1
now	1
reflected	1
the	1
restless	1
movement	1
by	1
political	1
and	1
diplomatic	1
combinations,	1
laws,	1
and	1
treaties.	1
	1
The	1
historians	1
call	1
this	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
historical	1
figures	1
"the	1
reaction."	1
	1
In	1
dealing	1
with	1
this	1
period	1
they	1
sternly	1
condemn	1
the	1
historical	1
personages	1
who,	1
in	1
their	1
opinion,	1
caused	1
what	1
they	1
describe	1
as	1
the	1
reaction.	1
All	1
the	1
well-known	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
period,	1
from	1
Alexander	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
Photius,	1
Schelling,	1
Fichte,	1
Chateaubriand,	1
and	1
the	1
rest,	1
pass	1
before	1
their	1
stern	1
judgment	1
seat	1
and	1
are	1
acquitted	1
or	1
condemned	1
according	1
to	1
whether	1
they	1
conduced	1
to	1
progress	1
or	1
to	1
reaction.	1
	1
According	1
to	1
their	1
accounts	1
a	1
reaction	1
took	1
place	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
in	1
Russia	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
culprit	1
was	1
Alexander	1
I,	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
who	1
according	1
to	1
them	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
liberal	1
movement	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
being	1
the	1
savior	1
of	1
Russia.	1
	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
Russian	1
literature	1
now,	1
from	1
schoolboy	1
essayist	1
to	1
learned	1
historian,	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
throw	1
his	1
little	1
stone	1
at	1
Alexander	1
for	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
wrong	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
	1
"He	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
acted	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
In	1
this	1
case	1
he	1
did	1
well	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
badly.	1
He	1
behaved	1
admirably	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
and	1
during	1
1812,	1
but	1
acted	1
badly	1
by	1
giving	1
a	1
constitution	1
to	1
Poland,	1
forming	1
the	1
Holy	1
Alliance,	1
entrusting	1
power	1
to	1
Arakcheev,	1
favoring	1
Golitsyn	1
and	1
mysticism,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
Shishkov	1
and	1
Photius.	1
He	1
also	1
acted	1
badly	1
by	1
concerning	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
active	1
army	1
and	1
disbanding	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment."	1
	1
It	1
would	1
take	1
a	1
dozen	1
pages	1
to	1
enumerate	1
all	1
the	1
reproaches	1
the	1
historians	1
address	1
to	1
him,	1
based	1
on	1
their	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
humanity.	1
	1
What	1
do	1
these	1
reproaches	1
mean?	1
	1
Do	1
not	1
the	1
very	1
actions	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
historians	1
praise	1
Alexander	1
I	1
(the	1
liberal	1
attempts	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
his	1
struggle	1
with	1
Napoleon,	1
the	1
firmness	1
he	1
displayed	1
in	1
1812	1
and	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1813)	1
flow	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
sources--the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
birth,	1
education,	1
and	1
life--that	1
made	1
his	1
personality	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
actions	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
blame	1
him	1
(the	1
Holy	1
Alliance,	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
Poland,	1
and	1
the	1
reaction	1
of	1
1820	1
and	1
later)	1
also	1
flowed?	1
	1
In	1
what	1
does	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
those	1
reproaches	1
lie?	1
	1
It	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
an	1
historic	1
character	1
like	1
Alexander	1
I,	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
highest	1
possible	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
human	1
power	1
with	1
the	1
blinding	1
light	1
of	1
history	1
focused	1
upon	1
him;	1
a	1
character	1
exposed	1
to	1
those	1
strongest	1
of	1
all	1
influences:	1
the	1
intrigues,	1
flattery,	1
and	1
self-deception	1
inseparable	1
from	1
power;	1
a	1
character	1
who	1
at	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
felt	1
a	1
responsibility	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
Europe;	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
fictitious	1
but	1
a	1
live	1
character	1
who	1
like	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
his	1
personal	1
habits,	1
passions,	1
and	1
impulses	1
toward	1
goodness,	1
beauty,	1
and	1
truth--that	1
this	1
character--though	1
not	1
lacking	1
in	1
virtue	1
(the	1
historians	1
do	1
not	1
accuse	1
him	1
of	1
that)--had	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
humanity	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago	1
as	1
a	1
present-day	1
professor	1
who	1
from	1
his	1
youth	1
upwards	1
has	1
been	1
occupied	1
with	1
learning:	1
that	1
is,	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
lectures	1
and	1
with	1
taking	1
notes	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
assume	1
that	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago	1
Alexander	1
I	1
was	1
mistaken	1
in	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
we	1
must	1
inevitably	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
historian	1
who	1
judges	1
Alexander	1
will	1
also	1
after	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1
some	1
time	1
turn	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
in	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
humanity.	1
This	1
assumption	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
inevitable	1
because,	1
watching	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
history,	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
every	1
year	1
and	1
with	1
each	1
new	1
writer,	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
mankind	1
changes;	1
so	1
that	1
what	1
once	1
seemed	1
good,	1
ten	1
years	1
later	1
seems	1
bad,	1
and	1
vice	1
versa.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
we	1
find	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
quite	1
contradictory	1
views	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
bad	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
history:	1
some	1
people	1
regard	1
giving	1
a	1
constitution	1
to	1
Poland	1
and	1
forming	1
the	1
Holy	1
Alliance	1
as	1
praiseworthy	1
in	1
Alexander,	1
while	1
others	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
blameworthy.	1
	1
The	1
activity	1
of	1
Alexander	1
or	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
cannot	1
be	1
called	1
useful	1
or	1
harmful,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
useful	1
or	1
harmful.	1
If	1
that	1
activity	1
displeases	1
somebody,	1
this	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
his	1
limited	1
understanding	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
good.	1
Whether	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
arms,	1
or	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
other	1
universities,	1
or	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
Poland	1
or	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
Russia,	1
or	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
Europe,	1
or	1
a	1
certain	1
kind	1
of	1
European	1
culture	1
called	1
"progress"	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
I	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
besides	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
every	1
historic	1
character	1
has	1
other	1
more	1
general	1
purposes	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
assume	1
that	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
science	1
can	1
harmonize	1
all	1
contradictions	1
and	1
possesses	1
an	1
unchanging	1
standard	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
bad	1
by	1
which	1
to	1
try	1
historic	1
characters	1
and	1
events;	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
that	1
Alexander	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
everything	1
differently;	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
that	1
with	1
guidance	1
from	1
those	1
who	1
blame	1
him	1
and	1
who	1
profess	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
ultimate	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
arranged	1
matters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
program	1
his	1
present	1
accusers	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
him--of	1
nationality,	1
freedom,	1
equality,	1
and	1
progress	1
(these,	1
I	1
think,	1
cover	1
the	1
ground).	1
Let	1
us	1
assume	1
that	1
this	1
program	1
was	1
possible	1
and	1
had	1
then	1
been	1
formulated,	1
and	1
that	1
Alexander	1
had	1
acted	1
on	1
it.	1
What	1
would	1
then	1
have	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
opposed	1
the	1
tendency	1
that	1
then	1
prevailed	1
in	1
the	1
government--an	1
activity	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
historians	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
beneficent?	1
Their	1
activity	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
existed:	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
life,	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
nothing.	1
	1
If	1
we	1
admit	1
that	1
human	1
life	1
can	1
be	1
ruled	1
by	1
reason,	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
destroyed.	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
If	1
we	1
assume	1
as	1
the	1
historians	1
do	1
that	1
great	1
men	1
lead	1
humanity	1
to	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
certain	1
ends--the	1
greatness	1
of	1
Russia	1
or	1
of	1
France,	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
Europe,	1
the	1
diffusion	1
of	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
general	1
progress,	1
or	1
anything	1
else--then	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
history	1
without	1
introducing	1
the	1
conceptions	1
of	1
chance	1
and	1
genius.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
wars	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
aggrandizement	1
of	1
Russia,	1
that	1
aim	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
accomplished	1
without	1
all	1
the	1
preceding	1
wars	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
invasion.	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
aggrandizement	1
of	1
France,	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
attained	1
without	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
Empire.	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
dissemination	1
of	1
ideas,	1
the	1
printing	1
press	1
could	1
have	1
accomplished	1
that	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
warfare.	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
civilization,	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
ways	1
of	1
diffusing	1
civilization	1
more	1
expedient	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
of	1
human	1
lives.	1
	1
Why	1
did	1
it	1
happen	1
in	1
this	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
way?	1
	1
Because	1
it	1
happened	1
so!	1
"Chance	1
created	1
the	1
situation;	1
genius	1
utilized	1
it,"	1
says	1
history.	1
	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
chance?	1
What	1
is	1
genius?	1
	1
The	1
words	1
chance	1
and	1
genius	1
do	1
not	1
denote	1
any	1
really	1
existing	1
thing	1
and	1
therefore	1
cannot	1
be	1
defined.	1
Those	1
words	1
only	1
denote	1
a	1
certain	1
stage	1
of	1
understanding	1
of	1
phenomena.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
why	1
a	1
certain	1
event	1
occurs;	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
know	1
it;	1
so	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
talk	1
about	1
chance.	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
force	1
producing	1
effects	1
beyond	1
the	1
scope	1
of	1
ordinary	1
human	1
agencies;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
this	1
occurs	1
and	1
I	1
talk	1
of	1
genius.	1
	1
To	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
rams,	1
the	1
ram	1
the	1
herdsman	1
drives	1
each	1
evening	1
into	1
a	1
special	1
enclosure	1
to	1
feed	1
and	1
that	1
becomes	1
twice	1
as	1
fat	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
genius.	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
appear	1
an	1
astonishing	1
conjunction	1
of	1
genius	1
with	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
extraordinary	1
chances	1
that	1
this	1
ram,	1
who	1
instead	1
of	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
general	1
fold	1
every	1
evening	1
goes	1
into	1
a	1
special	1
enclosure	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
oats--that	1
this	1
very	1
ram,	1
swelling	1
with	1
fat,	1
is	1
killed	1
for	1
meat.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
rams	1
need	1
only	1
cease	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
happens	1
to	1
them	1
happens	1
solely	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
their	1
sheepish	1
aims;	1
they	1
need	1
only	1
admit	1
that	1
what	1
happens	1
to	1
them	1
may	1
also	1
have	1
purposes	1
beyond	1
their	1
ken,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
perceive	1
a	1
unity	1
and	1
coherence	1
in	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
ram	1
that	1
was	1
fattened.	1
Even	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
for	1
what	1
purpose	1
they	1
are	1
fattened,	1
they	1
will	1
at	1
least	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
ram	1
did	1
not	1
happen	1
accidentally,	1
and	1
will	1
no	1
longer	1
need	1
the	1
conceptions	1
of	1
chance	1
or	1
genius.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
renouncing	1
our	1
claim	1
to	1
discern	1
a	1
purpose	1
immediately	1
intelligible	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
admitting	1
the	1
ultimate	1
purpose	1
to	1
be	1
beyond	1
our	1
ken,	1
may	1
we	1
discern	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
experiences	1
in	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
historic	1
characters	1
and	1
perceive	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
they	1
produce	1
(incommensurable	1
with	1
ordinary	1
human	1
capabilities),	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
words	1
chance	1
and	1
genius	1
become	1
superfluous.	1
	1
We	1
need	1
only	1
confess	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
convulsions	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
only	1
the	1
facts--that	1
is,	1
the	1
murders,	1
first	1
in	1
France,	1
then	1
in	1
Italy,	1
in	1
Africa,	1
in	1
Prussia,	1
in	1
Austria,	1
in	1
Spain,	1
and	1
in	1
Russia--and	1
that	1
the	1
movements	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
form	1
the	1
essence	1
and	1
purpose	1
of	1
these	1
events,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
shall	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
see	1
exceptional	1
ability	1
and	1
genius	1
in	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
Alexander,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
consider	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
like	1
other	1
men,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
chance	1
for	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
those	1
small	1
events	1
which	1
made	1
these	1
people	1
what	1
they	1
were,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
clear	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
small	1
events	1
were	1
inevitable.	1
	1
By	1
discarding	1
a	1
claim	1
to	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
ultimate	1
purpose,	1
we	1
shall	1
clearly	1
perceive	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
one	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
a	1
blossom	1
or	1
seed	1
for	1
any	1
single	1
plant	1
better	1
suited	1
to	1
it	1
than	1
those	1
it	1
produces,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
two	1
people	1
more	1
completely	1
adapted	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
smallest	1
detail	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
fulfill,	1
than	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
Alexander	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
antecedents.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
The	1
fundamental	1
and	1
essential	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
peoples	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east	1
and	1
afterwards	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west.	1
The	1
commencement	1
of	1
that	1
movement	1
was	1
the	1
movement	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east.	1
For	1
the	1
peoples	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
warlike	1
movement	1
to	1
Moscow	1
it	1
was	1
necessary:	1
(1)	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
form	1
themselves	1
into	1
a	1
military	1
group	1
of	1
a	1
size	1
able	1
to	1
endure	1
a	1
collision	1
with	1
the	1
warlike	1
military	1
group	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
(2)	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
abandon	1
all	1
established	1
traditions	1
and	1
customs,	1
and	1
(3)	1
that	1
during	1
their	1
military	1
movement	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
at	1
their	1
head	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
justify	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
deceptions,	1
robberies,	1
and	1
murders	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
committed	1
during	1
that	1
movement.	1
	1
And	1
beginning	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution	1
the	1
old	1
inadequately	1
large	1
group	1
was	1
destroyed,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
habits	1
and	1
traditions,	1
and	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
a	1
group	1
was	1
formed	1
of	1
larger	1
dimensions	1
with	1
new	1
customs	1
and	1
traditions,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
produced	1
who	1
would	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
movement	1
and	1
bear	1
the	1
responsibility	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
A	1
man	1
without	1
convictions,	1
without	1
habits,	1
without	1
traditions,	1
without	1
a	1
name,	1
and	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
emerges--by	1
what	1
seem	1
the	1
strangest	1
chances--from	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
seething	1
French	1
parties,	1
and	1
without	1
joining	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
borne	1
forward	1
to	1
a	1
prominent	1
position.	1
	1
The	1
ignorance	1
of	1
his	1
colleagues,	1
the	1
weakness	1
and	1
insignificance	1
of	1
his	1
opponents,	1
the	1
frankness	1
of	1
his	1
falsehoods,	1
and	1
the	1
dazzling	1
and	1
self-	1
confident	1
limitations	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
raise	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
army.	1
The	1
brilliant	1
qualities	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
sent	1
to	1
Italy,	1
his	1
opponents'	1
reluctance	1
to	1
fight,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
childish	1
audacity	1
and	1
self-	1
confidence	1
secure	1
him	1
military	1
fame.	1
Innumerable	1
so-called	1
chances	1
accompany	1
him	1
everywhere.	1
The	1
disfavor	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
falls	1
with	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
France	1
turns	1
to	1
his	1
advantage.	1
His	1
attempts	1
to	1
avoid	1
his	1
predestined	1
path	1
are	1
unsuccessful:	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
received	1
into	1
the	1
Russian	1
service,	1
and	1
the	1
appointment	1
he	1
seeks	1
in	1
Turkey	1
comes	1
to	1
nothing.	1
During	1
the	1
war	1
in	1
Italy	1
he	1
is	1
several	1
times	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
destruction	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
is	1
saved	1
in	1
an	1
unexpected	1
manner.	1
Owing	1
to	1
various	1
diplomatic	1
considerations	1
the	1
Russian	1
armies--just	1
those	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
destroyed	1
his	1
prestige--do	1
not	1
appear	1
upon	1
the	1
scene	1
till	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
there.	1
	1
On	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
Italy	1
he	1
finds	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
Paris	1
in	1
a	1
process	1
of	1
dissolution	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
it	1
are	1
inevitably	1
wiped	1
out	1
and	1
destroyed.	1
And	1
by	1
chance	1
an	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
dangerous	1
position	1
presents	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
an	1
aimless	1
and	1
senseless	1
expedition	1
to	1
Africa.	1
Again	1
so-called	1
chance	1
accompanies	1
him.	1
Impregnable	1
Malta	1
surrenders	1
without	1
a	1
shot;	1
his	1
most	1
reckless	1
schemes	1
are	1
crowned	1
with	1
success.	1
The	1
enemy's	1
fleet,	1
which	1
subsequently	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
a	1
single	1
boat	1
pass,	1
allows	1
his	1
entire	1
army	1
to	1
elude	1
it.	1
In	1
Africa	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
outrages	1
are	1
committed	1
against	1
the	1
almost	1
unarmed	1
inhabitants.	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
commit	1
these	1
crimes,	1
especially	1
their	1
leader,	1
assure	1
themselves	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
admirable,	1
this	1
is	1
glory--it	1
resembles	1
Caesar	1
and	1
Alexander	1
the	1
Great	1
and	1
is	1
therefore	1
good.	1
	1
This	1
ideal	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
grandeur--which	1
consists	1
not	1
merely	1
in	1
considering	1
nothing	1
wrong	1
that	1
one	1
does	1
but	1
in	1
priding	1
oneself	1
on	1
every	1
crime	1
one	1
commits,	1
ascribing	1
to	1
it	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
supernatural	1
significance--that	1
ideal,	1
destined	1
to	1
guide	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
associates,	1
had	1
scope	1
for	1
its	1
development	1
in	1
Africa.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
does	1
succeeds.	1
The	1
plague	1
does	1
not	1
touch	1
him.	1
The	1
cruelty	1
of	1
murdering	1
prisoners	1
is	1
not	1
imputed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
fault.	1
His	1
childishly	1
rash,	1
uncalled-for,	1
and	1
ignoble	1
departure	1
from	1
Africa,	1
leaving	1
his	1
comrades	1
in	1
distress,	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
credit,	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fleet	1
twice	1
lets	1
him	1
slip	1
past.	1
When,	1
intoxicated	1
by	1
the	1
crimes	1
he	1
has	1
committed	1
so	1
successfully,	1
he	1
reaches	1
Paris,	1
the	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
republican	1
government,	1
which	1
a	1
year	1
earlier	1
might	1
have	1
ruined	1
him,	1
has	1
reached	1
its	1
extreme	1
limit,	1
and	1
his	1
presence	1
there	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
newcomer	1
free	1
from	1
party	1
entanglements	1
can	1
only	1
serve	1
to	1
exalt	1
him--and	1
though	1
he	1
himself	1
has	1
no	1
plan,	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
ready	1
for	1
his	1
new	1
role.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
plan,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
everything,	1
but	1
the	1
parties	1
snatched	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
demanded	1
his	1
participation.	1
	1
He	1
alone--with	1
his	1
ideal	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
grandeur	1
developed	1
in	1
Italy	1
and	1
Egypt,	1
his	1
insane	1
self-adulation,	1
his	1
boldness	1
in	1
crime	1
and	1
frankness	1
in	1
lying--he	1
alone	1
could	1
justify	1
what	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
He	1
is	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
awaits	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
almost	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
despite	1
his	1
indecision,	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
a	1
plan,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
mistakes,	1
he	1
is	1
drawn	1
into	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
that	1
aims	1
at	1
seizing	1
power	1
and	1
the	1
conspiracy	1
is	1
crowned	1
with	1
success.	1
	1
He	1
is	1
pushed	1
into	1
a	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
In	1
alarm	1
he	1
wishes	1
to	1
flee,	1
considering	1
himself	1
lost.	1
He	1
pretends	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
swoon	1
and	1
says	1
senseless	1
things	1
that	1
should	1
have	1
ruined	1
him.	1
But	1
the	1
once	1
proud	1
and	1
shrewd	1
rulers	1
of	1
France,	1
feeling	1
that	1
their	1
part	1
is	1
played	1
out,	1
are	1
even	1
more	1
bewildered	1
than	1
he,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
the	1
words	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
and	1
retain	1
their	1
power.	1
	1
Chance,	1
millions	1
of	1
chances,	1
give	1
him	1
power,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
agreement	1
co-operate	1
to	1
confirm	1
that	1
power.	1
Chance	1
forms	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
France,	1
who	1
submit	1
to	1
him;	1
chance	1
forms	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
Paul	1
I	1
of	1
Russia	1
who	1
recognizes	1
his	1
government;	1
chance	1
contrives	1
a	1
plot	1
against	1
him	1
which	1
not	1
only	1
fails	1
to	1
harm	1
him	1
but	1
confirms	1
his	1
power.	1
Chance	1
puts	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
causes	1
him	1
to	1
kill	1
him--thereby	1
convincing	1
the	1
mob	1
more	1
forcibly	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
right,	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
might.	1
Chance	1
contrives	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
directs	1
all	1
his	1
efforts	1
to	1
prepare	1
an	1
expedition	1
against	1
England	1
(which	1
would	1
inevitably	1
have	1
ruined	1
him)	1
he	1
never	1
carries	1
out	1
that	1
intention,	1
but	1
unexpectedly	1
falls	1
upon	1
Mack	1
and	1
the	1
Austrians,	1
who	1
surrender	1
without	1
a	1
battle.	1
Chance	1
and	1
genius	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
victory	1
at	1
Austerlitz;	1
and	1
by	1
chance	1
all	1
men,	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
French	1
but	1
all	1
Europe--except	1
England	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
events	1
about	1
to	1
happen--despite	1
their	1
former	1
horror	1
and	1
detestation	1
of	1
his	1
crimes,	1
now	1
recognize	1
his	1
authority,	1
the	1
title	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
ideal	1
of	1
grandeur	1
and	1
glory,	1
which	1
seems	1
excellent	1
and	1
reasonable	1
to	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
As	1
if	1
measuring	1
themselves	1
and	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
movement,	1
the	1
western	1
forces	1
push	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
1805,	1
1806,	1
1807,	1
and	1
1809,	1
gaining	1
strength	1
and	1
growing.	1
In	1
1811	1
the	1
group	1
of	1
people	1
that	1
had	1
formed	1
in	1
France	1
unites	1
into	1
one	1
group	1
with	1
the	1
peoples	1
of	1
Central	1
Europe.	1
The	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
justification	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
stands	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
grows	1
with	1
the	1
increased	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
group.	1
During	1
the	1
ten-year	1
preparatory	1
period	1
this	1
man	1
had	1
formed	1
relations	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
crowned	1
heads	1
of	1
Europe.	1
The	1
discredited	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
can	1
oppose	1
no	1
reasonable	1
ideal	1
to	1
the	1
insensate	1
Napoleonic	1
ideal	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
grandeur.	1
One	1
after	1
another	1
they	1
hasten	1
to	1
display	1
their	1
insignificance	1
before	1
him.	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
sends	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
great	1
man's	1
mercy;	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Austria	1
considers	1
it	1
a	1
favor	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
receives	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
Caesars	1
into	1
his	1
bed;	1
the	1
Pope,	1
the	1
guardian	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
nations	1
hold	1
sacred,	1
utilizes	1
religion	1
for	1
the	1
aggrandizement	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
man.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
Napoleon	1
who	1
prepares	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
his	1
role,	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
all	1
those	1
round	1
him	1
who	1
prepare	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
on	1
himself	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
happening	1
and	1
has	1
to	1
happen.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
step,	1
no	1
crime	1
or	1
petty	1
fraud	1
he	1
commits,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
those	1
around	1
him	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
represented	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
deed.	1
The	1
most	1
suitable	1
fete	1
the	1
Germans	1
can	1
devise	1
for	1
him	1
is	1
a	1
celebration	1
of	1
Jena	1
and	1
Auerstadt.	1
Not	1
only	1
is	1
he	1
great,	1
but	1
so	1
are	1
his	1
ancestors,	1
his	1
brothers,	1
his	1
stepsons,	1
and	1
his	1
brothers-in-law.	1
Everything	1
is	1
done	1
to	1
deprive	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
his	1
reason	1
and	1
to	1
prepare	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
terrible	1
part.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
ready	1
so	1
too	1
are	1
the	1
forces.	1
	1
The	1
invasion	1
pushes	1
eastward	1
and	1
reaches	1
its	1
final	1
goal--Moscow.	1
That	1
city	1
is	1
taken;	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
suffers	1
heavier	1
losses	1
than	1
the	1
opposing	1
armies	1
had	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
war	1
from	1
Austerlitz	1
to	1
Wagram.	1
But	1
suddenly	1
instead	1
of	1
those	1
chances	1
and	1
that	1
genius	1
which	1
hitherto	1
had	1
so	1
consistently	1
led	1
him	1
by	1
an	1
uninterrupted	1
series	1
of	1
successes	1
to	1
the	1
predestined	1
goal,	1
an	1
innumerable	1
sequence	1
of	1
inverse	1
chances	1
occur--from	1
the	1
cold	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
Borodino	1
to	1
the	1
sparks	1
which	1
set	1
Moscow	1
on	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
frosts--and	1
instead	1
of	1
genius,	1
stupidity	1
and	1
immeasurable	1
baseness	1
become	1
evident.	1
	1
The	1
invaders	1
flee,	1
turn	1
back,	1
flee	1
again,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
chances	1
are	1
now	1
not	1
for	1
Napoleon	1
but	1
always	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
A	1
countermovement	1
is	1
then	1
accomplished	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west	1
with	1
a	1
remarkable	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
preceding	1
movement	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east.	1
Attempted	1
drives	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west--similar	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
movements	1
of	1
1805,	1
1807,	1
and	1
1809--precede	1
the	1
great	1
westward	1
movement;	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
coalescence	1
into	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
enormous	1
dimensions;	1
the	1
same	1
adhesion	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Central	1
Europe	1
to	1
the	1
movement;	1
the	1
same	1
hesitation	1
midway,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
increasing	1
rapidity	1
as	1
the	1
goal	1
is	1
approached.	1
	1
Paris,	1
the	1
ultimate	1
goal,	1
is	1
reached.	1
The	1
Napoleonic	1
government	1
and	1
army	1
are	1
destroyed.	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
of	1
any	1
account;	1
all	1
his	1
actions	1
are	1
evidently	1
pitiful	1
and	1
mean,	1
but	1
again	1
an	1
inexplicable	1
chance	1
occurs.	1
The	1
allies	1
detest	1
Napoleon	1
whom	1
they	1
regard	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
sufferings.	1
Deprived	1
of	1
power	1
and	1
authority,	1
his	1
crimes	1
and	1
his	1
craft	1
exposed,	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
appeared	1
to	1
them	1
what	1
he	1
appeared	1
ten	1
years	1
previously	1
and	1
one	1
year	1
later--an	1
outlawed	1
brigand.	1
But	1
by	1
some	1
strange	1
chance	1
no	1
one	1
perceives	1
this.	1
His	1
part	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
ended.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
ten	1
years	1
before	1
and	1
a	1
year	1
later	1
was	1
considered	1
an	1
outlawed	1
brigand	1
is	1
sent	1
to	1
an	1
island	1
two	1
days'	1
sail	1
from	1
France,	1
which	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
is	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
dominion,	1
and	1
guards	1
are	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
money	1
are	1
paid	1
him.	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
The	1
flood	1
of	1
nations	1
begins	1
to	1
subside	1
into	1
its	1
normal	1
channels.	1
The	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
movement	1
abate,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
calm	1
surface	1
eddies	1
are	1
formed	1
in	1
which	1
float	1
the	1
diplomatists,	1
who	1
imagine	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
caused	1
the	1
floods	1
to	1
abate.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
smooth	1
sea	1
again	1
suddenly	1
becomes	1
disturbed.	1
The	1
diplomatists	1
think	1
that	1
their	1
disagreements	1
are	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
fresh	1
pressure	1
of	1
natural	1
forces;	1
they	1
anticipate	1
war	1
between	1
their	1
sovereigns;	1
the	1
position	1
seems	1
to	1
them	1
insoluble.	1
But	1
the	1
wave	1
they	1
feel	1
to	1
be	1
rising	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
quarter	1
they	1
expect.	1
It	1
rises	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
as	1
before--Paris.	1
The	1
last	1
backwash	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
occurs:	1
a	1
backwash	1
which	1
serves	1
to	1
solve	1
the	1
apparently	1
insuperable	1
diplomatic	1
difficulties	1
and	1
ends	1
the	1
military	1
movement	1
of	1
that	1
period	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
devastated	1
France	1
returns	1
to	1
France	1
alone,	1
without	1
any	1
conspiracy	1
and	1
without	1
soldiers.	1
Any	1
guard	1
might	1
arrest	1
him,	1
but	1
by	1
strange	1
chance	1
no	1
one	1
does	1
so	1
and	1
all	1
rapturously	1
greet	1
the	1
man	1
they	1
cursed	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
will	1
curse	1
again	1
a	1
month	1
later.	1
	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
still	1
needed	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
final	1
collective	1
act.	1
	1
That	1
act	1
is	1
performed.	1
	1
The	1
last	1
role	1
is	1
played.	1
The	1
actor	1
is	1
bidden	1
to	1
disrobe	1
and	1
wash	1
off	1
his	1
powder	1
and	1
paint:	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
wanted	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
And	1
some	1
years	1
pass	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
plays	1
a	1
pitiful	1
comedy	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
solitude	1
on	1
his	1
island,	1
justifying	1
his	1
actions	1
by	1
intrigues	1
and	1
lies	1
when	1
the	1
justification	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
needed,	1
and	1
displaying	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
people	1
had	1
mistaken	1
for	1
strength	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
an	1
unseen	1
hand	1
directed	1
his	1
actions.	1
	1
The	1
manager	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
drama	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
stripped	1
the	1
actor	1
shows	1
him	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
"See	1
what	1
you	1
believed	1
in!	1
This	1
is	1
he!	1
Do	1
you	1
now	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
he	1
but	1
I	1
who	1
moved	1
you?"	1
	1
But	1
dazed	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
movement,	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
before	1
people	1
understood	1
this.	1
	1
Still	1
greater	1
coherence	1
and	1
inevitability	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Alexander	1
I,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
countermovement	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west.	1
	1
What	1
was	1
needed	1
for	1
him	1
who,	1
overshadowing	1
others,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
that	1
movement	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west?	1
	1
What	1
was	1
needed	1
was	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
a	1
sympathy	1
with	1
European	1
affairs,	1
but	1
a	1
remote	1
sympathy	1
not	1
dulled	1
by	1
petty	1
interests;	1
a	1
moral	1
superiority	1
over	1
those	1
sovereigns	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
who	1
co-operated	1
with	1
him;	1
a	1
mild	1
and	1
attractive	1
personality;	1
and	1
a	1
personal	1
grievance	1
against	1
Napoleon.	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
Alexander	1
I;	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
by	1
innumerable	1
so-called	1
chances	1
in	1
his	1
life:	1
his	1
education,	1
his	1
early	1
liberalism,	1
the	1
advisers	1
who	1
surrounded	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
Austerlitz,	1
and	1
Tilsit,	1
and	1
Erfurt.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
national	1
war	1
he	1
was	1
inactive	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
needed.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
a	1
general	1
European	1
war	1
presented	1
itself	1
he	1
appeared	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
given	1
moment	1
and,	1
uniting	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
Europe,	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
goal.	1
	1
The	1
goal	1
is	1
reached.	1
After	1
the	1
final	1
war	1
of	1
1815	1
Alexander	1
possesses	1
all	1
possible	1
power.	1
How	1
does	1
he	1
use	1
it?	1
	1
Alexander	1
I--the	1
pacifier	1
of	1
Europe,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
from	1
his	1
early	1
years	1
had	1
striven	1
only	1
for	1
his	1
people's	1
welfare,	1
the	1
originator	1
of	1
the	1
liberal	1
innovations	1
in	1
his	1
fatherland--now	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
utmost	1
power	1
and	1
therefore	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
bringing	1
about	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
peoples--at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
exile	1
was	1
drawing	1
up	1
childish	1
and	1
mendacious	1
plans	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
mankind	1
happy	1
had	1
he	1
retained	1
power--Alexander	1
I,	1
having	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
mission	1
and	1
feeling	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
him,	1
suddenly	1
recognizes	1
the	1
insignificance	1
of	1
that	1
supposed	1
power,	1
turns	1
away	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
gives	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
contemptible	1
men	1
whom	1
he	1
despises,	1
saying	1
only:	1
	1
"Not	1
unto	1
us,	1
not	1
unto	1
us,	1
but	1
unto	1
Thy	1
Name!...	1
I	1
too	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
you.	1
Let	1
me	1
live	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
of	1
God."	1
	1
As	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
each	1
atom	1
of	1
ether	1
is	1
a	1
sphere	1
complete	1
in	1
itself,	1
and	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
only	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
too	1
immense	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
comprehend,	1
so	1
each	1
individual	1
has	1
within	1
himself	1
his	1
own	1
aims	1
and	1
yet	1
has	1
them	1
to	1
serve	1
a	1
general	1
purpose	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
man.	1
	1
A	1
bee	1
settling	1
on	1
a	1
flower	1
has	1
stung	1
a	1
child.	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
bees	1
and	1
declares	1
that	1
bees	1
exist	1
to	1
sting	1
people.	1
A	1
poet	1
admires	1
the	1
bee	1
sucking	1
from	1
the	1
chalice	1
of	1
a	1
flower	1
and	1
says	1
it	1
exists	1
to	1
suck	1
the	1
fragrance	1
of	1
flowers.	1
A	1
beekeeper,	1
seeing	1
the	1
bee	1
collect	1
pollen	1
from	1
flowers	1
and	1
carry	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
hive,	1
says	1
that	1
it	1
exists	1
to	1
gather	1
honey.	1
Another	1
beekeeper	1
who	1
has	1
studied	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
more	1
closely	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
bee	1
gathers	1
pollen	1
dust	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
young	1
bees	1
and	1
rear	1
a	1
queen,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
exists	1
to	1
perpetuate	1
its	1
race.	1
A	1
botanist	1
notices	1
that	1
the	1
bee	1
flying	1
with	1
the	1
pollen	1
of	1
a	1
male	1
flower	1
to	1
a	1
pistil	1
fertilizes	1
the	1
latter,	1
and	1
sees	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
bee's	1
existence.	1
Another,	1
observing	1
the	1
migration	1
of	1
plants,	1
notices	1
that	1
the	1
bee	1
helps	1
in	1
this	1
work,	1
and	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
lies	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
bee.	1
But	1
the	1
ultimate	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
bee	1
is	1
not	1
exhausted	1
by	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
second,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
processes	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
can	1
discern.	1
The	1
higher	1
the	1
human	1
intellect	1
rises	1
in	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
these	1
purposes,	1
the	1
more	1
obvious	1
it	1
becomes,	1
that	1
the	1
ultimate	1
purpose	1
is	1
beyond	1
our	1
comprehension.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
accessible	1
to	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
bee	1
to	1
other	1
manifestations	1
of	1
life.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
historic	1
characters	1
and	1
nations.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
Natasha's	1
wedding	1
to	1
Bezukhov,	1
which	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
1813,	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
happy	1
event	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Rostovs.	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
died	1
that	1
same	1
year	1
and,	1
as	1
always	1
happens,	1
after	1
the	1
father's	1
death	1
the	1
family	1
group	1
broke	1
up.	1
	1
The	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
year:	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
the	1
flight	1
from	1
it,	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
Natasha's	1
despair,	1
Petya's	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
countess'	1
grief	1
fell	1
blow	1
after	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
count's	1
head.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
events,	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
old	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
spiritual	1
sense	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
and	1
inviting	1
further	1
blows	1
which	1
would	1
finish	1
him.	1
He	1
seemed	1
now	1
frightened	1
and	1
distraught	1
and	1
now	1
unnaturally	1
animated	1
and	1
enterprising.	1
	1
The	1
arrangements	1
for	1
Natasha's	1
marriage	1
occupied	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
He	1
ordered	1
dinners	1
and	1
suppers	1
and	1
obviously	1
tried	1
to	1
appear	1
cheerful,	1
but	1
his	1
cheerfulness	1
was	1
not	1
infectious	1
as	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
be:	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
evoked	1
the	1
compassion	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
and	1
liked	1
him.	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
left,	1
he	1
grew	1
very	1
quiet	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
depression.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
he	1
fell	1
ill	1
and	1
took	1
to	1
his	1
bed.	1
He	1
realized	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
get	1
up	1
again,	1
despite	1
the	1
doctor's	1
encouragement.	1
The	1
countess	1
passed	1
a	1
fortnight	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
by	1
his	1
pillow	1
without	1
undressing.	1
Every	1
time	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
medicine	1
he	1
sobbed	1
and	1
silently	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
On	1
his	1
last	1
day,	1
sobbing,	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
and	1
his	1
absent	1
son	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
for	1
having	1
dissipated	1
their	1
property--that	1
being	1
the	1
chief	1
fault	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
conscious.	1
After	1
receiving	1
communion	1
and	1
unction	1
he	1
quietly	1
died;	1
and	1
next	1
day	1
a	1
throng	1
of	1
acquaintances	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
pay	1
their	1
last	1
respects	1
to	1
the	1
deceased	1
filled	1
the	1
house	1
rented	1
by	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
All	1
these	1
acquaintances,	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
dined	1
and	1
danced	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
laughed	1
at	1
him,	1
now	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
common	1
feeling	1
of	1
self-reproach	1
and	1
emotion,	1
as	1
if	1
justifying	1
themselves:	1
"Well,	1
whatever	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
worthy	1
man.	1
You	1
don't	1
meet	1
such	1
men	1
nowadays....	1
And	1
which	1
of	1
us	1
has	1
not	1
weaknesses	1
of	1
his	1
own?"	1
	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
when	1
the	1
count's	1
affairs	1
had	1
become	1
so	1
involved	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
if	1
he	1
lived	1
another	1
year	1
that	1
he	1
unexpectedly	1
died.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
in	1
Paris	1
when	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
death	1
reached	1
him.	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
resigned	1
his	1
commission,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
accepted	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
affairs	1
became	1
quite	1
obvious	1
a	1
month	1
after	1
his	1
death,	1
surprising	1
everyone	1
by	1
the	1
immense	1
total	1
of	1
small	1
debts	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
suspected.	1
The	1
debts	1
amounted	1
to	1
double	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
property.	1
	1
Friends	1
and	1
relations	1
advised	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
decline	1
the	1
inheritance.	1
But	1
he	1
regarded	1
such	1
a	1
refusal	1
as	1
a	1
slur	1
on	1
his	1
father's	1
memory,	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
sacred,	1
and	1
therefore	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
refusing	1
and	1
accepted	1
the	1
inheritance	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
obligation	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
debts.	1
	1
The	1
creditors	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
silent,	1
restrained	1
by	1
a	1
vague	1
but	1
powerful	1
influence	1
exerted	1
on	1
them	1
while	1
he	1
lived	1
by	1
the	1
count's	1
careless	1
good	1
nature,	1
all	1
proceeded	1
to	1
enforce	1
their	1
claims	1
at	1
once.	1
As	1
always	1
happens	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
rivalry	1
sprang	1
up	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
should	1
get	1
paid	1
first,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
like	1
Mitenka	1
held	1
promissory	1
notes	1
given	1
them	1
as	1
presents	1
now	1
became	1
the	1
most	1
exacting	1
of	1
the	1
creditors.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
allowed	1
no	1
respite	1
and	1
no	1
peace,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
pity	1
the	1
old	1
man--the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
losses	1
(if	1
they	1
were	1
losses)--now	1
remorselessly	1
pursued	1
the	1
young	1
heir	1
who	1
had	1
voluntarily	1
undertaken	1
the	1
debts	1
and	1
was	1
obviously	1
not	1
guilty	1
of	1
contracting	1
them.	1
	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
plans	1
Nicholas	1
tried	1
succeeded;	1
the	1
estate	1
was	1
sold	1
by	1
auction	1
for	1
half	1
its	1
value,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
debts	1
still	1
remained	1
unpaid.	1
Nicholas	1
accepted	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
offered	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
brother-in-	1
law	1
Bezukhov	1
to	1
pay	1
off	1
debts	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
genuinely	1
due	1
for	1
value	1
received.	1
And	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
imprisoned	1
for	1
the	1
remainder,	1
as	1
the	1
creditors	1
threatened,	1
he	1
re-entered	1
the	1
government	1
service.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
rejoin	1
the	1
army	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
colonel	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
vacancy,	1
for	1
his	1
mother	1
now	1
clung	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
her	1
one	1
hold	1
on	1
life;	1
and	1
so	1
despite	1
his	1
reluctance	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow	1
among	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
before,	1
and	1
despite	1
his	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
the	1
civil	1
service,	1
he	1
accepted	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
that	1
service,	1
doffed	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
fond,	1
and	1
moved	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
Sonya	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Sivtsev	1
Vrazhek.	1
	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Pierre	1
were	1
living	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
clear	1
idea	1
of	1
Nicholas'	1
circumstances.	1
Having	1
borrowed	1
money	1
from	1
his	1
brother-in-law,	1
Nicholas	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
wretched	1
condition	1
from	1
him.	1
His	1
position	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
difficult	1
because	1
with	1
his	1
salary	1
of	1
twelve	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
keep	1
himself,	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
had	1
to	1
shield	1
his	1
mother	1
from	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
poverty.	1
The	1
countess	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
of	1
life	1
without	1
the	1
luxurious	1
conditions	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
from	1
childhood	1
and,	1
unable	1
to	1
realize	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
son,	1
kept	1
demanding	1
now	1
a	1
carriage	1
(which	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
keep)	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
a	1
friend,	1
now	1
some	1
expensive	1
article	1
of	1
food	1
for	1
herself,	1
or	1
wine	1
for	1
her	1
son,	1
or	1
money	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
present	1
as	1
a	1
surprise	1
for	1
Natasha	1
or	1
Sonya,	1
or	1
for	1
Nicholas	1
himself.	1
	1
Sonya	1
kept	1
house,	1
attended	1
on	1
her	1
aunt,	1
read	1
to	1
her,	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
whims	1
and	1
secret	1
ill-will,	1
and	1
helped	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
conceal	1
their	1
poverty	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
countess.	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
himself	1
irredeemably	1
indebted	1
to	1
Sonya	1
for	1
all	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
for	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
greatly	1
admired	1
her	1
patience	1
and	1
devotion,	1
but	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
aloof	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
He	1
seemed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
reproach	1
her	1
for	1
being	1
too	1
perfect,	1
and	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
reproach	1
her	1
with.	1
She	1
had	1
all	1
that	1
people	1
are	1
valued	1
for,	1
but	1
little	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
love	1
her.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
valued	1
her	1
the	1
less	1
he	1
loved	1
her.	1
He	1
had	1
taken	1
her	1
at	1
her	1
word	1
when	1
she	1
wrote	1
giving	1
him	1
his	1
freedom	1
and	1
now	1
behaved	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
forgotten	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
be	1
renewed.	1
	1
Nicholas'	1
position	1
became	1
worse	1
and	1
worse.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
putting	1
something	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
salary	1
proved	1
a	1
dream.	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
save	1
anything,	1
but	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
mother's	1
demands	1
he	1
even	1
incurred	1
some	1
small	1
debts.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
situation.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
marrying	1
some	1
rich	1
woman,	1
which	1
was	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
female	1
relations,	1
was	1
repugnant	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
other	1
way	1
out--his	1
mother's	1
death--	1
never	1
entered	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
and	1
hoped	1
for	1
nothing,	1
and	1
deep	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
experienced	1
a	1
gloomy	1
and	1
stern	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
an	1
uncomplaining	1
endurance	1
of	1
his	1
position.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
avoid	1
his	1
old	1
acquaintances	1
with	1
their	1
commiseration	1
and	1
offensive	1
offers	1
of	1
assistance;	1
he	1
avoided	1
all	1
distraction	1
and	1
recreation,	1
and	1
even	1
at	1
home	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
play	1
cards	1
with	1
his	1
mother,	1
pace	1
silently	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
smoke	1
one	1
pipe	1
after	1
another.	1
He	1
seemed	1
carefully	1
to	1
cherish	1
within	1
himself	1
the	1
gloomy	1
mood	1
which	1
alone	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
endure	1
his	1
position.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
winter	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
From	1
reports	1
current	1
in	1
town	1
she	1
learned	1
how	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
situated,	1
and	1
how	1
"the	1
son	1
has	1
sacrificed	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
mother,"	1
as	1
people	1
were	1
saying.	1
	1
"I	1
never	1
expected	1
anything	1
else	1
of	1
him,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
herself,	1
feeling	1
a	1
joyous	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
him.	1
Remembering	1
her	1
friendly	1
relations	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
almost	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
But	1
remembering	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
Nicholas	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
she	1
was	1
shy	1
about	1
doing	1
so.	1
Making	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
she	1
did	1
however	1
go	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
them	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
after	1
her	1
arrival	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
as	1
the	1
countess'	1
room	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
reached	1
through	1
his.	1
But	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
greeted	1
with	1
pleasure	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
expected,	1
at	1
his	1
first	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
cold,	1
stiff,	1
proud	1
expression	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
on	1
it	1
before.	1
He	1
inquired	1
about	1
her	1
health,	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
having	1
sat	1
there	1
for	1
five	1
minutes	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
room	1
Nicholas	1
met	1
her	1
again,	1
and	1
with	1
marked	1
solemnity	1
and	1
stiffness	1
accompanied	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
To	1
her	1
remarks	1
about	1
his	1
mother's	1
health	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
"What's	1
that	1
to	1
you?	1
Leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace,"	1
his	1
looks	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Why	1
does	1
she	1
come	1
prowling	1
here?	1
What	1
does	1
she	1
want?	1
I	1
can't	1
bear	1
these	1
ladies	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
civilities!"	1
said	1
he	1
aloud	1
in	1
Sonya's	1
presence,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
repress	1
his	1
vexation,	1
after	1
the	1
princess'	1
carriage	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Nicholas,	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
like	1
that?"	1
cried	1
Sonya,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
conceal	1
her	1
delight.	1
"She	1
is	1
so	1
kind	1
and	1
Mamma	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
her!"	1
	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
avoid	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
any	1
more.	1
But	1
after	1
her	1
visit	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
spoke	1
of	1
her	1
several	1
times	1
a	1
day.	1
	1
She	1
sang	1
her	1
praises,	1
insisted	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
must	1
call	1
on	1
her,	1
expressed	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
often,	1
but	1
yet	1
always	1
became	1
ill-humored	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
her.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
silence	1
when	1
his	1
mother	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
princess,	1
but	1
his	1
silence	1
irritated	1
her.	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
admirable	1
and	1
excellent	1
young	1
woman,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"and	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
call	1
on	1
her.	1
You	1
would	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
seeing	1
somebody,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
dull	1
for	1
you	1
only	1
seeing	1
us."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
want	1
to,	1
Mamma."	1
	1
"You	1
used	1
to	1
want	1
to,	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
don't.	1
Really	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
you,	1
my	1
dear.	1
One	1
day	1
you	1
are	1
dull,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
you	1
refuse	1
to	1
see	1
anyone."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
never	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
dull."	1
	1
"Why,	1
you	1
said	1
yourself	1
you	1
don't	1
want	1
even	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
admirable	1
young	1
woman	1
and	1
you	1
always	1
liked	1
her,	1
but	1
now	1
suddenly	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
notion	1
or	1
other	1
in	1
your	1
head.	1
You	1
hide	1
everything	1
from	1
me."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,	1
Mamma."	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
were	1
asking	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
disagreeable	1
now--but	1
I	1
only	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
return	1
a	1
call.	1
One	1
would	1
think	1
mere	1
politeness	1
required	1
it....	1
Well,	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
you,	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
won't	1
interfere	1
any	1
more	1
since	1
you	1
have	1
secrets	1
from	1
your	1
mother."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
I'll	1
go	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
it."	1
	1
"It	1
doesn't	1
matter	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
it	1
for	1
your	1
sake."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
sighed,	1
bit	1
his	1
mustache,	1
and	1
laid	1
out	1
the	1
cards	1
for	1
a	1
patience,	1
trying	1
to	1
divert	1
his	1
mother's	1
attention	1
to	1
another	1
topic.	1
	1
The	1
same	1
conversation	1
was	1
repeated	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
after,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
that.	1
	1
After	1
her	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
her	1
unexpectedly	1
chilly	1
reception	1
by	1
Nicholas,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
confessed	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
right	1
in	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
call.	1
	1
"I	1
expected	1
nothing	1
else,"	1
she	1
told	1
herself,	1
calling	1
her	1
pride	1
to	1
her	1
aid.	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
old	1
lady,	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
kind	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
under	1
many	1
obligations."	1
	1
But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
pacify	1
herself	1
with	1
these	1
reflections;	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
remorse	1
troubled	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
visit.	1
Though	1
she	1
had	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
again	1
and	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
whole	1
matter,	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
an	1
awkward	1
position.	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
what	1
distressed	1
her,	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
relation	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
His	1
cold,	1
polite	1
manner	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
(she	1
knew	1
that)	1
but	1
it	1
concealed	1
something,	1
and	1
until	1
she	1
could	1
discover	1
what	1
that	1
something	1
was,	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
ease.	1
	1
One	1
day	1
in	1
midwinter	1
when	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
schoolroom	1
attending	1
to	1
her	1
nephew's	1
lessons,	1
she	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
Rostov	1
had	1
called.	1
With	1
a	1
firm	1
resolution	1
not	1
to	1
betray	1
herself	1
and	1
not	1
show	1
her	1
agitation,	1
she	1
sent	1
for	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
Her	1
first	1
glance	1
at	1
Nicholas'	1
face	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
come	1
to	1
fulfill	1
the	1
demands	1
of	1
politeness,	1
and	1
she	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
addressed	1
her.	1
	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
health,	1
of	1
their	1
mutual	1
friends,	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
war	1
news,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
ten	1
minutes	1
required	1
by	1
propriety	1
had	1
elapsed	1
after	1
which	1
a	1
visitor	1
may	1
rise,	1
Nicholas	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
say	1
good-by.	1
	1
With	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
help	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
maintained	1
the	1
conversation	1
very	1
well,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
moment,	1
just	1
when	1
he	1
rose,	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
of	1
talking	1
of	1
what	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
her,	1
and	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
why	1
she	1
alone	1
was	1
granted	1
so	1
little	1
happiness	1
in	1
life,	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
absent-mindedness	1
she	1
sat	1
still,	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
gazing	1
fixedly	1
before	1
her,	1
not	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
risen.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
and,	1
wishing	1
to	1
appear	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
her	1
abstraction,	1
made	1
some	1
remark	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
princess.	1
She	1
still	1
sat	1
motionless	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
suffering	1
on	1
her	1
gentle	1
face.	1
He	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
vaguely	1
conscious	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
sadness	1
her	1
face	1
expressed.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
and	1
say	1
something	1
pleasant,	1
but	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
Princess!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
She	1
started,	1
flushed,	1
and	1
sighed	1
deeply.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,"	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
if	1
waking	1
up.	1
"Are	1
you	1
going	1
already,	1
Count?	1
Well	1
then,	1
good-by!	1
Oh,	1
but	1
the	1
cushion	1
for	1
the	1
countess!"	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
I'll	1
fetch	1
it,"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
They	1
both	1
sat	1
silent,	1
with	1
an	1
occasional	1
glance	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Princess,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
smile,	1
"it	1
doesn't	1
seem	1
long	1
ago	1
since	1
we	1
first	1
met	1
at	1
Bogucharovo,	1
but	1
how	1
much	1
water	1
has	1
flowed	1
since	1
then!	1
In	1
what	1
distress	1
we	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
then,	1
yet	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
much	1
to	1
bring	1
back	1
that	1
time...	1
but	1
there's	1
no	1
bringing	1
it	1
back."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
gazed	1
intently	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
luminous	1
ones	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
fathom	1
the	1
hidden	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
which	1
would	1
explain	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"but	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
regret	1
the	1
past,	1
Count.	1
As	1
I	1
understand	1
your	1
present	1
life,	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
recall	1
it	1
with	1
satisfaction,	1
because	1
the	1
self-sacrifice	1
that	1
fills	1
it	1
now..."	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
accept	1
your	1
praise,"	1
he	1
interrupted	1
her	1
hurriedly.	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
continually	1
reproach	1
myself....	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
an	1
interesting	1
or	1
cheerful	1
subject."	1
	1
His	1
face	1
again	1
resumed	1
its	1
former	1
stiff	1
and	1
cold	1
expression.	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
and	1
loved,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
now	1
spoke.	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
this,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"I	1
had	1
come	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
you...	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
your	1
family	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
consider	1
my	1
sympathy	1
misplaced,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
mistaken,"	1
and	1
suddenly	1
her	1
voice	1
trembled.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
why,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
recovering	1
herself,	1
"but	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
different,	1
and..."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
a	1
thousand	1
reasons	1
why,"	1
laying	1
special	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
why.	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Princess,"	1
he	1
added	1
softly.	1
"Sometimes	1
it	1
is	1
hard."	1
	1
"So	1
that's	1
why!	1
That's	1
why!"	1
a	1
voice	1
whispered	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
soul.	1
"No,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
gay,	1
kind,	1
and	1
frank	1
look,	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
handsome	1
exterior,	1
that	1
I	1
loved	1
in	1
him.	1
I	1
divined	1
his	1
noble,	1
resolute,	1
self-sacrificing	1
spirit	1
too,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
poor	1
now	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
rich....	1
Yes,	1
that's	1
the	1
only	1
reason....	1
Yes,	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
that..."	1
And	1
remembering	1
his	1
former	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
looking	1
now	1
at	1
his	1
kind,	1
sorrowful	1
face,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
understood	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
coldness.	1
	1
"But	1
why,	1
Count,	1
why?"	1
she	1
almost	1
cried,	1
unconsciously	1
moving	1
closer	1
to	1
him.	1
"Why?	1
Tell	1
me.	1
You	1
must	1
tell	1
me!"	1
	1
He	1
was	1
silent.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
your	1
why,	1
Count,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
"but	1
it's	1
hard	1
for	1
me...	1
I	1
confess	1
it.	1
For	1
some	1
reason	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
our	1
former	1
friendship.	1
And	1
that	1
hurts	1
me."	1
There	1
were	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
voice.	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
so	1
little	1
happiness	1
in	1
life	1
that	1
every	1
loss	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
bear....	1
Excuse	1
me,	1
good-by!"	1
and	1
suddenly	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
was	1
hurrying	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
trying	1
to	1
stop	1
her.	1
"Princess!"	1
	1
She	1
turned	1
round.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
they	1
gazed	1
silently	1
into	1
one	1
another's	1
eyes--and	1
what	1
had	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
and	1
remote	1
suddenly	1
became	1
possible,	1
inevitable,	1
and	1
very	1
near.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
In	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
1813	1
Nicholas	1
married	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
Sonya.	1
	1
Within	1
four	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
paid	1
off	1
all	1
his	1
remaining	1
debts	1
without	1
selling	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
wife's	1
property,	1
and	1
having	1
received	1
a	1
small	1
inheritance	1
on	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
cousin	1
he	1
paid	1
his	1
debt	1
to	1
Pierre	1
as	1
well.	1
	1
In	1
another	1
three	1
years,	1
by	1
1820,	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
managed	1
his	1
affairs	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
small	1
estate	1
adjoining	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
and	1
was	1
negotiating	1
to	1
buy	1
back	1
Otradnoe--that	1
being	1
his	1
pet	1
dream.	1
	1
Having	1
started	1
farming	1
from	1
necessity,	1
he	1
soon	1
grew	1
so	1
devoted	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
became	1
his	1
favorite	1
and	1
almost	1
his	1
sole	1
occupation.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
a	1
plain	1
farmer:	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
innovations,	1
especially	1
the	1
English	1
ones	1
then	1
coming	1
into	1
vogue.	1
He	1
laughed	1
at	1
theoretical	1
treatises	1
on	1
estate	1
management,	1
disliked	1
factories,	1
the	1
raising	1
of	1
expensive	1
products,	1
and	1
the	1
buying	1
of	1
expensive	1
seed	1
corn,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
hobby	1
of	1
any	1
particular	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
estate.	1
He	1
always	1
had	1
before	1
his	1
mind's	1
eye	1
the	1
estate	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
and	1
not	1
any	1
particular	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
chief	1
thing	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
nitrogen	1
in	1
the	1
soil,	1
nor	1
the	1
oxygen	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
nor	1
manures,	1
nor	1
special	1
plows,	1
but	1
that	1
most	1
important	1
agent	1
by	1
which	1
nitrogen,	1
oxygen,	1
manure,	1
and	1
plow	1
were	1
made	1
effective--	1
the	1
peasant	1
laborer.	1
When	1
Nicholas	1
first	1
began	1
farming	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
understand	1
its	1
different	1
branches,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
serf	1
who	1
especially	1
attracted	1
his	1
attention.	1
The	1
peasant	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
tool,	1
but	1
also	1
a	1
judge	1
of	1
farming	1
and	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
himself.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
watched	1
the	1
serfs,	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
their	1
aims	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
considered	1
good	1
and	1
bad,	1
and	1
only	1
pretended	1
to	1
direct	1
them	1
and	1
give	1
orders	1
while	1
in	1
reality	1
learning	1
from	1
them	1
their	1
methods,	1
their	1
manner	1
of	1
speech,	1
and	1
their	1
judgment	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
bad.	1
Only	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
the	1
peasants'	1
tastes	1
and	1
aspirations,	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
talk	1
their	1
language,	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
hidden	1
meaning	1
of	1
their	1
words,	1
and	1
felt	1
akin	1
to	1
them	1
did	1
he	1
begin	1
boldly	1
to	1
manage	1
his	1
serfs,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
perform	1
toward	1
them	1
the	1
duties	1
demanded	1
of	1
him.	1
And	1
Nicholas'	1
management	1
produced	1
very	1
brilliant	1
results.	1
	1
Guided	1
by	1
some	1
gift	1
of	1
insight,	1
on	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
estates	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
unerringly	1
appointed	1
as	1
bailiff,	1
village	1
elder,	1
and	1
delegate,	1
the	1
very	1
men	1
the	1
serfs	1
would	1
themselves	1
have	1
chosen	1
had	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
choose,	1
and	1
these	1
posts	1
never	1
changed	1
hands.	1
Before	1
analyzing	1
the	1
properties	1
of	1
manure,	1
before	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
debit	1
and	1
credit	1
(as	1
he	1
ironically	1
called	1
it),	1
he	1
found	1
out	1
how	1
many	1
cattle	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
and	1
increased	1
the	1
number	1
by	1
all	1
possible	1
means.	1
He	1
kept	1
the	1
peasant	1
families	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
largest	1
groups	1
possible,	1
not	1
allowing	1
the	1
family	1
groups	1
to	1
divide	1
into	1
separate	1
households.	1
He	1
was	1
hard	1
alike	1
on	1
the	1
lazy,	1
the	1
depraved,	1
and	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
them	1
expelled	1
from	1
the	1
commune.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
careful	1
of	1
the	1
sowing	1
and	1
reaping	1
of	1
the	1
peasants'	1
hay	1
and	1
corn	1
as	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
few	1
landowners	1
had	1
their	1
crops	1
sown	1
and	1
harvested	1
so	1
early	1
and	1
so	1
well,	1
or	1
got	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
return,	1
as	1
did	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
He	1
disliked	1
having	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
domestic	1
serfs--the	1
"drones"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
them--and	1
everyone	1
said	1
he	1
spoiled	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
laxity.	1
When	1
a	1
decision	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
regarding	1
a	1
domestic	1
serf,	1
especially	1
if	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
punished,	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
undecided	1
and	1
consulted	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
house;	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
domestic	1
serf	1
conscripted	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
land	1
worker	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
without	1
the	1
least	1
hesitation.	1
He	1
never	1
felt	1
any	1
hesitation	1
in	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
peasants.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
every	1
decision	1
would	1
be	1
approved	1
by	1
them	1
all	1
with	1
very	1
few	1
exceptions.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
himself	1
either	1
to	1
be	1
hard	1
on	1
or	1
punish	1
a	1
man,	1
or	1
to	1
make	1
things	1
easy	1
for	1
or	1
reward	1
anyone,	1
merely	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
inclined	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
by	1
what	1
standard	1
he	1
judged	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
or	1
should	1
not	1
do,	1
but	1
the	1
standard	1
was	1
quite	1
firm	1
and	1
definite	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
Often,	1
speaking	1
with	1
vexation	1
of	1
some	1
failure	1
or	1
irregularity,	1
he	1
would	1
say:	1
"What	1
can	1
one	1
do	1
with	1
our	1
Russian	1
peasants?"	1
and	1
imagined	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
them.	1
	1
Yet	1
he	1
loved	1
"our	1
Russian	1
peasants"	1
and	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
had	1
understood	1
and	1
assimilated	1
the	1
one	1
way	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
farming	1
which	1
produced	1
good	1
results.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
this	1
passion	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
and	1
regretted	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
share	1
it;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
joys	1
and	1
vexations	1
he	1
derived	1
from	1
that	1
world,	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
remote	1
and	1
alien.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
particularly	1
animated	1
and	1
happy	1
when,	1
after	1
getting	1
up	1
at	1
daybreak	1
and	1
spending	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
threshing	1
floor,	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
sowing	1
or	1
mowing	1
or	1
reaping	1
to	1
have	1
tea	1
with	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
such	1
admiration	1
and	1
delight	1
of	1
the	1
farming	1
of	1
the	1
thrifty	1
and	1
well-	1
to-do	1
peasant	1
Matthew	1
Ermishin,	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
had	1
carted	1
corn	1
all	1
night;	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
(Nicholas')	1
sheaves	1
were	1
already	1
stacked	1
before	1
anyone	1
else	1
had	1
his	1
harvest	1
in.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
stepped	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
the	1
veranda	1
and	1
smiled	1
under	1
his	1
mustache	1
and	1
winked	1
so	1
joyfully,	1
when	1
warm	1
steady	1
rain	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
dry	1
and	1
thirsty	1
shoots	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
oats,	1
or	1
why	1
when	1
the	1
wind	1
carried	1
away	1
a	1
threatening	1
cloud	1
during	1
the	1
hay	1
harvest	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
barn,	1
flushed,	1
sunburned,	1
and	1
perspiring,	1
with	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
wormwood	1
and	1
gentian	1
in	1
his	1
hair	1
and,	1
gleefully	1
rubbing	1
his	1
hands,	1
would	1
say:	1
"Well,	1
one	1
more	1
day	1
and	1
my	1
grain	1
and	1
the	1
peasants'	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
under	1
cover."	1
	1
Still	1
less	1
did	1
she	1
understand	1
why	1
he,	1
kindhearted	1
and	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
anticipate	1
her	1
wishes,	1
should	1
become	1
almost	1
desperate	1
when	1
she	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
petition	1
from	1
some	1
peasant	1
men	1
or	1
women	1
who	1
had	1
appealed	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
excused	1
some	1
work;	1
why	1
he,	1
that	1
kind	1
Nicholas,	1
should	1
obstinately	1
refuse	1
her,	1
angrily	1
asking	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
interfere	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
business.	1
She	1
felt	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
world	1
apart,	1
which	1
he	1
loved	1
passionately	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
laws	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
fathomed.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
when,	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
him,	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
work	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
for	1
his	1
serfs,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
vexed	1
and	1
reply:	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least;	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
do	1
that	1
for	1
their	1
good!	1
That's	1
all	1
poetry	1
and	1
old	1
wives'	1
talk--all	1
that	1
doing	1
good	1
to	1
one's	1
neighbor!	1
What	1
I	1
want	1
is	1
that	1
our	1
children	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
begging.	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
our	1
affairs	1
in	1
order	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
alive,	1
that's	1
all.	1
And	1
to	1
do	1
that,	1
order	1
and	1
strictness	1
are	1
essential....	1
That's	1
all	1
about	1
it!"	1
said	1
he,	1
clenching	1
his	1
vigorous	1
fist.	1
"And	1
fairness,	1
of	1
course,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"for	1
if	1
the	1
peasant	1
is	1
naked	1
and	1
hungry	1
and	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
miserable	1
horse,	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
good	1
either	1
for	1
himself	1
or	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
And	1
all	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
was	1
fruitful--probably	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
good	1
to	1
others	1
for	1
virtue's	1
sake.	1
His	1
means	1
increased	1
rapidly;	1
serfs	1
from	1
neighboring	1
estates	1
came	1
to	1
beg	1
him	1
to	1
buy	1
them,	1
and	1
long	1
after	1
his	1
death	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
administration	1
was	1
devoutly	1
preserved	1
among	1
the	1
serfs.	1
"He	1
was	1
a	1
master...	1
the	1
peasants'	1
affairs	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
own.	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
trifled	1
with	1
either--in	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
master!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
One	1
matter	1
connected	1
with	1
his	1
management	1
sometimes	1
worried	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
his	1
quick	1
temper	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
hussar	1
habit	1
of	1
making	1
free	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
fists.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
reprehensible	1
in	1
this,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
marriage	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
that	1
form	1
of	1
punishment	1
suddenly	1
changed.	1
	1
Once	1
in	1
summer	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
from	1
Bogucharovo,	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
succeeded	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
when	1
Dron	1
died	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
dishonesty	1
and	1
various	1
irregularities.	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
to	1
question	1
him,	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
elder	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
few	1
replies	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
cries	1
and	1
blows	1
were	1
heard.	1
On	1
returning	1
to	1
lunch	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
who	1
sat	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
bent	1
low	1
over	1
her	1
embroidery	1
frame,	1
and	1
as	1
usual	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
that	1
morning.	1
Among	1
other	1
things	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
Bogucharovo	1
elder.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
turned	1
red	1
and	1
then	1
pale,	1
but	1
continued	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
head	1
bowed	1
and	1
lips	1
compressed	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
husband	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"Such	1
an	1
insolent	1
scoundrel!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
growing	1
hot	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
recollection	1
of	1
him.	1
"If	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
drunk	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
see...	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
Mary?"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
asked.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
raised	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
speak,	1
but	1
hastily	1
looked	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
puckered.	1
	1
"Why,	1
whatever	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
my	1
dearest?"	1
	1
The	1
looks	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
always	1
improved	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
tears.	1
She	1
never	1
cried	1
from	1
pain	1
or	1
vexation,	1
but	1
always	1
from	1
sorrow	1
or	1
pity,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
wept	1
her	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
acquired	1
an	1
irresistible	1
charm.	1
	1
The	1
moment	1
Nicholas	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
restrain	1
herself	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
I	1
saw	1
it...	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame,	1
but	1
why	1
do	1
you...	1
Nicholas!"	1
and	1
she	1
covered	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
said	1
nothing.	1
He	1
flushed	1
crimson,	1
left	1
her	1
side,	1
and	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
understood	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
weeping	1
about,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
at	1
once	1
agree	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
regarded	1
from	1
childhood	1
as	1
quite	1
an	1
everyday	1
event	1
was	1
wrong.	1
"Is	1
it	1
just	1
sentimentality,	1
old	1
wives'	1
tales,	1
or	1
is	1
she	1
right?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself.	1
Before	1
he	1
had	1
solved	1
that	1
point	1
he	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
filled	1
with	1
love	1
and	1
pain,	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
realized	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
sinning	1
against	1
himself.	1
	1
"Mary,"	1
he	1
said	1
softly,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
"it	1
will	1
never	1
happen	1
again;	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word.	1
Never,"	1
he	1
repeated	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
like	1
a	1
boy	1
asking	1
for	1
forgiveness.	1
	1
The	1
tears	1
flowed	1
faster	1
still	1
from	1
the	1
countess'	1
eyes.	1
She	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
when	1
did	1
you	1
break	1
your	1
cameo?"	1
she	1
asked	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
ring	1
with	1
a	1
cameo	1
of	1
Laocoon's	1
head.	1
	1
"Today--it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
affair.	1
Oh,	1
Mary,	1
don't	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
it!"	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
flushed.	1
"I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
it	1
shan't	1
occur	1
again,	1
and	1
let	1
this	1
always	1
be	1
a	1
reminder	1
to	1
me,"	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
broken	1
ring.	1
	1
After	1
that,	1
when	1
in	1
discussions	1
with	1
his	1
village	1
elders	1
or	1
stewards	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
fists	1
began	1
to	1
clench,	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
turn	1
the	1
broken	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
would	1
drop	1
his	1
eyes	1
before	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
making	1
him	1
angry.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
forget	1
himself	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
within	1
a	1
twelvemonth,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
confess	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
would	1
again	1
promise	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
really	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
"Mary,	1
you	1
must	1
despise	1
me!"	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
"I	1
deserve	1
it."	1
	1
"You	1
should	1
go,	1
go	1
away	1
at	1
once,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
feel	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
control	1
yourself,"	1
she	1
would	1
reply	1
sadly,	1
trying	1
to	1
comfort	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
gentry	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
respected	1
but	1
not	1
liked.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
concern	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
class,	1
and	1
consequently	1
some	1
thought	1
him	1
proud	1
and	1
others	1
thought	1
him	1
stupid.	1
The	1
whole	1
summer,	1
from	1
spring	1
sowing	1
to	1
harvest,	1
he	1
was	1
busy	1
with	1
the	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
farm.	1
In	1
autumn	1
he	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
hunting	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
business-like	1
seriousness--leaving	1
home	1
for	1
a	1
month,	1
or	1
even	1
two,	1
with	1
his	1
hunt.	1
In	1
winter	1
he	1
visited	1
his	1
other	1
villages	1
or	1
spent	1
his	1
time	1
reading.	1
The	1
books	1
he	1
read	1
were	1
chiefly	1
historical,	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
he	1
spent	1
a	1
certain	1
sum	1
every	1
year.	1
He	1
was	1
collecting,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
a	1
serious	1
library,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1
read	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
he	1
bought.	1
He	1
would	1
sit	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
air,	1
reading--a	1
task	1
he	1
first	1
imposed	1
upon	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
duty,	1
but	1
which	1
afterwards	1
became	1
a	1
habit	1
affording	1
him	1
a	1
special	1
kind	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
occupied	1
with	1
serious	1
matters.	1
In	1
winter,	1
except	1
for	1
business	1
excursions,	1
he	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
at	1
home	1
making	1
himself	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
entering	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
children's	1
relations	1
with	1
their	1
mother.	1
The	1
harmony	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
grew	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
and	1
he	1
daily	1
discovered	1
fresh	1
spiritual	1
treasures	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
marriage	1
Sonya	1
had	1
lived	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
Before	1
that,	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
told	1
his	1
wife	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
blaming	1
himself	1
and	1
commending	1
her.	1
He	1
had	1
asked	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
be	1
gentle	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
his	1
cousin.	1
She	1
thoroughly	1
realized	1
the	1
wrong	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
Sonya,	1
felt	1
herself	1
to	1
blame	1
toward	1
her,	1
and	1
imagined	1
that	1
her	1
wealth	1
had	1
influenced	1
Nicholas'	1
choice.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
Sonya	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
her,	1
but	1
often	1
felt	1
ill-will	1
toward	1
her	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
overcome.	1
	1
Once	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
Natasha	1
about	1
Sonya	1
and	1
about	1
her	1
own	1
injustice	1
toward	1
her.	1
	1
"You	1
know,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
"you	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
Gospels	1
a	1
great	1
deal--there	1
is	1
a	1
passage	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
just	1
fits	1
Sonya."	1
	1
"What?"	1
asked	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
surprised.	1
	1
"'To	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
given,	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away.'	1
You	1
remember?	1
She	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
not;	1
why,	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
Perhaps	1
she	1
lacks	1
egotism,	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
but	1
from	1
her	1
is	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
everything	1
has	1
been	1
taken	1
away.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
am	1
dreadfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
her.	1
Formerly	1
I	1
very	1
much	1
wanted	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
marry	1
her,	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
presentiment	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
off.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
sterile	1
flower,	1
you	1
know--like	1
some	1
strawberry	1
blossoms.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
doesn't	1
feel	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
or	1
I	1
would."	1
	1
Though	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
told	1
Natasha	1
that	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
Gospel	1
must	1
be	1
understood	1
differently,	1
yet	1
looking	1
at	1
Sonya	1
she	1
agreed	1
with	1
Natasha's	1
explanation.	1
It	1
really	1
seemed	1
that	1
Sonya	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
her	1
position	1
trying,	1
and	1
had	1
grown	1
quite	1
reconciled	1
to	1
her	1
lot	1
as	1
a	1
sterile	1
flower.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
individuals	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
as	1
a	1
whole.	1
Like	1
a	1
cat,	1
she	1
had	1
attached	1
herself	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
home.	1
She	1
waited	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
countess,	1
petted	1
and	1
spoiled	1
the	1
children,	1
was	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
render	1
the	1
small	1
services	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
gift,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
unconsciously	1
accepted	1
from	1
her	1
with	1
insufficient	1
gratitude.	1
	1
The	1
country	1
seat	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
had	1
been	1
rebuilt,	1
though	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
scale	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
	1
The	1
buildings,	1
begun	1
under	1
straitened	1
circumstances,	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
simple.	1
The	1
immense	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
stone	1
foundations	1
was	1
of	1
wood,	1
plastered	1
only	1
inside.	1
It	1
had	1
bare	1
deal	1
floors	1
and	1
was	1
furnished	1
with	1
very	1
simple	1
hard	1
sofas,	1
armchairs,	1
tables,	1
and	1
chairs	1
made	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
serf	1
carpenters	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
birchwood.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
spacious	1
and	1
had	1
rooms	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
serfs	1
and	1
apartments	1
for	1
visitors.	1
Whole	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
Bolkonskis'	1
relations	1
sometimes	1
came	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
with	1
sixteen	1
horses	1
and	1
dozens	1
of	1
servants	1
and	1
stayed	1
for	1
months.	1
Besides	1
that,	1
four	1
times	1
a	1
year,	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
days	1
and	1
birthdays	1
of	1
the	1
hosts,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
a	1
hundred	1
visitors	1
would	1
gather	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
life	1
pursued	1
its	1
unbroken	1
routine	1
with	1
its	1
ordinary	1
occupations,	1
and	1
its	1
breakfasts,	1
lunches,	1
dinners,	1
and	1
suppers,	1
provided	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
produce	1
of	1
the	1
estate.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
St.	1
Nicholas,	1
the	1
fifth	1
of	1
December,	1
1820.	1
Natasha	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
at	1
her	1
brother's	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
children	1
since	1
early	1
autumn.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
business	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
for	1
three	1
weeks	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
but	1
had	1
remained	1
there	1
nearly	1
seven	1
weeks	1
and	1
was	1
expected	1
back	1
every	1
minute.	1
	1
Besides	1
the	1
Bezukhov	1
family,	1
Nicholas'	1
old	1
friend	1
the	1
retired	1
General	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich	1
Denisov	1
was	1
staying	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
this	1
fifth	1
of	1
December.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
sixth,	1
which	1
was	1
his	1
name	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
house	1
would	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
visitors,	1
Nicholas	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
exchange	1
his	1
Tartar	1
tunic	1
for	1
a	1
tail	1
coat,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
narrow	1
boots	1
with	1
pointed	1
toes,	1
and	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
church	1
he	1
had	1
built,	1
and	1
then	1
receive	1
visitors	1
who	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
congratulate	1
him,	1
offer	1
them	1
refreshments,	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
elections	1
of	1
the	1
nobility;	1
but	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
entitled	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
way.	1
He	1
examined	1
the	1
bailiff's	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
in	1
Ryazan	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
his	1
wife's	1
nephew,	1
wrote	1
two	1
business	1
letters,	1
and	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
granaries,	1
cattle	1
yards	1
and	1
stables	1
before	1
dinner.	1
Having	1
taken	1
precautions	1
against	1
the	1
general	1
drunkenness	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
saint's	1
day,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
dinner,	1
and	1
without	1
having	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
private	1
talk	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
long	1
table	1
laid	1
for	1
twenty	1
persons,	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
whole	1
household	1
had	1
assembled.	1
At	1
that	1
table	1
were	1
his	1
mother,	1
his	1
mother's	1
old	1
lady	1
companion	1
Belova,	1
his	1
wife,	1
their	1
three	1
children	1
with	1
their	1
governess	1
and	1
tutor,	1
his	1
wife's	1
nephew	1
with	1
his	1
tutor,	1
Sonya,	1
Denisov,	1
Natasha,	1
her	1
three	1
children,	1
their	1
governess,	1
and	1
old	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
the	1
late	1
prince's	1
architect,	1
who	1
was	1
living	1
on	1
in	1
retirement	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
When	1
her	1
husband	1
took	1
his	1
place	1
she	1
concluded,	1
from	1
the	1
rapid	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
after	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
table	1
napkin	1
he	1
pushed	1
back	1
the	1
tumbler	1
and	1
wineglass	1
standing	1
before	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
humor,	1
as	1
was	1
sometimes	1
the	1
case	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
dinner	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1
farm--especially	1
before	1
the	1
soup.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
mood	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
quietly	1
waited	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
soup	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
admit	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
his	1
ill-humor.	1
But	1
today	1
she	1
quite	1
forgot	1
that	1
and	1
was	1
hurt	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
her	1
without	1
any	1
reason,	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
unhappy.	1
She	1
asked	1
him	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been.	1
He	1
replied.	1
She	1
again	1
inquired	1
whether	1
everything	1
was	1
going	1
well	1
on	1
the	1
farm.	1
Her	1
unnatural	1
tone	1
made	1
him	1
wince	1
unpleasantly	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
hastily.	1
	1
"Then	1
I'm	1
not	1
mistaken,"	1
thought	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"Why	1
is	1
he	1
cross	1
with	1
me?"	1
She	1
concluded	1
from	1
his	1
tone	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
vexed	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
conversation.	1
She	1
knew	1
her	1
remarks	1
sounded	1
unnatural,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
asking	1
some	1
more	1
questions.	1
	1
Thanks	1
to	1
Denisov	1
the	1
conversation	1
at	1
table	1
soon	1
became	1
general	1
and	1
lively,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
When	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
went	1
as	1
usual	1
to	1
thank	1
the	1
old	1
countess,	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
"You	1
always	1
have	1
such	1
strange	1
fancies!	1
I	1
didn't	1
even	1
think	1
of	1
being	1
angry,"	1
he	1
replied.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
imply:	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
angry	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
tell	1
you	1
why."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
lived	1
together	1
so	1
happily	1
that	1
even	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
countess,	1
who	1
felt	1
jealous	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
them	1
to	1
disagree,	1
could	1
find	1
nothing	1
to	1
reproach	1
them	1
with;	1
but	1
even	1
they	1
had	1
their	1
moments	1
of	1
antagonism.	1
Occasionally,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
just	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
happiest	1
together,	1
they	1
suddenly	1
had	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
estrangement	1
and	1
hostility,	1
which	1
occurred	1
most	1
frequently	1
during	1
Countess	1
Mary's	1
pregnancies,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
"Well,	1
messieurs	1
et	1
mesdames,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
loudly	1
and	1
with	1
apparent	1
cheerfulness	1
(it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
vex	1
her),	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
my	1
feet	1
since	1
six	1
this	1
morning.	1
Tomorrow	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
suffer,	1
so	1
today	1
I'll	1
go	1
and	1
rest."	1
	1
And	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
sitting	1
room	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"That's	1
always	1
the	1
way,"	1
thought	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"He	1
talks	1
to	1
everyone	1
except	1
me.	1
I	1
see...	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
repulsive	1
to	1
him,	1
especially	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
this	1
condition."	1
She	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
expanded	1
figure	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
at	1
her	1
pale,	1
sallow,	1
emaciated	1
face	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
eyes	1
now	1
looked	1
larger	1
than	1
ever.	1
	1
And	1
everything	1
annoyed	1
her--Denisov's	1
shouting	1
and	1
laughter,	1
Natasha's	1
talk,	1
and	1
especially	1
a	1
quick	1
glance	1
Sonya	1
gave	1
her.	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
first	1
excuse	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
found	1
for	1
feeling	1
irritated.	1
	1
Having	1
sat	1
awhile	1
with	1
her	1
visitors	1
without	1
understanding	1
anything	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying,	1
she	1
softly	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
The	1
children	1
were	1
playing	1
at	1
"going	1
to	1
Moscow"	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
made	1
of	1
chairs	1
and	1
invited	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them.	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
played	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
little,	1
but	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
his	1
unreasonable	1
crossness	1
worried	1
her.	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and,	1
walking	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
with	1
difficulty,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
small	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
asleep;	1
I'll	1
have	1
an	1
explanation	1
with	1
him,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself.	1
Little	1
Andrew,	1
her	1
eldest	1
boy,	1
imitating	1
his	1
mother,	1
followed	1
her	1
on	1
tiptoe.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
him.	1
	1
"Mary,	1
dear,	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
asleep--he	1
was	1
so	1
tired,"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
meeting	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
sitting	1
room	1
(it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
that	1
she	1
crossed	1
her	1
path	1
everywhere).	1
"Andrew	1
may	1
wake	1
him."	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
round,	1
saw	1
little	1
Andrew	1
following	1
her,	1
felt	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
right,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
flushed	1
and	1
with	1
evident	1
difficulty	1
refrained	1
from	1
saying	1
something	1
harsh.	1
She	1
made	1
no	1
reply,	1
but	1
to	1
avoid	1
obeying	1
Sonya	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Andrew	1
to	1
follow	1
her	1
quietly	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
Sonya	1
went	1
away	1
by	1
another	1
door.	1
From	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
sleeping	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
even	1
breathing,	1
every	1
slightest	1
tone	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
familiar	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
As	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
it	1
she	1
saw	1
before	1
her	1
his	1
smooth	1
handsome	1
forehead,	1
his	1
mustache,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
face,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
slept.	1
Nicholas	1
suddenly	1
moved	1
and	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
little	1
Andrew	1
shouted	1
from	1
outside	1
the	1
door:	1
"Papa!	1
Mamma's	1
standing	1
here!"	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
turned	1
pale	1
with	1
fright	1
and	1
made	1
signs	1
to	1
the	1
boy.	1
He	1
grew	1
silent,	1
and	1
quiet	1
ensued	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
terrible	1
to	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
She	1
knew	1
how	1
Nicholas	1
disliked	1
being	1
waked.	1
Then	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
she	1
heard	1
Nicholas	1
clearing	1
his	1
throat	1
again	1
and	1
stirring,	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
said	1
crossly:	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
get	1
a	1
moment's	1
peace....	1
Mary,	1
is	1
that	1
you?	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
bring	1
him	1
here?"	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
look	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
notice...	1
forgive	1
me..."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
coughed	1
and	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
boy	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
little	1
black-eyed	1
three-year-old	1
Natasha,	1
her	1
father's	1
pet,	1
having	1
learned	1
from	1
her	1
brother	1
that	1
Papa	1
was	1
asleep	1
and	1
Mamma	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
unobserved	1
by	1
her	1
mother.	1
The	1
dark-eyed	1
little	1
girl	1
boldly	1
opened	1
the	1
creaking	1
door,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sofa	1
with	1
energetic	1
steps	1
of	1
her	1
sturdy	1
little	1
legs,	1
and	1
having	1
examined	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
asleep	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
her,	1
rose	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
hand	1
which	1
lay	1
under	1
his	1
head.	1
Nicholas	1
turned	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
Natasha!"	1
came	1
Countess	1
Mary's	1
frightened	1
whisper	1
from	1
the	1
door.	1
"Papa	1
wants	1
to	1
sleep."	1
	1
"No,	1
Mamma,	1
he	1
doesn't	1
want	1
to	1
sleep,"	1
said	1
little	1
Natasha	1
with	1
conviction.	1
"He's	1
laughing."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
lowered	1
his	1
legs,	1
rose,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
	1
"Come	1
in,	1
Mary,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
She	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
him	1
following	1
me,"	1
she	1
said	1
timidly.	1
"I	1
just	1
looked	1
in."	1
	1
Holding	1
his	1
little	1
girl	1
with	1
one	1
arm,	1
Nicholas	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
and,	1
seeing	1
her	1
guilty	1
expression,	1
put	1
his	1
other	1
arm	1
around	1
her	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
hair.	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
kiss	1
Mamma?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Natasha	1
smiled	1
bashfully.	1
	1
"Again!"	1
she	1
commanded,	1
pointing	1
with	1
a	1
peremptory	1
gesture	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
placed	1
the	1
kiss.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
cross,"	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
replying	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
mind.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
how	1
unhappy,	1
how	1
lonely,	1
I	1
feel	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
like	1
that.	1
It	1
always	1
seems	1
to	1
me..."	1
	1
"Mary,	1
don't	1
talk	1
nonsense.	1
You	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself!"	1
he	1
said	1
gaily.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
can't	1
love	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
plain...	1
always...	1
and	1
now...	1
in	1
this	1
cond..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
absurd	1
you	1
are!	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
beauty	1
that	1
endears,	1
it's	1
love	1
that	1
makes	1
us	1
see	1
beauty.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
Malvinas	1
and	1
women	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
who	1
are	1
loved	1
for	1
their	1
beauty.	1
But	1
do	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
wife?	1
I	1
don't	1
love	1
her,	1
but...	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
put	1
it.	1
Without	1
you,	1
or	1
when	1
something	1
comes	1
between	1
us	1
like	1
this,	1
I	1
seem	1
lost	1
and	1
can't	1
do	1
anything.	1
Now	1
do	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
finger?	1
I	1
don't	1
love	1
it,	1
but	1
just	1
try	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
off!"	1
	1
"I'm	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
myself,	1
but	1
I	1
understand.	1
So	1
you're	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
me?"	1
	1
"Awfully	1
angry!"	1
he	1
said,	1
smiling	1
and	1
getting	1
up.	1
And	1
smoothing	1
his	1
hair	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
pace	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Mary,	1
what	1
I've	1
been	1
thinking?"	1
he	1
began,	1
immediately	1
thinking	1
aloud	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
presence	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
care.	1
A	1
thought	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
belonged	1
to	1
her	1
also.	1
And	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
persuade	1
Pierre	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
them	1
till	1
spring.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
listened	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
finished,	1
made	1
some	1
remark,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
turn	1
began	1
thinking	1
aloud.	1
Her	1
thoughts	1
were	1
about	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
her	1
already,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
French,	1
pointing	1
to	1
little	1
Natasha.	1
"You	1
reproach	1
us	1
women	1
with	1
being	1
illogical.	1
Here	1
is	1
our	1
logic.	1
I	1
say:	1
'Papa	1
wants	1
to	1
sleep!'	1
but	1
she	1
says,	1
'No,	1
he's	1
laughing.'	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
right,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
smile.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes."	1
And	1
Nicholas,	1
taking	1
his	1
little	1
daughter	1
in	1
his	1
strong	1
hand,	1
lifted	1
her	1
high,	1
placed	1
her	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
held	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
legs,	1
and	1
paced	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
her.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
carefree	1
happiness	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
both	1
father	1
and	1
daughter.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
unfair.	1
You	1
are	1
too	1
fond	1
of	1
this	1
one,"	1
his	1
wife	1
whispered	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?...	1
I	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
show..."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
pulley	1
and	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
anteroom,	1
as	1
if	1
someone	1
had	1
arrived.	1
	1
"Somebody	1
has	1
come."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
Pierre.	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
see,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
In	1
her	1
absence	1
Nicholas	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
little	1
daughter	1
a	1
gallop	1
round	1
the	1
room.	1
Out	1
of	1
breath,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
laughing	1
child	1
quickly	1
from	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
pressed	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
His	1
capers	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
dancing,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
child's	1
round	1
happy	1
little	1
face	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
like	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
taking	1
her	1
into	1
society	1
and	1
dancing	1
the	1
mazurka	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
old	1
father	1
had	1
danced	1
Daniel	1
Cooper	1
with	1
his	1
daughter.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
he,	1
it	1
is	1
he,	1
Nicholas!"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
re-entering	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later.	1
"Now	1
our	1
Natasha	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
life.	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
ecstasy,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
caught	1
it	1
for	1
having	1
stayed	1
away	1
so	1
long.	1
Well,	1
come	1
along	1
now,	1
quick,	1
quick!	1
It's	1
time	1
you	1
two	1
were	1
parted,"	1
she	1
added,	1
looking	1
smilingly	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
clung	1
to	1
her	1
father.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
out	1
holding	1
the	1
child	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
never,	1
never	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
happy,"	1
she	1
whispered	1
to	1
herself.	1
A	1
smile	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
face	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
sighed,	1
and	1
her	1
deep	1
eyes	1
expressed	1
a	1
quiet	1
sadness	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
felt,	1
through	1
her	1
happiness,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
sort	1
of	1
happiness	1
unattainable	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
involuntarily	1
thought	1
at	1
that	1
instant.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Natasha	1
had	1
married	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
spring	1
of	1
1813,	1
and	1
in	1
1820	1
already	1
had	1
three	1
daughters	1
besides	1
a	1
son	1
for	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
longed	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
nursing.	1
She	1
had	1
grown	1
stouter	1
and	1
broader,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
recognize	1
in	1
this	1
robust,	1
motherly	1
woman	1
the	1
slim,	1
lively	1
Natasha	1
of	1
former	1
days.	1
Her	1
features	1
were	1
more	1
defined	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
calm,	1
soft,	1
and	1
serene	1
expression.	1
In	1
her	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
ever-glowing	1
animation	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
burned	1
there	1
and	1
constituted	1
its	1
charm.	1
Now	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
body	1
were	1
often	1
all	1
that	1
one	1
saw,	1
and	1
her	1
soul	1
was	1
not	1
visible	1
at	1
all.	1
All	1
that	1
struck	1
the	1
eye	1
was	1
a	1
strong,	1
handsome,	1
and	1
fertile	1
woman.	1
The	1
old	1
fire	1
very	1
rarely	1
kindled	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
now.	1
That	1
happened	1
only	1
when,	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
that	1
day,	1
her	1
husband	1
returned	1
home,	1
or	1
a	1
sick	1
child	1
was	1
convalescent,	1
or	1
when	1
she	1
and	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
spoke	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
(she	1
never	1
mentioned	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
who	1
she	1
imagined	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
memory),	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
rare	1
occasions	1
when	1
something	1
happened	1
to	1
induce	1
her	1
to	1
sing,	1
a	1
practice	1
she	1
had	1
quite	1
abandoned	1
since	1
her	1
marriage.	1
At	1
the	1
rare	1
moments	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
fire	1
did	1
kindle	1
in	1
her	1
handsome,	1
fully	1
developed	1
body	1
she	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
attractive	1
than	1
in	1
former	1
days.	1
	1
Since	1
their	1
marriage	1
Natasha	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
lived	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
on	1
their	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
with	1
her	1
mother,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
in	1
Nicholas'	1
house.	1
The	1
young	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
was	1
not	1
often	1
seen	1
in	1
society,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
met	1
her	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
found	1
her	1
neither	1
attractive	1
nor	1
amiable.	1
Not	1
that	1
Natasha	1
liked	1
solitude--she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
she	1
liked	1
it	1
or	1
not,	1
she	1
even	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not--but	1
with	1
her	1
pregnancies,	1
her	1
confinements,	1
the	1
nursing	1
of	1
her	1
children,	1
and	1
sharing	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
life,	1
she	1
had	1
demands	1
on	1
her	1
time	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
satisfied	1
only	1
by	1
renouncing	1
society.	1
All	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
Natasha	1
before	1
her	1
marriage	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
as	1
at	1
something	1
extraordinary.	1
Only	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
with	1
her	1
maternal	1
instinct	1
had	1
realized	1
that	1
all	1
Natasha's	1
outbursts	1
had	1
been	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
need	1
of	1
children	1
and	1
a	1
husband--as	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
once	1
exclaimed	1
at	1
Otradnoe	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
fun	1
as	1
in	1
earnest--and	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
now	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
surprise	1
expressed	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
understood	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
she	1
kept	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
known	1
that	1
Natasha	1
would	1
make	1
an	1
exemplary	1
wife	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
"Only	1
she	1
lets	1
her	1
love	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
children	1
overflow	1
all	1
bounds,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
"so	1
that	1
it	1
even	1
becomes	1
absurd."	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
the	1
golden	1
rule	1
advocated	1
by	1
clever	1
folk,	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
which	1
says	1
that	1
a	1
girl	1
should	1
not	1
let	1
herself	1
go	1
when	1
she	1
marries,	1
should	1
not	1
neglect	1
her	1
accomplishments,	1
should	1
be	1
even	1
more	1
careful	1
of	1
her	1
appearance	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
unmarried,	1
and	1
should	1
fascinate	1
her	1
husband	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
before	1
he	1
became	1
her	1
husband.	1
Natasha	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
abandoned	1
all	1
her	1
witchery,	1
of	1
which	1
her	1
singing	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
unusually	1
powerful	1
part.	1
She	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
powerfully	1
seductive.	1
She	1
took	1
no	1
pains	1
with	1
her	1
manners	1
or	1
with	1
delicacy	1
of	1
speech,	1
or	1
with	1
her	1
toilet,	1
or	1
to	1
show	1
herself	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
her	1
most	1
becoming	1
attitudes,	1
or	1
to	1
avoid	1
inconveniencing	1
him	1
by	1
being	1
too	1
exacting.	1
She	1
acted	1
in	1
contradiction	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
rules.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
allurements	1
instinct	1
had	1
formerly	1
taught	1
her	1
to	1
use	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
merely	1
ridiculous	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
her	1
husband,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
given	1
herself	1
up	1
entirely--that	1
is,	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
soul,	1
leaving	1
no	1
corner	1
of	1
it	1
hidden	1
from	1
him.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
her	1
unity	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
not	1
maintained	1
by	1
the	1
poetic	1
feelings	1
that	1
had	1
attracted	1
him	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
by	1
something	1
else--indefinite	1
but	1
firm	1
as	1
the	1
bond	1
between	1
her	1
own	1
body	1
and	1
soul.	1
	1
To	1
fluff	1
out	1
her	1
curls,	1
put	1
on	1
fashionable	1
dresses,	1
and	1
sing	1
romantic	1
songs	1
to	1
fascinate	1
her	1
husband	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
as	1
strange	1
as	1
to	1
adorn	1
herself	1
to	1
attract	1
herself.	1
To	1
adorn	1
herself	1
for	1
others	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
been	1
agreeable--she	1
did	1
not	1
know--but	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
chief	1
reason	1
for	1
devoting	1
no	1
time	1
either	1
to	1
singing,	1
to	1
dress,	1
or	1
to	1
choosing	1
her	1
words	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
really	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
spare	1
for	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
man	1
has	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
becoming	1
completely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
a	1
subject	1
however	1
trivial	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
subject	1
so	1
trivial	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
grow	1
to	1
infinite	1
proportions	1
if	1
one's	1
entire	1
attention	1
is	1
devoted	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
subject	1
which	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
Natasha's	1
attention	1
was	1
her	1
family:	1
that	1
is,	1
her	1
husband	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
keep	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
belong	1
entirely	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
home,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
bear,	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
nurse,	1
and	1
bring	1
up.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
deeper	1
she	1
penetrated,	1
not	1
with	1
her	1
mind	1
only	1
but	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
soul,	1
her	1
whole	1
being,	1
into	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
absorbed	1
her,	1
the	1
larger	1
did	1
that	1
subject	1
grow	1
and	1
the	1
weaker	1
and	1
more	1
inadequate	1
did	1
her	1
powers	1
appear,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
concentrated	1
them	1
wholly	1
on	1
that	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
yet	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
accomplish	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
considered	1
necessary.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
then	1
as	1
now	1
conversations	1
and	1
discussions	1
about	1
women's	1
rights,	1
the	1
relations	1
of	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
and	1
their	1
freedom	1
and	1
rights,	1
though	1
these	1
themes	1
were	1
not	1
yet	1
termed	1
questions	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
now;	1
but	1
these	1
topics	1
were	1
not	1
merely	1
uninteresting	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
she	1
positively	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
them.	1
	1
These	1
questions,	1
then	1
as	1
now,	1
existed	1
only	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
marriage	1
but	1
the	1
pleasure	1
married	1
people	1
get	1
from	1
one	1
another,	1
that	1
is,	1
only	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
marriage	1
and	1
not	1
its	1
whole	1
significance,	1
which	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
family.	1
	1
Discussions	1
and	1
questions	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
which	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
greatest	1
gratification	1
from	1
one's	1
dinner,	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
now	1
exist	1
for	1
those	1
for	1
whom	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
a	1
dinner	1
is	1
the	1
nourishment	1
it	1
affords;	1
and	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
marriage	1
is	1
the	1
family.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
dinner	1
is	1
to	1
nourish	1
the	1
body,	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
eats	1
two	1
dinners	1
at	1
once	1
may	1
perhaps	1
get	1
more	1
enjoyment	1
but	1
will	1
not	1
attain	1
his	1
purpose,	1
for	1
his	1
stomach	1
will	1
not	1
digest	1
the	1
two	1
dinners.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
marriage	1
is	1
the	1
family,	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
wishes	1
to	1
have	1
many	1
wives	1
or	1
husbands	1
may	1
perhaps	1
obtain	1
much	1
pleasure,	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
family.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
food	1
is	1
nourishment	1
and	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
marriage	1
is	1
the	1
family,	1
the	1
whole	1
question	1
resolves	1
itself	1
into	1
not	1
eating	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
can	1
digest,	1
and	1
not	1
having	1
more	1
wives	1
or	1
husbands	1
than	1
are	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
family--that	1
is,	1
one	1
wife	1
or	1
one	1
husband.	1
Natasha	1
needed	1
a	1
husband.	1
A	1
husband	1
was	1
given	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
family.	1
And	1
she	1
not	1
only	1
saw	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
or	1
better	1
husband,	1
but	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
were	1
intent	1
on	1
serving	1
that	1
husband	1
and	1
family,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
imagining	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
if	1
things	1
were	1
different.	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
society	1
in	1
general,	1
but	1
prized	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
her	1
relatives--Countess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
her	1
brother,	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
Sonya.	1
She	1
valued	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
come	1
striding	1
disheveled	1
from	1
the	1
nursery	1
in	1
her	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
and	1
with	1
joyful	1
face	1
show	1
a	1
yellow	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
green	1
stain	1
on	1
baby's	1
napkin,	1
and	1
from	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
reassuring	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
baby	1
was	1
much	1
better.	1
	1
To	1
such	1
an	1
extent	1
had	1
Natasha	1
let	1
herself	1
go	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
she	1
dressed	1
and	1
did	1
her	1
hair,	1
her	1
ill-chosen	1
words,	1
and	1
her	1
jealousy--she	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
of	1
the	1
governess,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
woman,	1
pretty	1
or	1
plain-	1
-were	1
habitual	1
subjects	1
of	1
jest	1
to	1
those	1
about	1
her.	1
The	1
general	1
opinion	1
was	1
that	1
Pierre	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
wife's	1
thumb,	1
which	1
was	1
really	1
true.	1
From	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
married	1
life	1
Natasha	1
had	1
announced	1
her	1
demands.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
greatly	1
surprised	1
by	1
his	1
wife's	1
view,	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
perfectly	1
novel	1
one,	1
that	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
belonged	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
family.	1
His	1
wife's	1
demands	1
astonished	1
him,	1
but	1
they	1
also	1
flattered	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
submitted	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
subjection	1
consisted	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
dared	1
not	1
flirt	1
with,	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
even	1
speak	1
smilingly	1
to,	1
any	1
other	1
woman;	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
dine	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
as	1
a	1
pastime,	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
spend	1
money	1
on	1
a	1
whim,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
absent	1
himself	1
for	1
any	1
length	1
of	1
time,	1
except	1
on	1
business--in	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
included	1
his	1
intellectual	1
pursuits,	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
understand	1
but	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
attributed	1
great	1
importance.	1
To	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
this,	1
at	1
home	1
Pierre	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
regulate	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
chose.	1
At	1
home	1
Natasha	1
placed	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
household	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
occupied--that	1
is,	1
was	1
reading	1
or	1
writing	1
in	1
his	1
study.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
but	1
to	1
show	1
a	1
partiality	1
for	1
anything	1
to	1
get	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
liked	1
done	1
always.	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
express	1
a	1
wish	1
and	1
Natasha	1
would	1
jump	1
up	1
and	1
run	1
to	1
fulfill	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
entire	1
household	1
was	1
governed	1
according	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
supposed	1
orders,	1
that	1
is,	1
by	1
his	1
wishes	1
which	1
Natasha	1
tried	1
to	1
guess.	1
Their	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
place	1
of	1
residence,	1
their	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
ties,	1
Natasha's	1
occupations,	1
the	1
children's	1
upbringing,	1
were	1
all	1
selected	1
not	1
merely	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
expressed	1
wishes,	1
but	1
to	1
what	1
Natasha	1
from	1
the	1
thoughts	1
he	1
expressed	1
in	1
conversation	1
supposed	1
his	1
wishes	1
to	1
be.	1
And	1
she	1
deduced	1
the	1
essentials	1
of	1
his	1
wishes	1
quite	1
correctly,	1
and	1
having	1
once	1
arrived	1
at	1
them	1
clung	1
to	1
them	1
tenaciously.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
wanted	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
mind	1
she	1
would	1
fight	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
weapons.	1
	1
Thus	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
trouble	1
ever	1
memorable	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
child	1
who	1
was	1
delicate,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
three	1
times	1
and	1
Natasha	1
fell	1
ill	1
from	1
despair,	1
Pierre	1
one	1
day	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
Rousseau's	1
view,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
quite	1
agreed,	1
that	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
wet	1
nurse	1
is	1
unnatural	1
and	1
harmful.	1
When	1
her	1
next	1
baby	1
was	1
born,	1
despite	1
the	1
opposition	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
the	1
doctors,	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
himself--	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
vigorously	1
opposed	1
to	1
her	1
nursing	1
her	1
baby	1
herself,	1
a	1
thing	1
then	1
unheard	1
of	1
and	1
considered	1
injurious--she	1
insisted	1
on	1
having	1
her	1
own	1
way,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
nursed	1
all	1
her	1
babies	1
herself.	1
	1
It	1
very	1
often	1
happened	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
irritation	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
dispute,	1
but	1
long	1
afterwards	1
Pierre	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
and	1
delight	1
would	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
ideas	1
and	1
actions	1
the	1
very	1
thought	1
against	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
argued,	1
but	1
divested	1
of	1
everything	1
superfluous	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
dispute	1
he	1
had	1
added	1
when	1
expressing	1
his	1
opinion.	1
	1
After	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
marriage	1
Pierre	1
had	1
the	1
joyous	1
and	1
firm	1
consciousness	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
reflected	1
in	1
his	1
wife.	1
He	1
felt	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
bad	1
within	1
himself	1
inextricably	1
mingled	1
and	1
overlapping.	1
But	1
only	1
what	1
was	1
really	1
good	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
reflected	1
in	1
his	1
wife,	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
good	1
was	1
rejected.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
logical	1
reasoning	1
but	1
was	1
a	1
direct	1
and	1
mysterious	1
reflection.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Two	1
months	1
previously	1
when	1
Pierre	1
was	1
already	1
staying	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Theodore,	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
confer	1
on	1
some	1
important	1
questions	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
discussed	1
there	1
by	1
a	1
society	1
of	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
founders.	1
	1
On	1
reading	1
that	1
letter	1
(she	1
always	1
read	1
her	1
husband's	1
letters)	1
Natasha	1
herself	1
suggested	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
feel	1
his	1
absence	1
very	1
acutely.	1
She	1
attributed	1
immense	1
importance	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
husband's	1
intellectual	1
and	1
abstract	1
interests	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
them,	1
and	1
she	1
always	1
dreaded	1
being	1
a	1
hindrance	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
matters.	1
To	1
Pierre's	1
timid	1
look	1
of	1
inquiry	1
after	1
reading	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
replied	1
by	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
to	1
fix	1
a	1
definite	1
date	1
for	1
his	1
return.	1
He	1
was	1
given	1
four	1
weeks'	1
leave	1
of	1
absence.	1
	1
Ever	1
since	1
that	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
had	1
expired,	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
fortnight	1
before,	1
Natasha	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
constant	1
state	1
of	1
alarm,	1
depression,	1
and	1
irritability.	1
	1
Denisov,	1
now	1
a	1
general	1
on	1
the	1
retired	1
list	1
and	1
much	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
affairs,	1
had	1
arrived	1
during	1
that	1
fortnight.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha	1
with	1
sorrow	1
and	1
surprise	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
bad	1
likeness	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
once	1
dear.	1
A	1
dull,	1
dejected	1
look,	1
random	1
replies,	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
nursery	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
former	1
enchantress.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sad	1
and	1
irritable	1
all	1
that	1
time,	1
especially	1
when	1
her	1
mother,	1
her	1
brother,	1
Sonya,	1
or	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
in	1
their	1
efforts	1
to	1
console	1
her	1
tried	1
to	1
excuse	1
Pierre	1
and	1
suggested	1
reasons	1
for	1
his	1
delay	1
in	1
returning.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
nonsense,	1
all	1
rubbish--those	1
discussions	1
which	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
idiotic	1
societies!"	1
Natasha	1
declared	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
affairs	1
in	1
the	1
immense	1
importance	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
firmly	1
believed.	1
	1
And	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
to	1
nurse	1
Petya,	1
her	1
only	1
boy.	1
No	1
one	1
else	1
could	1
tell	1
her	1
anything	1
so	1
comforting	1
or	1
so	1
reasonable	1
as	1
this	1
little	1
three-month-old	1
creature	1
when	1
he	1
lay	1
at	1
her	1
breast	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
snuffling	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
nose.	1
That	1
creature	1
said:	1
"You	1
are	1
angry,	1
you	1
are	1
jealous,	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
out,	1
you	1
are	1
afraid--but	1
here	1
am	1
I!	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
he..."	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
unanswerable.	1
It	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
true.	1
	1
During	1
that	1
fortnight	1
of	1
anxiety	1
Natasha	1
resorted	1
to	1
the	1
baby	1
for	1
comfort	1
so	1
often,	1
and	1
fussed	1
over	1
him	1
so	1
much,	1
that	1
she	1
overfed	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
ill.	1
She	1
was	1
terrified	1
by	1
his	1
illness,	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
she	1
needed.	1
While	1
attending	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
bore	1
the	1
anxiety	1
about	1
her	1
husband	1
more	1
easily.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
nursing	1
her	1
boy	1
when	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
sleigh	1
was	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
nurse--knowing	1
how	1
to	1
please	1
her	1
mistress--	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
inaudibly	1
but	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
face.	1
	1
"Has	1
he	1
come?"	1
Natasha	1
asked	1
quickly	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
afraid	1
to	1
move	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
rouse	1
the	1
dozing	1
baby.	1
	1
"He's	1
come,	1
ma'am,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
nurse.	1
	1
The	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
and	1
her	1
feet	1
involuntarily	1
moved,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
jump	1
up	1
and	1
run	1
out.	1
The	1
baby	1
again	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her.	1
"You're	1
here?"	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying,	1
and	1
again	1
lazily	1
smacked	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
Cautiously	1
withdrawing	1
her	1
breast,	1
Natasha	1
rocked	1
him	1
a	1
little,	1
handed	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
nurse,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
toward	1
the	1
door.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
she	1
stopped	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
conscience	1
reproached	1
her	1
for	1
having	1
in	1
her	1
joy	1
left	1
the	1
child	1
too	1
soon,	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
round.	1
The	1
nurse	1
with	1
raised	1
elbows	1
was	1
lifting	1
the	1
infant	1
over	1
the	1
rail	1
of	1
his	1
cot.	1
	1
"Go,	1
ma'am!	1
Don't	1
worry,	1
go!"	1
she	1
whispered,	1
smiling,	1
with	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
familiarity	1
that	1
grows	1
up	1
between	1
a	1
nurse	1
and	1
her	1
mistress.	1
	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
with	1
light	1
footsteps	1
to	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
into	1
the	1
dancing	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
pipe,	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
recognized	1
the	1
old	1
Natasha.	1
A	1
flood	1
of	1
brilliant,	1
joyful	1
light	1
poured	1
from	1
her	1
transfigured	1
face.	1
	1
"He's	1
come!"	1
she	1
exclaimed	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
past,	1
and	1
Denisov	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
delighted	1
that	1
Pierre,	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
care	1
for,	1
had	1
returned.	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
vestibule	1
Natasha	1
saw	1
a	1
tall	1
figure	1
in	1
a	1
fur	1
coat	1
unwinding	1
his	1
scarf.	1
"It's	1
he!	1
It's	1
really	1
he!	1
He	1
has	1
come!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
rushing	1
at	1
him	1
embraced	1
him,	1
pressed	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
her	1
breast,	1
and	1
then	1
pushed	1
him	1
back	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
ruddy,	1
happy	1
face,	1
covered	1
with	1
hoarfrost.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
he,	1
happy	1
and	1
contented..."	1
	1
Then	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
remembered	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
suspense	1
she	1
had	1
experienced	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
the	1
joy	1
that	1
had	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
face	1
vanished;	1
she	1
frowned	1
and	1
overwhelmed	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
torrent	1
of	1
reproaches	1
and	1
angry	1
words.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
are	1
pleased,	1
you've	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
time....	1
But	1
what	1
about	1
me?	1
You	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
have	1
shown	1
consideration	1
for	1
the	1
children.	1
I	1
am	1
nursing	1
and	1
my	1
milk	1
was	1
spoiled....	1
Petya	1
was	1
at	1
death's	1
door.	1
But	1
you	1
were	1
enjoying	1
yourself.	1
Yes,	1
enjoying..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
come	1
sooner;	1
he	1
knew	1
this	1
outburst	1
was	1
unseemly	1
and	1
would	1
blow	1
over	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two;	1
above	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
bright	1
and	1
happy.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
smile	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
of	1
doing	1
so.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
piteous,	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
bent	1
down.	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
not,	1
on	1
my	1
honor.	1
But	1
how	1
is	1
Petya?"	1
	1
"All	1
right	1
now.	1
Come	1
along!	1
I	1
wonder	1
you're	1
not	1
ashamed!	1
If	1
only	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
like	1
without	1
you,	1
how	1
I	1
suffered!"	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
well?"	1
	1
"Come,	1
come!"	1
she	1
said,	1
not	1
letting	1
go	1
of	1
his	1
arm.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
rooms.	1
	1
When	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
Pierre	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
holding	1
his	1
baby	1
son,	1
who	1
was	1
again	1
awake,	1
on	1
his	1
huge	1
right	1
palm	1
and	1
dandling	1
him.	1
A	1
blissful	1
bright	1
smile	1
was	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
baby's	1
broad	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
toothless	1
open	1
mouth.	1
The	1
storm	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
over	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
bright,	1
joyous	1
sunshine	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
gazed	1
tenderly	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
child.	1
	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
talked	1
everything	1
well	1
over	1
with	1
Prince	1
Theodore?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
capitally."	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
he	1
holds	1
it	1
up."	1
(She	1
meant	1
the	1
baby's	1
head.)	1
"But	1
how	1
he	1
did	1
frighten	1
me...	1
You've	1
seen	1
the	1
princess?	1
Is	1
it	1
true	1
she's	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
just	1
fancy..."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
came	1
in.	1
Pierre	1
with	1
the	1
baby	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
stooped,	1
kissed	1
them,	1
and	1
replied	1
to	1
their	1
inquiries.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
much	1
that	1
was	1
interesting	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
discussed,	1
the	1
baby	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
cap	1
on	1
its	1
unsteady	1
head	1
evidently	1
absorbed	1
all	1
his	1
attention.	1
	1
"How	1
sweet!"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
looking	1
at	1
and	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
baby.	1
"Now,	1
Nicholas,"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
"I	1
can't	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
don't	1
see	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
these	1
delicious	1
marvels."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
and	1
can't,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas,	1
looking	1
coldly	1
at	1
the	1
baby.	1
"A	1
lump	1
of	1
flesh.	1
Come	1
along,	1
Pierre!"	1
	1
"And	1
yet	1
he's	1
such	1
an	1
affectionate	1
father,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
vindicating	1
her	1
husband,	1
"but	1
only	1
after	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
year	1
old	1
or	1
so..."	1
	1
"Now,	1
Pierre	1
nurses	1
them	1
splendidly,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"He	1
says	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
just	1
made	1
for	1
a	1
baby's	1
seat.	1
Just	1
look!"	1
	1
"Only	1
not	1
for	1
this..."	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
a	1
laugh,	1
and	1
shifting	1
the	1
baby	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
nurse.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
As	1
in	1
every	1
large	1
household,	1
there	1
were	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
several	1
perfectly	1
distinct	1
worlds	1
which	1
merged	1
into	1
one	1
harmonious	1
whole,	1
though	1
each	1
retained	1
its	1
own	1
peculiarities	1
and	1
made	1
concessions	1
to	1
the	1
others.	1
Every	1
event,	1
joyful	1
or	1
sad,	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
was	1
important	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
worlds,	1
but	1
each	1
had	1
its	1
own	1
special	1
reasons	1
to	1
rejoice	1
or	1
grieve	1
over	1
that	1
occurrence	1
independently	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
For	1
instance,	1
Pierre's	1
return	1
was	1
a	1
joyful	1
and	1
important	1
event	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so.	1
	1
The	1
servants--the	1
most	1
reliable	1
judges	1
of	1
their	1
masters	1
because	1
they	1
judge	1
not	1
by	1
their	1
conversation	1
or	1
expressions	1
of	1
feeling	1
but	1
by	1
their	1
acts	1
and	1
way	1
of	1
life--were	1
glad	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
return	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
Count	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
cease	1
going	1
every	1
day	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
estate,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
better	1
spirits	1
and	1
temper,	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
they	1
would	1
all	1
receive	1
handsome	1
presents	1
for	1
the	1
holidays.	1
	1
The	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
governesses	1
were	1
glad	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
return	1
because	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
drew	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
social	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
as	1
he	1
did.	1
He	1
alone	1
could	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord	1
that	1
ecossaise	1
(his	1
only	1
piece)	1
to	1
which,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
all	1
possible	1
dances	1
could	1
be	1
danced,	1
and	1
they	1
felt	1
sure	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
presents	1
for	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
Young	1
Nicholas,	1
now	1
a	1
slim	1
lad	1
of	1
fifteen,	1
delicate	1
and	1
intelligent,	1
with	1
curly	1
light-brown	1
hair	1
and	1
beautiful	1
eyes,	1
was	1
delighted	1
because	1
Uncle	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
rapturous	1
and	1
passionate	1
affection.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
instilled	1
into	1
him	1
this	1
love	1
for	1
Pierre	1
whom	1
he	1
saw	1
only	1
occasionally.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
utmost	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
love	1
her	1
husband	1
as	1
she	1
loved	1
him,	1
and	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
love	1
his	1
uncle,	1
but	1
loved	1
him	1
with	1
just	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
contempt.	1
Pierre,	1
however,	1
he	1
adored.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
hussar	1
or	1
a	1
Knight	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
like	1
his	1
uncle	1
Nicholas;	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
learned,	1
wise,	1
and	1
kind	1
like	1
Pierre.	1
In	1
Pierre's	1
presence	1
his	1
face	1
always	1
shone	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
flushed	1
and	1
was	1
breathless	1
when	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
miss	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
he	1
uttered,	1
and	1
would	1
afterwards,	1
with	1
Dessalles	1
or	1
by	1
himself,	1
recall	1
and	1
reconsider	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
everything	1
Pierre	1
had	1
said.	1
Pierre's	1
past	1
life	1
and	1
his	1
unhappiness	1
prior	1
to	1
1812	1
(of	1
which	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
vague	1
poetic	1
picture	1
from	1
some	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
overheard),	1
his	1
adventures	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
his	1
captivity,	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
(of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
Pierre),	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha	1
(of	1
whom	1
the	1
lad	1
was	1
also	1
particularly	1
fond),	1
and	1
especially	1
Pierre's	1
friendship	1
with	1
the	1
father	1
whom	1
Nicholas	1
could	1
not	1
remember--all	1
this	1
made	1
Pierre	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
a	1
hero	1
and	1
a	1
saint.	1
	1
From	1
broken	1
remarks	1
about	1
Natasha	1
and	1
his	1
father,	1
from	1
the	1
emotion	1
with	1
which	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
of	1
that	1
dead	1
father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
careful,	1
reverent	1
tenderness	1
with	1
which	1
Natasha	1
spoke	1
of	1
him,	1
the	1
boy,	1
who	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
guess	1
what	1
love	1
is,	1
derived	1
the	1
notion	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
loved	1
Natasha	1
and	1
when	1
dying	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
friend.	1
But	1
the	1
father	1
whom	1
the	1
boy	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
divinity	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
pictured,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
never	1
thought	1
without	1
a	1
swelling	1
heart	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
sadness	1
and	1
rapture.	1
So	1
the	1
boy	1
also	1
was	1
happy	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
arrived.	1
	1
The	1
guests	1
welcomed	1
Pierre	1
because	1
he	1
always	1
helped	1
to	1
enliven	1
and	1
unite	1
any	1
company	1
he	1
was	1
in.	1
	1
The	1
grown-up	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
his	1
wife,	1
were	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
back	1
a	1
friend	1
whose	1
presence	1
made	1
life	1
run	1
more	1
smoothly	1
and	1
peacefully.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
ladies	1
were	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
presents	1
he	1
brought	1
them,	1
and	1
especially	1
that	1
Natasha	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
herself	1
again.	1
	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
the	1
different	1
outlooks	1
of	1
these	1
various	1
worlds	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
satisfy	1
all	1
their	1
expectations.	1
	1
Though	1
the	1
most	1
absent-minded	1
and	1
forgetful	1
of	1
men,	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
list	1
his	1
wife	1
drew	1
up,	1
had	1
now	1
bought	1
everything,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
his	1
mother--and	1
brother-in-law's	1
commissions,	1
nor	1
the	1
dress	1
material	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
Belova,	1
nor	1
toys	1
for	1
his	1
wife's	1
nephews.	1
In	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
marriage	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
should	1
expect	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
to	1
procure	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
undertook	1
to	1
buy,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
aback	1
by	1
her	1
serious	1
annoyance	1
when	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
trip	1
he	1
forgot	1
everything.	1
But	1
in	1
time	1
he	1
grew	1
used	1
to	1
this	1
demand.	1
Knowing	1
that	1
Natasha	1
asked	1
nothing	1
for	1
herself,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
commissions	1
for	1
others	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
offered	1
to	1
undertake	1
them,	1
he	1
now	1
found	1
an	1
unexpected	1
and	1
childlike	1
pleasure	1
in	1
this	1
purchase	1
of	1
presents	1
for	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
never	1
forgot	1
anything.	1
If	1
he	1
now	1
incurred	1
Natasha's	1
censure	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
for	1
buying	1
too	1
many	1
and	1
too	1
expensive	1
things.	1
To	1
her	1
other	1
defects	1
(as	1
most	1
people	1
thought	1
them,	1
but	1
which	1
to	1
Pierre	1
were	1
qualities)	1
of	1
untidiness	1
and	1
neglect	1
of	1
herself,	1
she	1
now	1
added	1
stinginess.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Pierre	1
began	1
life	1
as	1
a	1
family	1
man	1
on	1
a	1
footing	1
entailing	1
heavy	1
expenditure,	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
that	1
he	1
spent	1
only	1
half	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
affairs--which	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
disorder	1
of	1
late,	1
chiefly	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
wife's	1
debts--had	1
begun	1
to	1
improve.	1
	1
Life	1
was	1
cheaper	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
circumscribed:	1
that	1
most	1
expensive	1
luxury,	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
changed	1
at	1
any	1
moment,	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
his	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
wish	1
for	1
it.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
settled	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
till	1
death	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
change	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
power,	1
and	1
so	1
that	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
proved	1
economical.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
merry,	1
smiling	1
face	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sorting	1
his	1
purchases.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
this?"	1
said	1
he,	1
unrolling	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
stuff	1
like	1
a	1
shopman.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
on	1
her	1
lap,	1
turned	1
her	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
swiftly	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
showed	1
her.	1
	1
"That's	1
for	1
Belova?	1
Excellent!"	1
She	1
felt	1
the	1
quality	1
of	1
the	1
material.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
ruble	1
an	1
arshin,	1
I	1
suppose?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
price.	1
	1
"Too	1
dear!"	1
Natasha	1
remarked.	1
"How	1
pleased	1
the	1
children	1
will	1
be	1
and	1
Mamma	1
too!	1
Only	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
bought	1
me	1
this,"	1
she	1
added,	1
unable	1
to	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
as	1
she	1
gazed	1
admiringly	1
at	1
a	1
gold	1
comb	1
set	1
with	1
pearls,	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
then	1
just	1
coming	1
into	1
fashion.	1
	1
"Adele	1
tempted	1
me:	1
she	1
kept	1
on	1
telling	1
me	1
to	1
buy	1
it,"	1
returned	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"When	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
wear	1
it?"	1
and	1
Natasha	1
stuck	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
coil	1
of	1
hair.	1
"When	1
I	1
take	1
little	1
Masha	1
into	1
society?	1
Perhaps	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
fashionable	1
again	1
by	1
then.	1
Well,	1
let's	1
go	1
now."	1
	1
And	1
collecting	1
the	1
presents	1
they	1
went	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
countess'	1
rooms.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
companion	1
Belova,	1
playing	1
grand-	1
patience	1
as	1
usual,	1
when	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Natasha	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
parcels	1
under	1
their	1
arms.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
now	1
over	1
sixty,	1
was	1
quite	1
gray,	1
and	1
wore	1
a	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
frill	1
that	1
surrounded	1
her	1
face.	1
Her	1
face	1
had	1
shriveled,	1
her	1
upper	1
lip	1
had	1
sunk	1
in,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
dim.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
husband	1
in	1
such	1
rapid	1
succession,	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
a	1
being	1
accidentally	1
forgotten	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
left	1
without	1
aim	1
or	1
object	1
for	1
her	1
existence.	1
She	1
ate,	1
drank,	1
slept,	1
or	1
kept	1
awake,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
live.	1
Life	1
gave	1
her	1
no	1
new	1
impressions.	1
She	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
from	1
life	1
but	1
tranquillity,	1
and	1
that	1
tranquillity	1
only	1
death	1
could	1
give	1
her.	1
But	1
until	1
death	1
came	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
living,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
use	1
her	1
vital	1
forces.	1
A	1
peculiarity	1
one	1
sees	1
in	1
very	1
young	1
children	1
and	1
very	1
old	1
people	1
was	1
particularly	1
evident	1
in	1
her.	1
Her	1
life	1
had	1
no	1
external	1
aims--only	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
exercise	1
her	1
various	1
functions	1
and	1
inclinations	1
was	1
apparent.	1
She	1
had	1
to	1
eat,	1
sleep,	1
think,	1
speak,	1
weep,	1
work,	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
her	1
anger,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
merely	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
stomach,	1
a	1
brain,	1
muscles,	1
nerves,	1
and	1
a	1
liver.	1
She	1
did	1
these	1
things	1
not	1
under	1
any	1
external	1
impulse	1
as	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
vigor	1
of	1
life	1
do,	1
when	1
behind	1
the	1
purpose	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
strive	1
that	1
of	1
exercising	1
their	1
functions	1
remains	1
unnoticed.	1
She	1
talked	1
only	1
because	1
she	1
physically	1
needed	1
to	1
exercise	1
her	1
tongue	1
and	1
lungs.	1
She	1
cried	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
does,	1
because	1
her	1
nose	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
cleared,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
What	1
for	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
full	1
vigor	1
is	1
an	1
aim	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
evidently	1
merely	1
a	1
pretext.	1
	1
Thus	1
in	1
the	1
morning--especially	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
eaten	1
anything	1
rich	1
the	1
day	1
before--she	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
of	1
being	1
angry	1
and	1
would	1
choose	1
as	1
the	1
handiest	1
pretext	1
Belova's	1
deafness.	1
	1
She	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
tone	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
a	1
little	1
warmer	1
today,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
she	1
would	1
murmur.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
Belova	1
replied:	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
they've	1
come,"	1
she	1
would	1
mutter	1
angrily:	1
"O	1
Lord!	1
How	1
stupid	1
and	1
deaf	1
she	1
is!"	1
	1
Another	1
pretext	1
would	1
be	1
her	1
snuff,	1
which	1
would	1
seem	1
too	1
dry	1
or	1
too	1
damp	1
or	1
not	1
rubbed	1
fine	1
enough.	1
After	1
these	1
fits	1
of	1
irritability	1
her	1
face	1
would	1
grow	1
yellow,	1
and	1
her	1
maids	1
knew	1
by	1
infallible	1
symptoms	1
when	1
Belova	1
would	1
again	1
be	1
deaf,	1
the	1
snuff	1
damp,	1
and	1
the	1
countess'	1
face	1
yellow.	1
Just	1
as	1
she	1
needed	1
to	1
work	1
off	1
her	1
spleen	1
so	1
she	1
had	1
sometimes	1
to	1
exercise	1
her	1
still-existing	1
faculty	1
of	1
thinking--and	1
the	1
pretext	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
patience.	1
When	1
she	1
needed	1
to	1
cry,	1
the	1
deceased	1
count	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
pretext.	1
When	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
agitated,	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
health	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
pretext,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
speak	1
spitefully,	1
the	1
pretext	1
would	1
be	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
When	1
her	1
vocal	1
organs	1
needed	1
exercise,	1
which	1
was	1
usually	1
toward	1
seven	1
o'clock	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
an	1
after-dinner	1
rest	1
in	1
a	1
darkened	1
room,	1
the	1
pretext	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
retelling	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
stories	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
audience.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
lady's	1
condition	1
was	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
household	1
though	1
no	1
one	1
ever	1
spoke	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
made	1
every	1
possible	1
effort	1
to	1
satisfy	1
her	1
needs.	1
Only	1
by	1
a	1
rare	1
glance	1
exchanged	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
smile	1
between	1
Nicholas,	1
Pierre,	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
was	1
the	1
common	1
understanding	1
of	1
her	1
condition	1
expressed.	1
	1
But	1
those	1
glances	1
expressed	1
something	1
more:	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
played	1
her	1
part	1
in	1
life,	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
now	1
saw	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
whole	1
self,	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
become	1
like	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
glad	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
her,	1
to	1
restrain	1
themselves	1
for	1
this	1
once	1
precious	1
being	1
formerly	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
as	1
themselves,	1
but	1
now	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied.	1
"Memento	1
mori,"	1
said	1
these	1
glances.	1
	1
Only	1
the	1
really	1
heartless,	1
the	1
stupid	1
ones	1
of	1
that	1
household,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
failed	1
to	1
understand	1
this	1
and	1
avoided	1
her.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
customary	1
states	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
needed	1
the	1
mental	1
exertion	1
of	1
playing	1
patience,	1
and	1
so--though	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
she	1
greeted	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
always	1
used	1
when	1
Pierre	1
or	1
her	1
son	1
returned	1
after	1
an	1
absence:	1
"High	1
time,	1
my	1
dear,	1
high	1
time!	1
We	1
were	1
all	1
weary	1
of	1
waiting	1
for	1
you.	1
Well,	1
thank	1
God!"	1
and	1
received	1
her	1
presents	1
with	1
another	1
customary	1
remark:	1
"It's	1
not	1
the	1
gift	1
that's	1
precious,	1
my	1
dear,	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
an	1
old	1
woman..."--yet	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
pleased	1
by	1
Pierre's	1
arrival	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
when	1
it	1
diverted	1
her	1
attention	1
from	1
the	1
unfinished	1
game.	1
	1
She	1
finished	1
her	1
game	1
of	1
patience	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
examined	1
the	1
presents.	1
They	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
box	1
for	1
cards,	1
of	1
splendid	1
workmanship,	1
a	1
bright-	1
blue	1
Sevres	1
tea	1
cup	1
with	1
shepherdesses	1
depicted	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
lid,	1
and	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
the	1
count's	1
portrait	1
on	1
the	1
lid	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
had	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
miniaturist	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
long	1
wished	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
box,	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
cry	1
just	1
then	1
she	1
glanced	1
indifferently	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
attention	1
chiefly	1
to	1
the	1
box	1
for	1
cards.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
have	1
cheered	1
me	1
up,"	1
said	1
she	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did.	1
"But	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
brought	1
yourself	1
back--for	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
anything	1
like	1
it,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
your	1
wife	1
a	1
scolding!	1
What	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her?	1
She	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
mad	1
woman	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
away.	1
Doesn't	1
see	1
anything,	1
doesn't	1
remember	1
anything,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
repeating	1
her	1
usual	1
phrases.	1
"Look,	1
Anna	1
Timofeevna,"	1
she	1
added	1
to	1
her	1
companion,	1
"see	1
what	1
a	1
box	1
for	1
cards	1
my	1
son	1
has	1
brought	1
us!"	1
	1
Belova	1
admired	1
the	1
presents	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
her	1
dress	1
material.	1
	1
Though	1
Pierre,	1
Natasha,	1
Nicholas,	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Denisov	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
discuss	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
countess--not	1
that	1
anything	1
was	1
hidden	1
from	1
her,	1
but	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
dropped	1
so	1
far	1
behindhand	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
they	1
begun	1
to	1
converse	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
answer	1
inopportune	1
questions	1
and	1
to	1
repeat	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
her	1
many	1
times:	1
that	1
so-and-so	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
so-and-so	1
was	1
married,	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
again	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
remember--yet	1
they	1
sat	1
at	1
tea	1
round	1
the	1
samovar	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
from	1
habit,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
answered	1
the	1
countess'	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
aged	1
and	1
whether	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
Alexeevna	1
had	1
sent	1
greetings	1
and	1
still	1
thought	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
other	1
matters	1
that	1
interested	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
indifferent.	1
	1
Conversation	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
interesting	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
yet	1
unavoidable,	1
continued	1
all	1
through	1
teatime.	1
All	1
the	1
grown-up	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
assembled	1
near	1
the	1
round	1
tea	1
table	1
at	1
which	1
Sonya	1
presided	1
beside	1
the	1
samovar.	1
The	1
children	1
with	1
their	1
tutors	1
and	1
governesses	1
had	1
had	1
tea	1
and	1
their	1
voices	1
were	1
audible	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
At	1
tea	1
all	1
sat	1
in	1
their	1
accustomed	1
places:	1
Nicholas	1
beside	1
the	1
stove	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
table	1
where	1
his	1
tea	1
was	1
handed	1
to	1
him;	1
Milka,	1
the	1
old	1
gray	1
borzoi	1
bitch	1
(daughter	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
Milka),	1
with	1
a	1
quite	1
gray	1
face	1
and	1
large	1
black	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
more	1
prominent	1
than	1
ever,	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
armchair	1
beside	1
him;	1
Denisov,	1
whose	1
curly	1
hair,	1
mustache,	1
and	1
whiskers	1
had	1
turned	1
half	1
gray,	1
sat	1
beside	1
countess	1
Mary	1
with	1
his	1
general's	1
tunic	1
unbuttoned;	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
between	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
countess.	1
He	1
spoke	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
knew	1
might	1
interest	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
understand.	1
He	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
external	1
social	1
events	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
formed	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
her	1
contemporaries	1
and	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
a	1
real,	1
living,	1
and	1
distinct	1
group,	1
but	1
who	1
were	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
scattered	1
about	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
like	1
herself	1
were	1
garnering	1
the	1
last	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
harvests	1
they	1
had	1
sown	1
in	1
earlier	1
years.	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
those	1
contemporaries	1
of	1
hers	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
serious	1
and	1
real	1
society.	1
Natasha	1
saw	1
by	1
Pierre's	1
animation	1
that	1
his	1
visit	1
had	1
been	1
interesting	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
but	1
dare	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
countess.	1
Denisov,	1
not	1
being	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
Pierre's	1
caution	1
and	1
being,	1
as	1
a	1
malcontent,	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
occurring	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
kept	1
urging	1
Pierre	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
about	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
Semenovsk	1
regiment,	1
then	1
about	1
Arakcheev,	1
and	1
then	1
about	1
the	1
Bible	1
Society.	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
Pierre	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Natasha	1
always	1
brought	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
Prince	1
Ivan	1
and	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
Alexeevna.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
idiocy--Gossner	1
and	1
Tatawinova?"	1
Denisov	1
asked.	1
"Is	1
that	1
weally	1
still	1
going	1
on?"	1
	1
	1
"Going	1
on?"	1
Pierre	1
exclaimed.	1
"Why	1
more	1
than	1
ever!	1
The	1
Bible	1
Society	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
government	1
now!"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
that,	1
mon	1
cher	1
ami?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess,	1
who	1
had	1
finished	1
her	1
tea	1
and	1
evidently	1
needed	1
a	1
pretext	1
for	1
being	1
angry	1
after	1
her	1
meal.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
saying	1
about	1
the	1
government?	1
I	1
don't	1
understand."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know,	1
Maman,"	1
Nicholas	1
interposed,	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
translate	1
things	1
into	1
his	1
mother's	1
language,	1
"Prince	1
Alexander	1
Golitsyn	1
has	1
founded	1
a	1
society	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
has	1
great	1
influence,	1
they	1
say."	1
	1
"Arakcheev	1
and	1
Golitsyn,"	1
incautiously	1
remarked	1
Pierre,	1
"are	1
now	1
the	1
whole	1
government!	1
And	1
what	1
a	1
government!	1
They	1
see	1
treason	1
everywhere	1
and	1
are	1
afraid	1
of	1
everything."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
Prince	1
Alexander	1
to	1
blame?	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
estimable	1
man.	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
Mary	1
Antonovna's,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
tone;	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
offended	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
remained	1
silent,	1
she	1
went	1
on:	1
"Nowadays	1
everyone	1
finds	1
fault.	1
A	1
Gospel	1
Society!	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
harm	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
that?"	1
and	1
she	1
rose	1
(everybody	1
else	1
got	1
up	1
too)	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
severe	1
expression	1
sailed	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
melancholy	1
silence	1
that	1
followed	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
children's	1
voices	1
and	1
laughter	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
Evidently	1
some	1
jolly	1
excitement	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
there.	1
	1
"Finished,	1
finished!"	1
little	1
Natasha's	1
gleeful	1
yell	1
rose	1
above	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
Pierre	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
(Natasha	1
he	1
never	1
lost	1
sight	1
of)	1
and	1
smiled	1
happily.	1
	1
"That's	1
delightful	1
music!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"It	1
means	1
that	1
Anna	1
Makarovna	1
has	1
finished	1
her	1
stocking,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I'll	1
go	1
and	1
see,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
jumping	1
up.	1
"You	1
know,"	1
he	1
added,	1
stopping	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
"why	1
I'm	1
especially	1
fond	1
of	1
that	1
music?	1
It	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
tells	1
me	1
all	1
is	1
well.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
driving	1
here	1
today,	1
the	1
nearer	1
I	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
more	1
anxious	1
I	1
grew.	1
As	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
anteroom	1
I	1
heard	1
Andrusha's	1
peals	1
of	1
laughter	1
and	1
that	1
meant	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
well."	1
	1
"I	1
know!	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
feeling,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"But	1
I	1
mustn't	1
go	1
there--	1
those	1
stockings	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
surprise	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
and	1
laughter	1
grew	1
still	1
louder.	1
	1
"Come,	1
Anna	1
Makarovna,"	1
Pierre's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
saying,	1
"come	1
here	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
'One,	1
two,'	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
'three'...	1
You	1
stand	1
here,	1
and	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
arms--well	1
now!	1
One,	1
two!..."	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
a	1
silence	1
followed:	1
"three!"	1
and	1
a	1
rapturously	1
breathless	1
cry	1
of	1
children's	1
voices	1
filled	1
the	1
room.	1
"Two,	1
two!"	1
they	1
shouted.	1
	1
This	1
meant	1
two	1
stockings,	1
which	1
by	1
a	1
secret	1
process	1
known	1
only	1
to	1
herself	1
Anna	1
Makarovna	1
used	1
to	1
knit	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
needles,	1
and	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
ready,	1
she	1
always	1
triumphantly	1
drew,	1
one	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
the	1
children's	1
presence.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
children	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
night.	1
They	1
kissed	1
everyone,	1
the	1
tutors	1
and	1
governesses	1
made	1
their	1
bows,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out.	1
Only	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
tutor	1
remained.	1
Dessalles	1
whispered	1
to	1
the	1
boy	1
to	1
come	1
downstairs.	1
	1
"No,	1
Monsieur	1
Dessalles,	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
my	1
aunt	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
stay,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
"Ma	1
tante,	1
please	1
let	1
me	1
stay,"	1
said	1
he,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
aunt.	1
	1
His	1
face	1
expressed	1
entreaty,	1
agitation,	1
and	1
ecstasy.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"When	1
you	1
are	1
here	1
he	1
can't	1
tear	1
himself	1
away,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
you	1
directly,	1
Monsieur	1
Dessalles.	1
Good	1
night!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
giving	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
Swiss	1
tutor,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"You	1
and	1
I	1
haven't	1
seen	1
anything	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
yet...	1
How	1
like	1
he	1
is	1
growing,	1
Mary!"	1
he	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Like	1
my	1
father?"	1
asked	1
the	1
boy,	1
flushing	1
crimson	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
bright,	1
ecstatic	1
eyes.	1
	1
Pierre	1
nodded,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
saying	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
had	1
interrupted.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
sat	1
down	1
doing	1
woolwork;	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
husband.	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Denisov	1
rose,	1
asked	1
for	1
their	1
pipes,	1
smoked,	1
went	1
to	1
fetch	1
more	1
tea	1
from	1
Sonya--who	1
sat	1
weary	1
but	1
resolute	1
at	1
the	1
samovar--and	1
questioned	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
curly-	1
headed,	1
delicate	1
boy	1
sat	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes	1
unnoticed	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
starting	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
and	1
muttering	1
something	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
evidently	1
experiencing	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
powerful	1
emotion	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
curly	1
head,	1
with	1
his	1
thin	1
neck	1
exposed	1
by	1
his	1
turn-down	1
collar,	1
toward	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Pierre	1
sat.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
contemporary	1
gossip	1
about	1
those	1
in	1
power,	1
in	1
which	1
most	1
people	1
see	1
the	1
chief	1
interest	1
of	1
home	1
politics.	1
Denisov,	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
government	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
disappointments	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
heard	1
with	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
done	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
stupid,	1
and	1
made	1
forcible	1
and	1
sharp	1
comments	1
on	1
what	1
Pierre	1
told	1
them.	1
	1
"One	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
German--now	1
one	1
must	1
dance	1
with	1
Tatawinova	1
and	1
Madame	1
Kwudener,	1
and	1
wead	1
Ecka'tshausen	1
and	1
the	1
bwethwen.	1
Oh,	1
they	1
should	1
let	1
that	1
fine	1
fellow	1
Bonaparte	1
loose--he'd	1
knock	1
all	1
this	1
nonsense	1
out	1
of	1
them!	1
Fancy	1
giving	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
Semenov	1
wegiment	1
to	1
a	1
fellow	1
like	1
that	1
Schwa'tz!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
Nicholas,	1
though	1
free	1
from	1
Denisov's	1
readiness	1
to	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
everything,	1
also	1
thought	1
that	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
and	1
weighty	1
matter,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
A	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
Minister	1
of	1
This	1
and	1
B	1
Governor	1
General	1
of	1
That,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
said	1
so-and-so	1
and	1
this	1
minister	1
so-and-so,	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
very	1
important.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
to	1
question	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
questions	1
put	1
by	1
these	1
two	1
kept	1
the	1
conversation	1
from	1
changing	1
its	1
ordinary	1
character	1
of	1
gossip	1
about	1
the	1
higher	1
government	1
circles.	1
	1
But	1
Natasha,	1
knowing	1
all	1
her	1
husband's	1
ways	1
and	1
ideas,	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
wishing	1
but	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
divert	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
another	1
channel	1
and	1
express	1
his	1
own	1
deeply	1
felt	1
idea	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
consult	1
with	1
his	1
new	1
friend	1
Prince	1
Theodore,	1
and	1
she	1
helped	1
him	1
by	1
asking	1
how	1
his	1
affairs	1
with	1
Prince	1
Theodore	1
had	1
gone.	1
	1
"What	1
was	1
it	1
about?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Always	1
the	1
same	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
listeners.	1
"Everybody	1
sees	1
that	1
things	1
are	1
going	1
so	1
badly	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
all	1
decent	1
men	1
to	1
counteract	1
it	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
can."	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
decent	1
men	1
do?"	1
Nicholas	1
inquired,	1
frowning	1
slightly.	1
"What	1
can	1
be	1
done?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
this..."	1
	1
"Come	1
into	1
my	1
study,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
fetched	1
to	1
nurse	1
her	1
baby,	1
now	1
heard	1
the	1
nurse	1
calling	1
her	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
followed	1
her.	1
The	1
men	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
followed	1
them	1
unnoticed	1
by	1
his	1
uncle	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
shady	1
corner	1
by	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
do?"	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Always	1
some	1
fantastic	1
schemes,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Why	1
this,"	1
began	1
Pierre,	1
not	1
sitting	1
down	1
but	1
pacing	1
the	1
room,	1
sometimes	1
stopping	1
short,	1
gesticulating,	1
and	1
lisping:	1
"the	1
position	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
is	1
this:	1
the	1
Emperor	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
into	1
anything.	1
He	1
has	1
abandoned	1
himself	1
altogether	1
to	1
this	1
mysticism"	1
(Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
tolerate	1
mysticism	1
in	1
anyone	1
now).	1
"He	1
seeks	1
only	1
for	1
peace,	1
and	1
only	1
these	1
people	1
sans	1
foi	1
ni	1
loi	1
*	1
can	1
give	1
it	1
him--people	1
who	1
recklessly	1
hack	1
at	1
and	1
strangle	1
everything--Magnitski,	1
Arakcheev,	1
and	1
tutti	1
quanti....	1
You	1
will	1
agree	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
after	1
your	1
estates	1
yourself	1
but	1
only	1
wanted	1
a	1
quiet	1
life,	1
the	1
harsher	1
your	1
steward	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
readily	1
your	1
object	1
might	1
be	1
attained,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Without	1
faith	1
or	1
law.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
does	1
that	1
lead	1
up	1
to?"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Well,	1
everything	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
ruin!	1
Robbery	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
courts,	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
nothing	1
but	1
flogging,	1
drilling,	1
and	1
Military	1
Settlements;	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
tortured,	1
enlightenment	1
is	1
suppressed.	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
young	1
and	1
honest	1
is	1
crushed!	1
Everyone	1
sees	1
that	1
this	1
cannot	1
go	1
on.	1
Everything	1
is	1
strained	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
certainly	1
break,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
(as	1
those	1
who	1
examine	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
any	1
government	1
have	1
always	1
said	1
since	1
governments	1
began).	1
"I	1
told	1
them	1
just	1
one	1
thing	1
in	1
Petersburg."	1
	1
"Told	1
whom?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know	1
whom,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
meaning	1
glance	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows.	1
"Prince	1
Theodore	1
and	1
all	1
those.	1
To	1
encourage	1
culture	1
and	1
philanthropy	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
of	1
course.	1
The	1
aim	1
is	1
excellent	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
circumstances	1
something	1
else	1
is	1
needed."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Nicholas	1
noticed	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
nephew.	1
His	1
face	1
darkened	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
boy.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
here?"	1
	1
"Why?	1
Let	1
him	1
be,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
taking	1
Nicholas	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
continuing.	1
"That	1
is	1
not	1
enough,	1
I	1
told	1
them.	1
Something	1
else	1
is	1
needed.	1
When	1
you	1
stand	1
expecting	1
the	1
overstrained	1
string	1
to	1
snap	1
at	1
any	1
moment,	1
when	1
everyone	1
is	1
expecting	1
the	1
inevitable	1
catastrophe,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
possible	1
must	1
join	1
hands	1
as	1
closely	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
to	1
withstand	1
the	1
general	1
calamity.	1
Everything	1
that	1
is	1
young	1
and	1
strong	1
is	1
being	1
enticed	1
away	1
and	1
depraved.	1
One	1
is	1
lured	1
by	1
women,	1
another	1
by	1
honors,	1
a	1
third	1
by	1
ambition	1
or	1
money,	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
that	1
camp.	1
No	1
independent	1
men,	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
or	1
I,	1
are	1
left.	1
What	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
widen	1
the	1
scope	1
of	1
our	1
society,	1
let	1
the	1
mot	1
d'ordre	1
be	1
not	1
virtue	1
alone	1
but	1
independence	1
and	1
action	1
as	1
well!"	1
	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
nephew,	1
irritably	1
pushed	1
up	1
an	1
armchair,	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
coughing	1
discontentedly	1
and	1
frowning	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
"But	1
action	1
with	1
what	1
aim?"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"And	1
what	1
position	1
will	1
you	1
adopt	1
toward	1
the	1
government?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
assistants.	1
The	1
society	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
secret	1
if	1
the	1
government	1
allows	1
it.	1
Not	1
merely	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
hostile	1
to	1
government,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
society	1
of	1
true	1
conservatives--a	1
society	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
meaning	1
of	1
that	1
word.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
to	1
prevent	1
some	1
Pugachev	1
or	1
other	1
from	1
killing	1
my	1
children	1
and	1
yours,	1
and	1
Arakcheev	1
from	1
sending	1
me	1
off	1
to	1
some	1
Military	1
Settlement.	1
We	1
join	1
hands	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
welfare	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
safety."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
it's	1
a	1
secret	1
society	1
and	1
therefore	1
a	1
hostile	1
and	1
harmful	1
one	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
cause	1
harm."	1
	1
"Why?	1
Did	1
the	1
Tugendbund	1
which	1
saved	1
Europe"	1
(they	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
venture	1
to	1
suggest	1
that	1
Russia	1
had	1
saved	1
Europe)	1
"do	1
any	1
harm?	1
The	1
Tugendbund	1
is	1
an	1
alliance	1
of	1
virtue:	1
it	1
is	1
love,	1
mutual	1
help...	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
Christ	1
preached	1
on	1
the	1
Cross."	1
	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
during	1
the	1
conversation,	1
looked	1
joyfully	1
at	1
her	1
husband.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
that	1
pleased	1
her--that	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
interest	1
her,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
extremely	1
simple	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
it	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
(it	1
seemed	1
so	1
to	1
her	1
because	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
sprang	1
from	1
Pierre's	1
whole	1
soul),	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
animated	1
and	1
enthusiastic	1
appearance	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
glad.	1
	1
The	1
boy	1
with	1
the	1
thin	1
neck	1
stretching	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
turn-down	1
collar--	1
whom	1
everyone	1
had	1
forgotten--gazed	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
even	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
rapturous	1
joy.	1
Every	1
word	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
burned	1
into	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
nervous	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
broke	1
the	1
sealing	1
wax	1
and	1
quill	1
pens	1
his	1
hands	1
came	1
upon	1
on	1
his	1
uncle's	1
table.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
you	1
suppose;	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
German	1
Tugendbund	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
proposing."	1
	1
"No,	1
my	1
fwiend!	1
The	1
Tugendbund	1
is	1
all	1
vewy	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
sausage	1
eaters,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it	1
and	1
can't	1
even	1
pwonounce	1
it,"	1
interposed	1
Denisov	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
resolute	1
voice.	1
"I	1
agwee	1
that	1
evewything	1
here	1
is	1
wotten	1
and	1
howwible,	1
but	1
the	1
Tugendbund	1
I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
If	1
we're	1
not	1
satisfied,	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
a	1
bunt	1
of	1
our	1
own.	1
That's	1
all	1
wight.	1
Je	1
suis	1
vot'e	1
homme!"	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"I'm	1
your	1
man."	1
	1
Pierre	1
smiled,	1
Natasha	1
began	1
to	1
laugh,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
knitted	1
his	1
brows	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
began	1
proving	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
prospect	1
of	1
any	1
great	1
change	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
danger	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
existed	1
only	1
in	1
his	1
imagination.	1
Pierre	1
maintained	1
the	1
contrary,	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
mental	1
faculties	1
were	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
resourceful,	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
himself	1
cornered.	1
This	1
made	1
him	1
still	1
angrier,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
fully	1
convinced,	1
not	1
by	1
reasoning	1
but	1
by	1
something	1
within	1
him	1
stronger	1
than	1
reason,	1
of	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
his	1
opinion.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
this,"	1
he	1
said,	1
rising	1
and	1
trying	1
with	1
nervously	1
twitching	1
fingers	1
to	1
prop	1
up	1
his	1
pipe	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
but	1
finally	1
abandoning	1
the	1
attempt.	1
"I	1
can't	1
prove	1
it	1
to	1
you.	1
You	1
say	1
that	1
everything	1
here	1
is	1
rotten	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
overthrow	1
is	1
coming:	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
it.	1
But	1
you	1
also	1
say	1
that	1
our	1
oath	1
of	1
allegiance	1
is	1
a	1
conditional	1
matter,	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
I	1
reply:	1
'You	1
are	1
my	1
best	1
friend,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
formed	1
a	1
secret	1
society	1
and	1
began	1
working	1
against	1
the	1
government-	1
-be	1
it	1
what	1
it	1
may--I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
government.	1
And	1
if	1
Arakcheev	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
lead	1
a	1
squadron	1
against	1
you	1
and	1
cut	1
you	1
down,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
hesitate	1
an	1
instant,	1
but	1
should	1
do	1
it.'	1
And	1
you	1
may	1
argue	1
about	1
that	1
as	1
you	1
like!"	1
	1
An	1
awkward	1
silence	1
followed	1
these	1
words.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
speak,	1
defending	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
attacking	1
her	1
brother.	1
Her	1
defense	1
was	1
weak	1
and	1
inapt	1
but	1
she	1
attained	1
her	1
object.	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
resumed,	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
unpleasantly	1
hostile	1
tone	1
of	1
Nicholas'	1
last	1
remark.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
all	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
supper,	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
pale	1
and	1
with	1
shining,	1
radiant	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Uncle	1
Pierre,	1
you...	1
no...	1
If	1
Papa	1
were	1
alive...	1
would	1
he	1
agree	1
with	1
you?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
And	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
realized	1
what	1
a	1
special,	1
independent,	1
complex,	1
and	1
powerful	1
process	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
feeling	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
boy	1
during	1
that	1
conversation,	1
and	1
remembering	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
regretted	1
that	1
the	1
lad	1
should	1
have	1
heard	1
him.	1
He	1
had,	1
however,	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
answer.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
think	1
so,"	1
he	1
said	1
reluctantly,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
study.	1
	1
The	1
lad	1
looked	1
down	1
and	1
seemed	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
to	1
notice	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
He	1
flushed	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Uncle,	1
forgive	1
me,	1
I	1
did	1
that...	1
unintentionally,"	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
broken	1
sealing	1
wax	1
and	1
pens.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
started	1
angrily.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,"	1
he	1
said,	1
throwing	1
the	1
bits	1
under	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
And	1
evidently	1
suppressing	1
his	1
vexation	1
with	1
difficulty,	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
boy.	1
	1
"You	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
at	1
all,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
at	1
supper	1
was	1
not	1
about	1
politics	1
or	1
societies,	1
but	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
Nicholas	1
liked	1
best--recollections	1
of	1
1812.	1
Denisov	1
started	1
these	1
and	1
Pierre	1
was	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1
and	1
amusing	1
about	1
them.	1
The	1
family	1
separated	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
friendly	1
terms.	1
	1
After	1
supper	1
Nicholas,	1
having	1
undressed	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
given	1
instructions	1
to	1
the	1
steward	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
him,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
in	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
wife	1
still	1
at	1
her	1
table,	1
writing.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
writing,	1
Mary?"	1
Nicholas	1
asked.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
blushed.	1
She	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
writing	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
understood	1
or	1
approved	1
by	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
She	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
conceal	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
writing	1
from	1
him,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
had	1
surprised	1
her	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
	1
"A	1
diary,	1
Nicholas,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
handing	1
him	1
a	1
blue	1
exercise	1
book	1
filled	1
with	1
her	1
firm,	1
bold	1
writing.	1
	1
"A	1
diary?"	1
Nicholas	1
repeated	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
irony,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
book.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
December	1
4.	1
Today	1
when	1
Andrusha	1
(her	1
eldest	1
boy)	1
woke	1
up	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Louise	1
sent	1
for	1
me.	1
He	1
was	1
naughty	1
and	1
obstinate.	1
I	1
tried	1
threats,	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
grew	1
angrier.	1
Then	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
hand:	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
alone	1
and	1
began	1
with	1
nurse's	1
help	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
other	1
children	1
up,	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
him.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
silent,	1
as	1
if	1
astonished,	1
then	1
he	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
bed,	1
ran	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
shirt,	1
and	1
sobbed	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
calm	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
what	1
troubled	1
him	1
most	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
grieved	1
me.	1
Afterwards	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
ticket,	1
he	1
again	1
began	1
crying	1
piteously	1
and	1
kissing	1
me.	1
One	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
tenderness.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
a	1
'ticket'?"	1
Nicholas	1
inquired.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
begun	1
giving	1
the	1
elder	1
ones	1
marks	1
every	1
evening,	1
showing	1
how	1
they	1
have	1
behaved."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
that	1
were	1
gazing	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
turn	1
over	1
the	1
pages	1
and	1
read.	1
In	1
the	1
diary	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
children's	1
lives	1
that	1
seemed	1
noteworthy	1
to	1
their	1
mother	1
as	1
showing	1
their	1
characters	1
or	1
suggesting	1
general	1
reflections	1
on	1
educational	1
methods.	1
They	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
quite	1
insignificant	1
trifles,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
mother	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
father	1
either,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
read	1
this	1
diary	1
about	1
his	1
children	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
	1
Under	1
the	1
date	1
"5"	1
was	1
entered:	1
	1
Mitya	1
was	1
naughty	1
at	1
table.	1
Papa	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
pudding.	1
He	1
had	1
none,	1
but	1
looked	1
so	1
unhappily	1
and	1
greedily	1
at	1
the	1
others	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
eating!	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
punishment	1
by	1
depriving	1
children	1
of	1
sweets	1
only	1
develops	1
their	1
greediness.	1
Must	1
tell	1
Nicholas	1
this.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
wife.	1
The	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
questioningly:	1
would	1
he	1
approve	1
or	1
disapprove	1
of	1
her	1
diary?	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
approval	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
his	1
admiration	1
for	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
so	1
pedantically,	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
or	1
even	1
done	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
this	1
untiring,	1
continual	1
spiritual	1
effort	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
sole	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
children's	1
moral	1
welfare	1
delighted	1
him.	1
Had	1
Nicholas	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
analyze	1
his	1
feelings	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
steady,	1
tender,	1
and	1
proud	1
love	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
rested	1
on	1
his	1
feeling	1
of	1
wonder	1
at	1
her	1
spirituality	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
lofty	1
moral	1
world,	1
almost	1
beyond	1
his	1
reach,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
her	1
being.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
intelligence	1
and	1
goodness,	1
recognized	1
his	1
own	1
insignificance	1
beside	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
spiritual	1
world,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
that	1
she	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
soul	1
not	1
only	1
belonged	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
was	1
part	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
"I	1
quite,	1
quite	1
approve,	1
my	1
dearest!"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
look,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
he	1
added:	1
"And	1
I	1
behaved	1
badly	1
today.	1
You	1
weren't	1
in	1
the	1
study.	1
We	1
began	1
disputing--Pierre	1
and	1
I--and	1
I	1
lost	1
my	1
temper.	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
impossible:	1
such	1
a	1
child!	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
him	1
if	1
Natasha	1
didn't	1
keep	1
him	1
in	1
hand....	1
Have	1
you	1
any	1
idea	1
why	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Petersburg?	1
They	1
have	1
formed..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
know,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"Natasha	1
told	1
me."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
know,"	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
on,	1
growing	1
hot	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
recollection	1
of	1
their	1
discussion,	1
"he	1
wanted	1
to	1
convince	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
every	1
honest	1
man's	1
duty	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
oath	1
of	1
allegiance	1
and	1
duty...	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
you	1
weren't	1
there.	1
They	1
all	1
fell	1
on	1
me--Denisov	1
and	1
Natasha...	1
Natasha	1
is	1
absurd.	1
How	1
she	1
rules	1
over	1
him!	1
And	1
yet	1
there	1
need	1
only	1
be	1
a	1
discussion	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
words	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
but	1
only	1
repeats	1
his	1
sayings..."	1
added	1
Nicholas,	1
yielding	1
to	1
that	1
irresistible	1
inclination	1
which	1
tempts	1
us	1
to	1
judge	1
those	1
nearest	1
and	1
dearest	1
to	1
us.	1
He	1
forgot	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
about	1
Natasha	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
applied	1
word	1
for	1
word	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
noticed	1
that,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
duty	1
and	1
the	1
oath	1
were	1
above	1
everything,	1
he	1
started	1
proving	1
goodness	1
knows	1
what!	1
A	1
pity	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
there--what	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
said?"	1
	1
"As	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
you	1
were	1
quite	1
right,	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
Natasha	1
so.	1
Pierre	1
says	1
everybody	1
is	1
suffering,	1
tortured,	1
and	1
being	1
corrupted,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
our	1
duty	1
to	1
help	1
our	1
neighbor.	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
is	1
right	1
there,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
"but	1
he	1
forgets	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
other	1
duties	1
nearer	1
to	1
us,	1
duties	1
indicated	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
God	1
Himself,	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
we	1
might	1
expose	1
ourselves	1
to	1
risks	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
risk	1
our	1
children."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
it!	1
That's	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
him,"	1
put	1
in	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
fancied	1
he	1
really	1
had	1
said	1
it.	1
"But	1
they	1
insisted	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
view:	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
neighbor	1
and	1
Christianity--and	1
all	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
young	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
my	1
study	1
and	1
broke	1
all	1
my	1
things."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Nicholas,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
often	1
troubled	1
about	1
little	1
Nicholas,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"He	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
exceptional	1
boy.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
I	1
neglect	1
him	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
my	1
own:	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
children	1
and	1
relations	1
while	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
one.	1
He	1
is	1
constantly	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
thoughts."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
need	1
reproach	1
yourself	1
on	1
his	1
account.	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
fondest	1
mother	1
could	1
do	1
for	1
her	1
son	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
and	1
are	1
doing	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
lad,	1
a	1
fine	1
lad!	1
This	1
evening	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
Pierre	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
trance,	1
and	1
fancy--as	1
we	1
were	1
going	1
in	1
to	1
supper	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
everything	1
on	1
my	1
table	1
to	1
bits,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
himself	1
at	1
once!	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
an	1
untruth.	1
A	1
fine	1
lad,	1
a	1
fine	1
lad!"	1
repeated	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
at	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
fond	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
but	1
was	1
always	1
anxious	1
to	1
recognize	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
lad.	1
	1
"Still,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
mother,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"I	1
feel	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
it	1
troubles	1
me.	1
A	1
wonderful	1
boy,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
dreadfully	1
afraid	1
for	1
him.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
companions."	1
	1
"Well	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
for	1
long.	1
Next	1
summer	1
I'll	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
Petersburg,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"Yes,	1
Pierre	1
always	1
was	1
a	1
dreamer	1
and	1
always	1
will	1
be,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
talk	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
which	1
had	1
evidently	1
disturbed	1
him.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
mine	1
what	1
goes	1
on	1
there--	1
whether	1
Arakcheev	1
is	1
bad,	1
and	1
all	1
that?	1
What	1
business	1
was	1
it	1
of	1
mine	1
when	1
I	1
married	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
deep	1
in	1
debt	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
threatened	1
with	1
prison,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
mother	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
or	1
understand	1
it?	1
And	1
then	1
there	1
are	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
our	1
affairs.	1
Is	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
pleasure	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
the	1
farm	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
office	1
from	1
morning	1
to	1
night?	1
No,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
must	1
work	1
to	1
comfort	1
my	1
mother,	1
to	1
repay	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
children	1
such	1
beggars	1
as	1
I	1
was."	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
live	1
by	1
bread	1
alone	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
attached	1
too	1
much	1
importance	1
to	1
these	1
matters.	1
But	1
she	1
knew	1
she	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
useless	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
She	1
only	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it.	1
He	1
took	1
this	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
approval	1
and	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
reflection	1
continued	1
to	1
think	1
aloud.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Mary,	1
today	1
Elias	1
Mitrofanych"	1
(this	1
was	1
his	1
overseer)	1
"came	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
Tambov	1
estate	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
they	1
are	1
already	1
offering	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
for	1
the	1
forest."	1
	1
And	1
with	1
an	1
eager	1
face	1
Nicholas	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
repurchasing	1
Otradnoe	1
before	1
long,	1
and	1
added:	1
"Another	1
ten	1
years	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
leave	1
the	1
children...	1
in	1
an	1
excellent	1
position."	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
her.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
aloud	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
he	1
would	1
sometimes	1
ask	1
her	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
saying,	1
and	1
be	1
vexed	1
if	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
something	1
else.	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
force	1
herself	1
to	1
attend,	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
her	1
at	1
all.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
think,	1
but	1
felt,	1
about	1
something	1
different.	1
She	1
felt	1
a	1
submissive	1
tender	1
love	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
would	1
never	1
understand	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
understood,	1
and	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
still	1
stronger	1
and	1
added	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
passionate	1
tenderness.	1
Besides	1
this	1
feeling	1
which	1
absorbed	1
her	1
altogether	1
and	1
hindered	1
her	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
plans,	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
connection	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
flitted	1
through	1
her	1
mind.	1
She	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
nephew.	1
Her	1
husband's	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
boy's	1
agitation	1
while	1
Pierre	1
was	1
speaking	1
struck	1
her	1
forcibly,	1
and	1
various	1
traits	1
of	1
his	1
gentle,	1
sensitive	1
character	1
recurred	1
to	1
her	1
mind;	1
and	1
while	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
nephew	1
she	1
thought	1
also	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
children.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
compare	1
them	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
compared	1
her	1
feeling	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
feeling	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
felt	1
with	1
regret	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
lacking	1
in	1
her	1
feeling	1
for	1
young	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
this	1
difference	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
their	1
ages,	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
to	1
blame	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
promised	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
to	1
do	1
better	1
and	1
to	1
accomplish	1
the	1
impossible--in	1
this	1
life	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
husband,	1
her	1
children,	1
little	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
neighbors,	1
as	1
Christ	1
loved	1
mankind.	1
Countess	1
Mary's	1
soul	1
always	1
strove	1
toward	1
the	1
infinite,	1
the	1
eternal,	1
and	1
the	1
absolute,	1
and	1
could	1
therefore	1
never	1
be	1
at	1
peace.	1
A	1
stern	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
lofty,	1
secret	1
suffering	1
of	1
a	1
soul	1
burdened	1
by	1
the	1
body	1
appeared	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
Nicholas	1
gazed	1
at	1
her.	1
"O	1
God!	1
What	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
us	1
if	1
she	1
dies,	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
fear	1
when	1
her	1
face	1
is	1
like	1
that?"	1
thought	1
he,	1
and	1
placing	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
icon	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
his	1
evening	1
prayers.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
left	1
alone,	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
as	1
only	1
a	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
can	1
talk,	1
that	1
is,	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
clearness	1
and	1
rapidity,	1
understanding	1
and	1
expressing	1
each	1
other's	1
thoughts	1
in	1
ways	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
rules	1
of	1
logic,	1
without	1
premises,	1
deductions,	1
or	1
conclusions,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
quite	1
peculiar	1
way.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
talk	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
for	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
surest	1
sign	1
of	1
something	1
being	1
wrong	1
between	1
them	1
if	1
Pierre	1
followed	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
logical	1
reasoning.	1
When	1
he	1
began	1
proving	1
anything,	1
or	1
talking	1
argumentatively	1
and	1
calmly	1
and	1
she,	1
led	1
on	1
by	1
his	1
example,	1
began	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
a	1
quarrel.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
and	1
Natasha	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
wide-	1
open	1
happy	1
eyes,	1
and	1
quickly	1
seizing	1
his	1
head	1
pressed	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
bosom,	1
saying:	1
"Now	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
mine,	1
mine!	1
You	1
won't	1
escape!"--from	1
that	1
moment	1
this	1
conversation	1
began,	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
logic	1
and	1
contrary	1
to	1
them	1
because	1
quite	1
different	1
subjects	1
were	1
talked	1
about	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
This	1
simultaneous	1
discussion	1
of	1
many	1
topics	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
a	1
clear	1
understanding	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
the	1
surest	1
sign	1
that	1
they	1
fully	1
understood	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
when	1
all	1
is	1
uncertain,	1
unreasoning,	1
and	1
contradictory,	1
except	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
guides	1
the	1
dream,	1
so	1
in	1
this	1
intercourse	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
laws	1
of	1
reason,	1
the	1
words	1
themselves	1
were	1
not	1
consecutive	1
and	1
clear	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
prompted	1
them.	1
	1
Natasha	1
spoke	1
to	1
Pierre	1
about	1
her	1
brother's	1
life	1
and	1
doings,	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
and	1
lacked	1
life	1
during	1
his	1
own	1
absence,	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
fonder	1
than	1
ever	1
of	1
Mary,	1
and	1
how	1
Mary	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
better	1
than	1
herself.	1
In	1
saying	1
this	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sincere	1
in	1
acknowledging	1
Mary's	1
superiority,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
by	1
saying	1
it	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
demand	1
on	1
Pierre	1
that	1
he	1
should,	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
prefer	1
her	1
to	1
Mary	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
other	1
women,	1
and	1
that	1
now,	1
especially	1
after	1
having	1
seen	1
many	1
women	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
he	1
should	1
tell	1
her	1
so	1
afresh.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
answering	1
Natasha's	1
words,	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
intolerable	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
meet	1
ladies	1
at	1
dinners	1
and	1
balls	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
quite	1
lost	1
the	1
knack	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
ladies,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"It	1
was	1
simply	1
dull.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
busy."	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
on:	1
	1
"Mary	1
is	1
so	1
splendid,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"How	1
she	1
understands	1
children!	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
saw	1
straight	1
into	1
their	1
souls.	1
Yesterday,	1
for	1
instance,	1
Mitya	1
was	1
naughty..."	1
	1
"How	1
like	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
is,"	1
Pierre	1
interjected.	1
	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
why	1
he	1
mentioned	1
Mitya's	1
likeness	1
to	1
Nicholas:	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
his	1
dispute	1
with	1
his	1
brother-in-law	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
Natasha	1
thought	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"Nicholas	1
has	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
never	1
agreeing	1
with	1
anything	1
not	1
generally	1
accepted.	1
But	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
value	1
what	1
opens	1
up	1
a	1
fresh	1
line,"	1
said	1
she,	1
repeating	1
words	1
Pierre	1
had	1
once	1
uttered.	1
	1
"No,	1
the	1
chief	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
ideas	1
and	1
discussions	1
are	1
an	1
amusement--almost	1
a	1
pastime,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"For	1
instance,	1
he	1
is	1
collecting	1
a	1
library	1
and	1
has	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
not	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
new	1
book	1
till	1
he	1
has	1
read	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
bought--Sismondi	1
and	1
Rousseau	1
and	1
Montesquieu,"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"You	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
I..."	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
soften	1
down	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said;	1
but	1
Natasha	1
interrupted	1
him	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
unnecessary.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
say	1
ideas	1
are	1
an	1
amusement	1
to	1
him...."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
nothing	1
else	1
is	1
serious.	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
saw	1
everyone	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
When	1
I	1
am	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
thought,	1
all	1
else	1
is	1
mere	1
amusement."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
I'm	1
so	1
sorry	1
I	1
wasn't	1
there	1
when	1
you	1
met	1
the	1
children,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Which	1
was	1
most	1
delighted?	1
Lisa,	1
I'm	1
sure."	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
Pierre	1
replied,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
"Nicholas	1
says	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
think.	1
But	1
I	1
can't	1
help	1
it.	1
Besides,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
felt	1
(I	1
can	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
you)	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
pieces	1
without	1
me--everyone	1
was	1
pulling	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
But	1
I	1
succeeded	1
in	1
uniting	1
them	1
all;	1
and	1
then	1
my	1
idea	1
is	1
so	1
clear	1
and	1
simple.	1
You	1
see,	1
I	1
don't	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
oppose	1
this	1
and	1
that.	1
We	1
may	1
be	1
mistaken.	1
What	1
I	1
say	1
is:	1
'Join	1
hands,	1
you	1
who	1
love	1
the	1
right,	1
and	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
but	1
one	1
banner--that	1
of	1
active	1
virtue.'	1
Prince	1
Sergey	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
and	1
clever."	1
	1
Natasha	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
idea,	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
disconcerted	1
her.	1
"Can	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
important	1
and	1
necessary	1
to	1
society	1
be	1
also	1
my	1
husband?	1
How	1
did	1
this	1
happen?"	1
She	1
wished	1
to	1
express	1
this	1
doubt	1
to	1
him.	1
"Now	1
who	1
could	1
decide	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
cleverer	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
others?"	1
she	1
asked	1
herself,	1
and	1
passed	1
in	1
review	1
all	1
those	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
most	1
respected.	1
Judging	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
respected	1
so	1
highly	1
as	1
Platon	1
Karataev.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
thinking	1
about?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"About	1
Platon	1
Karataev.	1
Would	1
he	1
have	1
approved	1
of	1
you	1
now,	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
surprised	1
at	1
this	1
question.	1
He	1
understood	1
his	1
wife's	1
line	1
of	1
thought.	1
	1
"Platon	1
Karataev?"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
and	1
pondered,	1
evidently	1
sincerely	1
trying	1
to	1
imagine	1
Karataev's	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
"He	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
understood...	1
yet	1
perhaps	1
he	1
would."	1
	1
"I	1
love	1
you	1
awfully!"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
said.	1
"Awfully,	1
awfully!"	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
approved,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
after	1
reflection.	1
"What	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
approved	1
of	1
is	1
our	1
family	1
life.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
find	1
seemliness,	1
happiness,	1
and	1
peace	1
in	1
everything,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
proud	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
us.	1
There	1
now--you	1
talk	1
of	1
my	1
absence,	1
but	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
believe	1
what	1
a	1
special	1
feeling	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
you	1
after	1
a	1
separation...."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
should	1
think..."	1
Natasha	1
began.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
not	1
that.	1
I	1
never	1
leave	1
off	1
loving	1
you.	1
And	1
one	1
couldn't	1
love	1
more,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
something	1
special....	1
Yes,	1
of	1
course-"	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
because	1
their	1
eyes	1
meeting	1
said	1
the	1
rest.	1
	1
"What	1
nonsense	1
it	1
is,"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
"about	1
honeymoons,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
is	1
at	1
first!	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all.	1
If	1
only	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
away!	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
quarreled?	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
my	1
fault.	1
Always	1
mine.	1
And	1
what	1
we	1
quarreled	1
about--I	1
don't	1
even	1
remember!"	1
	1
"Always	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Jealo..."	1
	1
"Don't	1
say	1
it!	1
I	1
can't	1
bear	1
it!"	1
Natasha	1
cried,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
glittered	1
coldly	1
and	1
vindictively.	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
her?"	1
she	1
added,	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
	1
"No,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
have	1
recognized	1
her."	1
	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
do	1
you	1
know?	1
While	1
you	1
were	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
you,"	1
Natasha	1
began,	1
evidently	1
anxious	1
to	1
disperse	1
the	1
cloud	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
them.	1
"You	1
are	1
as	1
like	1
him	1
as	1
two	1
peas--like	1
the	1
boy."	1
(She	1
meant	1
her	1
little	1
son.)	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him....	1
The	1
milk's	1
come....	1
But	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
you."	1
	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
they	1
both	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
Pierre	1
began	1
with	1
self-	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
enthusiasm,	1
Natasha	1
with	1
a	1
quiet,	1
happy	1
smile.	1
Having	1
interrupted	1
one	1
another	1
they	1
both	1
stopped	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
other	1
continue.	1
	1
"No.	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
say?	1
Go	1
on,	1
go	1
on."	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
go	1
on,	1
I	1
was	1
talking	1
nonsense,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Pierre	1
finished	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
begun.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
sequel	1
to	1
his	1
complacent	1
reflections	1
on	1
his	1
success	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
chosen	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
new	1
direction	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
Russian	1
society	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
ideas	1
that	1
have	1
great	1
results	1
are	1
always	1
simple	1
ones.	1
My	1
whole	1
idea	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
vicious	1
people	1
are	1
united	1
and	1
constitute	1
a	1
power,	1
then	1
honest	1
folk	1
must	1
do	1
the	1
same.	1
Now	1
that's	1
simple	1
enough."	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
were	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
say?"	1
	1
"I?	1
Only	1
nonsense."	1
	1
"But	1
all	1
the	1
same?"	1
	1
"Oh	1
nothing,	1
only	1
a	1
trifle,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
smilingly	1
still	1
more	1
brightly.	1
"I	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
Petya:	1
today	1
nurse	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
laughed,	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
me.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
hiding.	1
Awfully	1
sweet!	1
There,	1
now	1
he's	1
crying.	1
Well,	1
good-by!"	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
downstairs	1
in	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski's	1
bedroom	1
a	1
little	1
lamp	1
was	1
burning	1
as	1
usual.	1
(The	1
boy	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
cure	1
him	1
of	1
it.)	1
Dessalles	1
slept	1
propped	1
up	1
on	1
four	1
pillows	1
and	1
his	1
Roman	1
nose	1
emitted	1
sounds	1
of	1
rhythmic	1
snoring.	1
Little	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
waked	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
perspiration,	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
and	1
gazed	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes.	1
He	1
had	1
awaked	1
from	1
a	1
terrible	1
dream.	1
He	1
had	1
dreamed	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Uncle	1
Pierre,	1
wearing	1
helmets	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
depicted	1
in	1
his	1
Plutarch,	1
were	1
leading	1
a	1
huge	1
army.	1
The	1
army	1
was	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
white	1
slanting	1
lines	1
that	1
filled	1
the	1
air	1
like	1
the	1
cobwebs	1
that	1
float	1
about	1
in	1
autumn	1
and	1
which	1
Dessalles	1
called	1
les	1
fils	1
de	1
la	1
Vierge.	1
In	1
front	1
was	1
Glory,	1
which	1
was	1
similar	1
to	1
those	1
threads	1
but	1
rather	1
thicker.	1
He	1
and	1
Pierre	1
were	1
borne	1
along	1
lightly	1
and	1
joyously,	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
their	1
goal.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
threads	1
that	1
moved	1
them	1
began	1
to	1
slacken	1
and	1
become	1
entangled	1
and	1
it	1
grew	1
difficult	1
to	1
move.	1
And	1
Uncle	1
Nicholas	1
stood	1
before	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
stern	1
and	1
threatening	1
attitude.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
done	1
this?"	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
some	1
broken	1
sealing	1
wax	1
and	1
pens.	1
"I	1
loved	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
orders	1
from	1
Arakcheev	1
and	1
will	1
kill	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
you	1
who	1
moves	1
forward."	1
Little	1
Nicholas	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Pierre	1
but	1
Pierre	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there.	1
In	1
his	1
place	1
was	1
his	1
father--	1
Prince	1
Andrew--and	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
neither	1
shape	1
nor	1
form,	1
but	1
he	1
existed,	1
and	1
when	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
perceived	1
him	1
he	1
grew	1
faint	1
with	1
love:	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
powerless,	1
limp,	1
and	1
formless.	1
His	1
father	1
caressed	1
and	1
pitied	1
him.	1
But	1
Uncle	1
Nicholas	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
them.	1
Terror	1
seized	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
he	1
awoke.	1
	1
"My	1
father!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
(Though	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
good	1
portraits	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
Nicholas	1
never	1
imagined	1
him	1
in	1
human	1
form.)	1
"My	1
father	1
has	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
caressed	1
me.	1
He	1
approved	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
Uncle	1
Pierre.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
may	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
Mucius	1
Scaevola	1
burned	1
his	1
hand.	1
Why	1
should	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
happen	1
to	1
me?	1
I	1
know	1
they	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
learn.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
learn.	1
But	1
someday	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
finished	1
learning,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
something.	1
I	1
only	1
pray	1
God	1
that	1
something	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
me	1
such	1
as	1
happened	1
to	1
Plutarch's	1
men,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
act	1
as	1
they	1
did.	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
better.	1
Everyone	1
shall	1
know	1
me,	1
love	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
delighted	1
with	1
me!"	1
And	1
suddenly	1
his	1
bosom	1
heaved	1
with	1
sobs	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
ill?"	1
he	1
heard	1
Dessalles'	1
voice	1
asking.	1
	1
"No,"	1
answered	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
lay	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
pillow.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
kind	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
him!"	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
Dessalles.	1
"But	1
Uncle	1
Pierre!	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
wonderful	1
man	1
he	1
is!	1
And	1
my	1
father?	1
Oh,	1
Father,	1
Father!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
something	1
with	1
which	1
even	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
satisfied...."	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
History	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
nations	1
and	1
of	1
humanity.	1
To	1
seize	1
and	1
put	1
into	1
words,	1
to	1
describe	1
directly	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
humanity	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
nation,	1
appears	1
impossible.	1
	1
The	1
ancient	1
historians	1
all	1
employed	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
method	1
to	1
describe	1
and	1
seize	1
the	1
apparently	1
elusive--the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
people.	1
They	1
described	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
individuals	1
who	1
ruled	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
regarded	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
as	1
representing	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
nation.	1
	1
The	1
question:	1
how	1
did	1
individuals	1
make	1
nations	1
act	1
as	1
they	1
wished	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
these	1
individuals	1
themselves	1
guided?	1
the	1
ancients	1
met	1
by	1
recognizing	1
a	1
divinity	1
which	1
subjected	1
the	1
nations	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
chosen	1
man,	1
and	1
guided	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
that	1
chosen	1
man	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
accomplish	1
ends	1
that	1
were	1
predestined.	1
	1
For	1
the	1
ancients	1
these	1
questions	1
were	1
solved	1
by	1
a	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
direct	1
participation	1
of	1
the	1
Deity	1
in	1
human	1
affairs.	1
	1
Modern	1
history,	1
in	1
theory,	1
rejects	1
both	1
these	1
principles.	1
	1
It	1
would	1
seem	1
that	1
having	1
rejected	1
the	1
belief	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
in	1
man's	1
subjection	1
to	1
the	1
Deity	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
predetermined	1
aim	1
toward	1
which	1
nations	1
are	1
led,	1
modern	1
history	1
should	1
study	1
not	1
the	1
manifestations	1
of	1
power	1
but	1
the	1
causes	1
that	1
produce	1
it.	1
But	1
modern	1
history	1
has	1
not	1
done	1
this.	1
Having	1
in	1
theory	1
rejected	1
the	1
view	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
ancients,	1
it	1
still	1
follows	1
them	1
in	1
practice.	1
	1
Instead	1
of	1
men	1
endowed	1
with	1
divine	1
authority	1
and	1
directly	1
guided	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
modern	1
history	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
either	1
heroes	1
endowed	1
with	1
extraordinary,	1
superhuman	1
capacities,	1
or	1
simply	1
men	1
of	1
very	1
various	1
kinds,	1
from	1
monarchs	1
to	1
journalists,	1
who	1
lead	1
the	1
masses.	1
Instead	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
divinely	1
appointed	1
aims	1
of	1
the	1
Jewish,	1
Greek,	1
or	1
Roman	1
nations,	1
which	1
ancient	1
historians	1
regarded	1
as	1
representing	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
humanity,	1
modern	1
history	1
has	1
postulated	1
its	1
own	1
aims--the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
German,	1
or	1
English	1
people,	1
or,	1
in	1
its	1
highest	1
abstraction,	1
the	1
welfare	1
and	1
civilization	1
of	1
humanity	1
in	1
general,	1
by	1
which	1
is	1
usually	1
meant	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
occupying	1
a	1
small	1
northwesterly	1
portion	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
continent.	1
	1
Modern	1
history	1
has	1
rejected	1
the	1
beliefs	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
without	1
replacing	1
them	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
conception,	1
and	1
the	1
logic	1
of	1
the	1
situation	1
has	1
obliged	1
the	1
historians,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
apparently	1
rejected	1
the	1
divine	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
and	1
the	1
"fate"	1
of	1
the	1
ancients,	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
same	1
conclusion	1
by	1
another	1
road,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
recognize	1
(1)	1
nations	1
guided	1
by	1
individual	1
men,	1
and	1
(2)	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
a	1
known	1
aim	1
to	1
which	1
these	1
nations	1
and	1
humanity	1
at	1
large	1
are	1
tending.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
modern	1
historians	1
from	1
Gibbon	1
to	1
Buckle,	1
despite	1
their	1
seeming	1
disagreements	1
and	1
the	1
apparent	1
novelty	1
of	1
their	1
outlooks,	1
lie	1
those	1
two	1
old,	1
unavoidable	1
assumptions.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
the	1
historian	1
describes	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
individuals	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
have	1
directed	1
humanity	1
(one	1
historian	1
considers	1
only	1
monarchs,	1
generals,	1
and	1
ministers	1
as	1
being	1
such	1
men,	1
while	1
another	1
includes	1
also	1
orators,	1
learned	1
men,	1
reformers,	1
philosophers,	1
and	1
poets).	1
Secondly,	1
it	1
is	1
assumed	1
that	1
the	1
goal	1
toward	1
which	1
humanity	1
is	1
being	1
led	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
historians:	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
this	1
goal	1
is	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
Roman,	1
Spanish,	1
or	1
French	1
realm;	1
to	1
another	1
it	1
is	1
liberty,	1
equality,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
kind	1
of	1
civilization	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
called	1
Europe.	1
	1
In	1
1789	1
a	1
ferment	1
arises	1
in	1
Paris;	1
it	1
grows,	1
spreads,	1
and	1
is	1
expressed	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
peoples	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east.	1
Several	1
times	1
it	1
moves	1
eastward	1
and	1
collides	1
with	1
a	1
countermovement	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
westward.	1
In	1
1812	1
it	1
reaches	1
its	1
extreme	1
limit,	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
remarkable	1
symmetry,	1
a	1
countermovement	1
occurs	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west,	1
attracting	1
to	1
it,	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
movement	1
had	1
done,	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
middle	1
Europe.	1
The	1
counter	1
movement	1
reaches	1
the	1
starting	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
movement	1
in	1
the	1
west--Paris--and	1
subsides.	1
	1
During	1
that	1
twenty-year	1
period	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
fields	1
were	1
left	1
untilled,	1
houses	1
were	1
burned,	1
trade	1
changed	1
its	1
direction,	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
migrated,	1
were	1
impoverished,	1
or	1
were	1
enriched,	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
Christian	1
men	1
professing	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
love	1
of	1
their	1
fellows	1
slew	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
What	1
does	1
all	1
this	1
mean?	1
Why	1
did	1
it	1
happen?	1
What	1
made	1
those	1
people	1
burn	1
houses	1
and	1
slay	1
their	1
fellow	1
men?	1
What	1
were	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
these	1
events?	1
What	1
force	1
made	1
men	1
act	1
so?	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
instinctive,	1
plain,	1
and	1
most	1
legitimate	1
questions	1
humanity	1
asks	1
itself	1
when	1
it	1
encounters	1
the	1
monuments	1
and	1
tradition	1
of	1
that	1
period.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
the	1
common	1
sense	1
of	1
mankind	1
turns	1
to	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
history,	1
whose	1
aim	1
is	1
to	1
enable	1
nations	1
and	1
humanity	1
to	1
know	1
themselves.	1
	1
If	1
history	1
had	1
retained	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
God,	1
to	1
reward	1
or	1
punish	1
his	1
people,	1
gave	1
Napoleon	1
power	1
and	1
directed	1
his	1
will	1
to	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
the	1
divine	1
ends,	1
and	1
that	1
reply	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
clear	1
and	1
complete.	1
One	1
might	1
believe	1
or	1
disbelieve	1
in	1
the	1
divine	1
significance	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
but	1
for	1
anyone	1
believing	1
in	1
it	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
nothing	1
unintelligible	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
that	1
period,	1
nor	1
would	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
any	1
contradictions.	1
	1
But	1
modern	1
history	1
cannot	1
give	1
that	1
reply.	1
Science	1
does	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
direct	1
participation	1
of	1
the	1
Deity	1
in	1
human	1
affairs,	1
and	1
therefore	1
history	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
other	1
answers.	1
	1
Modern	1
history	1
replying	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
says:	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
this	1
movement	1
means,	1
what	1
caused	1
it,	1
and	1
what	1
force	1
produced	1
these	1
events?	1
Then	1
listen:	1
	1
"Louis	1
XIV	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
proud	1
and	1
self-confident	1
man;	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
mistresses	1
and	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
ministers	1
and	1
he	1
ruled	1
France	1
badly.	1
His	1
descendants	1
were	1
weak	1
men	1
and	1
they	1
too	1
ruled	1
France	1
badly.	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
favorites	1
and	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
mistresses.	1
Moreover,	1
certain	1
men	1
wrote	1
some	1
books	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dozen	1
men	1
in	1
Paris	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
all	1
men	1
being	1
free	1
and	1
equal.	1
This	1
caused	1
people	1
all	1
over	1
France	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
slash	1
at	1
and	1
drown	1
one	1
another.	1
They	1
killed	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
people.	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
France	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
genius--Napoleon.	1
He	1
conquered	1
everybody	1
everywhere--that	1
is,	1
he	1
killed	1
many	1
people	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
genius.	1
And	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
kill	1
Africans,	1
and	1
killed	1
them	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
cunning	1
and	1
wise	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
France	1
he	1
ordered	1
everybody	1
to	1
obey	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
obeyed	1
him.	1
Having	1
become	1
an	1
Emperor	1
he	1
again	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
kill	1
people	1
in	1
Italy,	1
Austria,	1
and	1
Prussia.	1
And	1
there	1
too	1
he	1
killed	1
a	1
great	1
many.	1
In	1
Russia	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
Emperor,	1
Alexander,	1
who	1
decided	1
to	1
restore	1
order	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
therefore	1
fought	1
against	1
Napoleon.	1
In	1
1807	1
he	1
suddenly	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
in	1
1811	1
they	1
again	1
quarreled	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
killing	1
many	1
people.	1
Napoleon	1
led	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
into	1
Russia	1
and	1
captured	1
Moscow;	1
then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
ran	1
away	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,	1
helped	1
by	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
Stein	1
and	1
others,	1
united	1
Europe	1
to	1
arm	1
against	1
the	1
disturber	1
of	1
its	1
peace.	1
All	1
Napoleon's	1
allies	1
suddenly	1
became	1
his	1
enemies	1
and	1
their	1
forces	1
advanced	1
against	1
the	1
fresh	1
forces	1
he	1
raised.	1
The	1
Allies	1
defeated	1
Napoleon,	1
entered	1
Paris,	1
forced	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
abdicate,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Elba,	1
not	1
depriving	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
Emperor	1
and	1
showing	1
him	1
every	1
respect,	1
though	1
five	1
years	1
before	1
and	1
one	1
year	1
later	1
they	1
all	1
regarded	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
outlaw	1
and	1
a	1
brigand.	1
Then	1
Louis	1
XVIII,	1
who	1
till	1
then	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
laughingstock	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
the	1
Allies,	1
began	1
to	1
reign.	1
And	1
Napoleon,	1
shedding	1
tears	1
before	1
his	1
Old	1
Guards,	1
renounced	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
exile.	1
Then	1
the	1
skillful	1
statesmen	1
and	1
diplomatists	1
(especially	1
Talleyrand,	1
who	1
managed	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
chair	1
before	1
anyone	1
else	1
and	1
thereby	1
extended	1
the	1
frontiers	1
of	1
France)	1
talked	1
in	1
Vienna	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
conversations	1
made	1
the	1
nations	1
happy	1
or	1
unhappy.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
diplomatists	1
and	1
monarchs	1
nearly	1
quarreled	1
and	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
again	1
ordering	1
their	1
armies	1
to	1
kill	1
one	1
another,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
Napoleon	1
arrived	1
in	1
France	1
with	1
a	1
battalion,	1
and	1
the	1
French,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
hating	1
him,	1
immediately	1
all	1
submitted	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
the	1
Allied	1
monarchs	1
were	1
angry	1
at	1
this	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
French	1
once	1
more.	1
And	1
they	1
defeated	1
the	1
genius	1
Napoleon	1
and,	1
suddenly	1
recognizing	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brigand,	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
St.	1
Helena.	1
And	1
the	1
exile,	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
beloved	1
France	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
his	1
heart,	1
died	1
a	1
lingering	1
death	1
on	1
that	1
rock	1
and	1
bequeathed	1
his	1
great	1
deeds	1
to	1
posterity.	1
But	1
in	1
Europe	1
a	1
reaction	1
occurred	1
and	1
the	1
sovereigns	1
once	1
again	1
all	1
began	1
to	1
oppress	1
their	1
subjects."	1
	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
mistake	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
ironic--a	1
caricature	1
of	1
the	1
historical	1
accounts.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
mild	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
contradictory	1
replies,	1
not	1
meeting	1
the	1
questions,	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
historians	1
give,	1
from	1
the	1
compilers	1
of	1
memoirs	1
and	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
separate	1
states	1
to	1
the	1
writers	1
of	1
general	1
histories	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
histories	1
of	1
the	1
culture	1
of	1
that	1
period.	1
	1
The	1
strangeness	1
and	1
absurdity	1
of	1
these	1
replies	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
modern	1
history,	1
like	1
a	1
deaf	1
man,	1
answers	1
questions	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
asked.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
history	1
be	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
peoples,	1
the	1
first	1
question--in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
will	1
be	1
incomprehensible--is:	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
that	1
moves	1
peoples?	1
To	1
this,	1
modern	1
history	1
laboriously	1
replies	1
either	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
genius,	1
or	1
that	1
Louis	1
XIV	1
was	1
very	1
proud,	1
or	1
that	1
certain	1
writers	1
wrote	1
certain	1
books.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
mankind	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
was	1
asked.	1
All	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
interesting	1
if	1
we	1
recognized	1
a	1
divine	1
power	1
based	1
on	1
itself	1
and	1
always	1
consistently	1
directing	1
its	1
nations	1
through	1
Napoleons,	1
Louis-es,	1
and	1
writers;	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
such	1
a	1
power,	1
and	1
therefore	1
before	1
speaking	1
about	1
Napoleons,	1
Louis-es,	1
and	1
authors,	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
shown	1
the	1
connection	1
existing	1
between	1
these	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
If	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
divine	1
power	1
some	1
other	1
force	1
has	1
appeared,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
explained	1
in	1
what	1
this	1
new	1
force	1
consists,	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
interest	1
of	1
history	1
lies	1
precisely	1
in	1
that	1
force.	1
	1
History	1
seems	1
to	1
assume	1
that	1
this	1
force	1
is	1
self-evident	1
and	1
known	1
to	1
everyone.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
every	1
desire	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
known,	1
anyone	1
reading	1
many	1
historical	1
works	1
cannot	1
help	1
doubting	1
whether	1
this	1
new	1
force,	1
so	1
variously	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
historians	1
themselves,	1
is	1
really	1
quite	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
everybody.	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
What	1
force	1
moves	1
the	1
nations?	1
	1
Biographical	1
historians	1
and	1
historians	1
of	1
separate	1
nations	1
understand	1
this	1
force	1
as	1
a	1
power	1
inherent	1
in	1
heroes	1
and	1
rulers.	1
In	1
their	1
narration	1
events	1
occur	1
solely	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
Alexander,	1
or	1
in	1
general	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
they	1
describe.	1
The	1
answers	1
given	1
by	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
historian	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
what	1
force	1
causes	1
events	1
to	1
happen	1
are	1
satisfactory	1
only	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
historian	1
to	1
each	1
event.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
historians	1
of	1
different	1
nationalities	1
and	1
tendencies	1
begin	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
same	1
event,	1
the	1
replies	1
they	1
give	1
immediately	1
lose	1
all	1
meaning,	1
for	1
this	1
force	1
is	1
understood	1
by	1
them	1
all	1
not	1
only	1
differently	1
but	1
often	1
in	1
quite	1
contradictory	1
ways.	1
One	1
historian	1
says	1
that	1
an	1
event	1
was	1
produced	1
by	1
Napoleon's	1
power,	1
another	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
produced	1
by	1
Alexander's,	1
a	1
third	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
person.	1
Besides	1
this,	1
historians	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
contradict	1
each	1
other	1
even	1
in	1
their	1
statement	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
some	1
particular	1
person	1
was	1
based.	1
Thiers,	1
a	1
Bonapartist,	1
says	1
that	1
Napoleon's	1
power	1
was	1
based	1
on	1
his	1
virtue	1
and	1
genius.	1
Lanfrey,	1
a	1
Republican,	1
says	1
it	1
was	1
based	1
on	1
his	1
trickery	1
and	1
deception	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
So	1
the	1
historians	1
of	1
this	1
class,	1
by	1
mutually	1
destroying	1
one	1
another's	1
positions,	1
destroy	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
which	1
produces	1
events,	1
and	1
furnish	1
no	1
reply	1
to	1
history's	1
essential	1
question.	1
	1
Writers	1
of	1
universal	1
history	1
who	1
deal	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
seem	1
to	1
recognize	1
how	1
erroneous	1
is	1
the	1
specialist	1
historians'	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
which	1
produces	1
events.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
recognize	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
power	1
inherent	1
in	1
heroes	1
and	1
rulers,	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
resultant	1
of	1
a	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
variously	1
directed	1
forces.	1
In	1
describing	1
a	1
war	1
or	1
the	1
subjugation	1
of	1
a	1
people,	1
a	1
general	1
historian	1
looks	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
interaction	1
of	1
many	1
persons	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
According	1
to	1
this	1
view	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
historical	1
personages,	1
represented	1
as	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
many	1
forces,	1
can	1
no	1
longer,	1
it	1
would	1
seem,	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
that	1
itself	1
produces	1
events.	1
Yet	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
universal	1
historians	1
still	1
employ	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
power	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
that	1
itself	1
produces	1
events,	1
and	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
their	1
cause.	1
In	1
their	1
exposition,	1
an	1
historic	1
character	1
is	1
first	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
his	1
time,	1
and	1
his	1
power	1
only	1
the	1
resultant	1
of	1
various	1
forces,	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
power	1
is	1
itself	1
a	1
force	1
producing	1
events.	1
Gervinus,	1
Schlosser,	1
and	1
others,	1
for	1
instance,	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
prove	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
product	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
of	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
1789	1
and	1
so	1
forth,	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
plainly	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
were	1
simply	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
misdirected	1
will,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
ideas	1
of	1
1789	1
were	1
arrested	1
in	1
their	1
development	1
by	1
Napoleon's	1
caprice.	1
The	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
temper	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
produced	1
Napoleon's	1
power.	1
But	1
Napoleon's	1
power	1
suppressed	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
temper	1
of	1
the	1
age.	1
	1
This	1
curious	1
contradiction	1
is	1
not	1
accidental.	1
Not	1
only	1
does	1
it	1
occur	1
at	1
every	1
step,	1
but	1
the	1
universal	1
historians'	1
accounts	1
are	1
all	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
such	1
contradictions.	1
This	1
contradiction	1
occurs	1
because	1
after	1
entering	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
analysis	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
stop	1
halfway.	1
	1
To	1
find	1
component	1
forces	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
composite	1
or	1
resultant	1
force,	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
components	1
must	1
equal	1
the	1
resultant.	1
This	1
condition	1
is	1
never	1
observed	1
by	1
the	1
universal	1
historians,	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
resultant	1
forces	1
they	1
are	1
obliged	1
to	1
admit,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
insufficient	1
components,	1
another	1
unexplained	1
force	1
affecting	1
the	1
resultant	1
action.	1
	1
Specialist	1
historians	1
describing	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1813	1
or	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
plainly	1
assert	1
that	1
these	1
events	1
were	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
Alexander.	1
But	1
the	1
universal	1
historian	1
Gervinus,	1
refuting	1
this	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
specialist	1
historian,	1
tries	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1813	1
and	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
were	1
due	1
to	1
other	1
things	1
beside	1
Alexander's	1
will--such	1
as	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
Stein,	1
Metternich,	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
Talleyrand,	1
Fichte,	1
Chateaubriand,	1
and	1
others.	1
The	1
historian	1
evidently	1
decomposes	1
Alexander's	1
power	1
into	1
the	1
components:	1
Talleyrand,	1
Chateaubriand,	1
and	1
the	1
rest--but	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
components,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
interactions	1
of	1
Chateaubriand,	1
Talleyrand,	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
and	1
the	1
others,	1
evidently	1
does	1
not	1
equal	1
the	1
resultant,	1
namely	1
the	1
phenomenon	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
Frenchmen	1
submitting	1
to	1
the	1
Bourbons.	1
That	1
Chateaubriand,	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
and	1
others	1
spoke	1
certain	1
words	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
only	1
affected	1
their	1
mutual	1
relations	1
but	1
does	1
not	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
submission	1
of	1
millions.	1
And	1
therefore	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
from	1
these	1
relations	1
of	1
theirs	1
the	1
submission	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
people	1
resulted--that	1
is,	1
how	1
component	1
forces	1
equal	1
to	1
one	1
A	1
gave	1
a	1
resultant	1
equal	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
A--the	1
historian	1
is	1
again	1
obliged	1
to	1
fall	1
back	1
on	1
power--the	1
force	1
he	1
had	1
denied--and	1
to	1
recognize	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
resultant	1
of	1
the	1
forces,	1
that	1
is,	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
admit	1
an	1
unexplained	1
force	1
acting	1
on	1
the	1
resultant.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
do,	1
and	1
consequently	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
contradict	1
the	1
specialist	1
historians	1
but	1
contradict	1
themselves.	1
	1
Peasants	1
having	1
no	1
clear	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
rain,	1
say,	1
according	1
to	1
whether	1
they	1
want	1
rain	1
or	1
fine	1
weather:	1
"The	1
wind	1
has	1
blown	1
the	1
clouds	1
away,"	1
or,	1
"The	1
wind	1
has	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
clouds."	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
sometimes,	1
when	1
it	1
pleases	1
them	1
and	1
fits	1
in	1
with	1
their	1
theory,	1
say	1
that	1
power	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
sometimes,	1
when	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
prove	1
something	1
else,	1
say	1
that	1
power	1
produces	1
events.	1
	1
A	1
third	1
class	1
of	1
historians--the	1
so-called	1
historians	1
of	1
culture--	1
following	1
the	1
path	1
laid	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
who	1
sometimes	1
accept	1
writers	1
and	1
ladies	1
as	1
forces	1
producing	1
events--again	1
take	1
that	1
force	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
quite	1
different.	1
They	1
see	1
it	1
in	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
culture--in	1
mental	1
activity.	1
	1
The	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
are	1
quite	1
consistent	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
their	1
progenitors,	1
the	1
writers	1
of	1
universal	1
histories,	1
for	1
if	1
historical	1
events	1
may	1
be	1
explained	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
certain	1
persons	1
treated	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
ways,	1
why	1
not	1
explain	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
people	1
wrote	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
books?	1
Of	1
the	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
indications	1
accompanying	1
every	1
vital	1
phenomenon,	1
these	1
historians	1
select	1
the	1
indication	1
of	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
indication	1
is	1
the	1
cause.	1
But	1
despite	1
their	1
endeavors	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
events	1
lies	1
in	1
intellectual	1
activity,	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
stretch	1
can	1
one	1
admit	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
connection	1
between	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
and	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
peoples,	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
can	1
one	1
admit	1
that	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
controls	1
people's	1
actions,	1
for	1
that	1
view	1
is	1
not	1
confirmed	1
by	1
such	1
facts	1
as	1
the	1
very	1
cruel	1
murders	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution	1
resulting	1
from	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
equality	1
of	1
man,	1
or	1
the	1
very	1
cruel	1
wars	1
and	1
executions	1
resulting	1
from	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
love.	1
	1
But	1
even	1
admitting	1
as	1
correct	1
all	1
the	1
cunningly	1
devised	1
arguments	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
histories	1
are	1
filled--admitting	1
that	1
nations	1
are	1
governed	1
by	1
some	1
undefined	1
force	1
called	1
an	1
idea--history's	1
essential	1
question	1
still	1
remains	1
unanswered,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
power	1
of	1
monarchs	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
advisers	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
introduced	1
by	1
the	1
universal	1
historians,	1
another,	1
newer	1
force--the	1
idea--is	1
added,	1
the	1
connection	1
of	1
which	1
with	1
the	1
masses	1
needs	1
explanation.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
power	1
and	1
so	1
events	1
occurred;	1
with	1
some	1
effort	1
one	1
may	1
even	1
conceive	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
together	1
with	1
other	1
influences	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
an	1
event;	1
but	1
how	1
a	1
book,	1
Le	1
Contrat	1
Social,	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
making	1
Frenchmen	1
begin	1
to	1
drown	1
one	1
another	1
cannot	1
be	1
understood	1
without	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
causal	1
nexus	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
force	1
with	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
Undoubtedly	1
some	1
relation	1
exists	1
between	1
all	1
who	1
live	1
contemporaneously,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
their	1
historical	1
movements,	1
just	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
connection	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
between	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
humanity	1
and	1
commerce,	1
handicraft,	1
gardening,	1
or	1
anything	1
else	1
you	1
please.	1
But	1
why	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
is	1
considered	1
by	1
the	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
or	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
historical	1
movement	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
understand.	1
Only	1
the	1
following	1
considerations	1
can	1
have	1
led	1
the	1
historians	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
conclusion:	1
(1)	1
that	1
history	1
is	1
written	1
by	1
learned	1
men,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
natural	1
and	1
agreeable	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
their	1
class	1
supplies	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
all	1
humanity,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
similar	1
belief	1
is	1
natural	1
and	1
agreeable	1
to	1
traders,	1
agriculturists,	1
and	1
soldiers	1
(if	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
express	1
it,	1
that	1
is	1
merely	1
because	1
traders	1
and	1
soldiers	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
history),	1
and	1
(2)	1
that	1
spiritual	1
activity,	1
enlightenment,	1
civilization,	1
culture,	1
ideas,	1
are	1
all	1
indistinct,	1
indefinite	1
conceptions	1
under	1
whose	1
banner	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
use	1
words	1
having	1
a	1
still	1
less	1
definite	1
meaning,	1
and	1
which	1
can	1
therefore	1
be	1
readily	1
introduced	1
into	1
any	1
theory.	1
	1
But	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
intrinsic	1
quality	1
of	1
histories	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
(which	1
may	1
possibly	1
even	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
someone	1
for	1
something)	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
culture,	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
general	1
histories	1
tend	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
approximate,	1
are	1
significant	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
after	1
seriously	1
and	1
minutely	1
examining	1
various	1
religious,	1
philosophic,	1
and	1
political	1
doctrines	1
as	1
causes	1
of	1
events,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
describe	1
an	1
actual	1
historic	1
event	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812	1
for	1
instance,	1
they	1
involuntarily	1
describe	1
it	1
as	1
resulting	1
from	1
an	1
exercise	1
of	1
power--and	1
say	1
plainly	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
will.	1
Speaking	1
so,	1
the	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
involuntarily	1
contradict	1
themselves,	1
and	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
force	1
they	1
have	1
devised	1
does	1
not	1
account	1
for	1
what	1
happens	1
in	1
history,	1
and	1
that	1
history	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
explained	1
by	1
introducing	1
a	1
power	1
which	1
they	1
apparently	1
do	1
not	1
recognize.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
A	1
locomotive	1
is	1
moving.	1
Someone	1
asks:	1
"What	1
moves	1
it?"	1
A	1
peasant	1
says	1
the	1
devil	1
moves	1
it.	1
Another	1
man	1
says	1
the	1
locomotive	1
moves	1
because	1
its	1
wheels	1
go	1
round.	1
A	1
third	1
asserts	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
its	1
movement	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
smoke	1
which	1
the	1
wind	1
carries	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
peasant	1
is	1
irrefutable.	1
He	1
has	1
devised	1
a	1
complete	1
explanation.	1
To	1
refute	1
him	1
someone	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
devil,	1
or	1
another	1
peasant	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
devil	1
but	1
a	1
German,	1
who	1
moves	1
the	1
locomotive.	1
Only	1
then,	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
contradiction,	1
will	1
they	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
both	1
wrong.	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
refutes	1
himself,	1
for	1
having	1
once	1
begun	1
to	1
analyze	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
explain	1
further	1
why	1
the	1
wheels	1
go	1
round;	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
has	1
reached	1
the	1
ultimate	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
locomotive	1
in	1
the	1
pressure	1
of	1
steam	1
in	1
the	1
boiler,	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
stop	1
in	1
his	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
cause.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
explains	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
locomotive	1
by	1
the	1
smoke	1
that	1
is	1
carried	1
back	1
has	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
wheels	1
do	1
not	1
supply	1
an	1
explanation	1
and	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
first	1
sign	1
that	1
occurs	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
turn	1
has	1
offered	1
that	1
as	1
an	1
explanation.	1
	1
The	1
only	1
conception	1
that	1
can	1
explain	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
locomotive	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
force	1
commensurate	1
with	1
the	1
movement	1
observed.	1
	1
The	1
only	1
conception	1
that	1
can	1
explain	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
some	1
force	1
commensurate	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples.	1
	1
Yet	1
to	1
supply	1
this	1
conception	1
various	1
historians	1
take	1
forces	1
of	1
different	1
kinds,	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
incommensurate	1
with	1
the	1
movement	1
observed.	1
Some	1
see	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
directly	1
inherent	1
in	1
heroes,	1
as	1
the	1
peasant	1
sees	1
the	1
devil	1
in	1
the	1
locomotive;	1
others	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
resulting	1
from	1
several	1
other	1
forces,	1
like	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
wheels;	1
others	1
again	1
as	1
an	1
intellectual	1
influence,	1
like	1
the	1
smoke	1
that	1
is	1
blown	1
away.	1
	1
So	1
long	1
as	1
histories	1
are	1
written	1
of	1
separate	1
individuals,	1
whether	1
Caesars,	1
Alexanders,	1
Luthers,	1
or	1
Voltaires,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
all,	1
absolutely	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
an	1
event,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity	1
without	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
force	1
compelling	1
men	1
to	1
direct	1
their	1
activity	1
toward	1
a	1
certain	1
end.	1
And	1
the	1
only	1
such	1
conception	1
known	1
to	1
historians	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
power.	1
	1
This	1
conception	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
handle	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
material	1
of	1
history,	1
as	1
at	1
present	1
expounded,	1
can	1
be	1
dealt	1
with,	1
and	1
anyone	1
who	1
breaks	1
that	1
handle	1
off,	1
as	1
Buckle	1
did,	1
without	1
finding	1
some	1
other	1
method	1
of	1
treating	1
historical	1
material,	1
merely	1
deprives	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
possible	1
way	1
of	1
dealing	1
with	1
it.	1
The	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
power	1
as	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
historical	1
events	1
is	1
best	1
demonstrated	1
by	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
and	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
themselves,	1
for	1
they	1
professedly	1
reject	1
that	1
conception	1
but	1
inevitably	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
it	1
at	1
every	1
step.	1
	1
In	1
dealing	1
with	1
humanity's	1
inquiry,	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
history	1
up	1
to	1
now	1
is	1
like	1
money	1
in	1
circulation--paper	1
money	1
and	1
coin.	1
The	1
biographies	1
and	1
special	1
national	1
histories	1
are	1
like	1
paper	1
money.	1
They	1
can	1
be	1
used	1
and	1
can	1
circulate	1
and	1
fulfill	1
their	1
purpose	1
without	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
even	1
advantageously,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
asks	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
security	1
behind	1
them.	1
You	1
need	1
only	1
forget	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
heroes	1
produces	1
events,	1
and	1
such	1
histories	1
as	1
Thiers'	1
will	1
be	1
interesting	1
and	1
instructive	1
and	1
may	1
perhaps	1
even	1
possess	1
a	1
tinge	1
of	1
poetry.	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
doubts	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
value	1
of	1
paper	1
money	1
arise	1
either	1
because,	1
being	1
easy	1
to	1
make,	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
gets	1
made	1
or	1
because	1
people	1
try	1
to	1
exchange	1
it	1
for	1
gold,	1
so	1
also	1
doubts	1
concerning	1
the	1
real	1
value	1
of	1
such	1
histories	1
arise	1
either	1
because	1
too	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
written	1
or	1
because	1
in	1
his	1
simplicity	1
of	1
heart	1
someone	1
inquires:	1
by	1
what	1
force	1
did	1
Napoleon	1
do	1
this?--that	1
is,	1
wants	1
to	1
exchange	1
the	1
current	1
paper	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
real	1
gold	1
of	1
actual	1
comprehension.	1
	1
The	1
writers	1
of	1
universal	1
histories	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
culture	1
are	1
like	1
people	1
who,	1
recognizing	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
paper	1
money,	1
decide	1
to	1
substitute	1
for	1
it	1
money	1
made	1
of	1
metal	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
specific	1
gravity	1
of	1
gold.	1
It	1
may	1
indeed	1
make	1
jingling	1
coin,	1
but	1
will	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
that.	1
Paper	1
money	1
may	1
deceive	1
the	1
ignorant,	1
but	1
nobody	1
is	1
deceived	1
by	1
tokens	1
of	1
base	1
metal	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
value	1
but	1
merely	1
jingle.	1
As	1
gold	1
is	1
gold	1
only	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
serviceable	1
not	1
merely	1
for	1
exchange	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
use,	1
so	1
universal	1
historians	1
will	1
be	1
valuable	1
only	1
when	1
they	1
can	1
reply	1
to	1
history's	1
essential	1
question:	1
what	1
is	1
power?	1
The	1
universal	1
historians	1
give	1
contradictory	1
replies	1
to	1
that	1
question,	1
while	1
the	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
evade	1
it	1
and	1
answer	1
something	1
quite	1
different.	1
And	1
as	1
counters	1
of	1
imitation	1
gold	1
can	1
be	1
used	1
only	1
among	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
agree	1
to	1
accept	1
them	1
as	1
gold,	1
or	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
gold,	1
so	1
universal	1
historians	1
and	1
historians	1
of	1
culture,	1
not	1
answering	1
humanity's	1
essential	1
question,	1
serve	1
as	1
currency	1
for	1
some	1
purposes	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
only	1
in	1
universities	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
readers	1
who	1
have	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
"serious	1
reading."	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Having	1
abandoned	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
divine	1
subjection	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
nation	1
to	1
some	1
chosen	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
subjection	1
of	1
that	1
man's	1
will	1
to	1
the	1
Deity,	1
history	1
cannot	1
without	1
contradictions	1
take	1
a	1
single	1
step	1
till	1
it	1
has	1
chosen	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
things:	1
either	1
a	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
direct	1
intervention	1
of	1
the	1
Deity	1
in	1
human	1
affairs	1
or	1
a	1
definite	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
producing	1
historical	1
events	1
and	1
termed	1
"power."	1
	1
A	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
impossible,	1
the	1
belief	1
has	1
been	1
destroyed;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
explain	1
what	1
is	1
meant	1
by	1
power.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
ordered	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
war.	1
We	1
are	1
so	1
accustomed	1
to	1
that	1
idea	1
and	1
have	1
become	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
question:	1
why	1
did	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
go	1
to	1
fight	1
when	1
Napoleon	1
uttered	1
certain	1
words,	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
senseless.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
so	1
what	1
he	1
ordered	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
This	1
reply	1
is	1
quite	1
satisfactory	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
God.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
admit	1
that,	1
it	1
becomes	1
essential	1
to	1
determine	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
power	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
over	1
others.	1
	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
direct	1
physical	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
over	1
a	1
weak	1
one--	1
a	1
domination	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
application	1
or	1
threat	1
of	1
physical	1
force,	1
like	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Hercules;	1
nor	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
moral	1
force,	1
as	1
in	1
their	1
simplicity	1
some	1
historians	1
think	1
who	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
leading	1
figures	1
in	1
history	1
are	1
heroes,	1
that	1
is,	1
men	1
gifted	1
with	1
a	1
special	1
strength	1
of	1
soul	1
and	1
mind	1
called	1
genius.	1
This	1
power	1
cannot	1
be	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
predominance	1
of	1
moral	1
strength,	1
for,	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
heroes	1
such	1
as	1
Napoleon	1
about	1
whose	1
moral	1
qualities	1
opinions	1
differ	1
widely,	1
history	1
shows	1
us	1
that	1
neither	1
a	1
Louis	1
XI	1
nor	1
a	1
Metternich,	1
who	1
ruled	1
over	1
millions	1
of	1
people,	1
had	1
any	1
particular	1
moral	1
qualities,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
were	1
generally	1
morally	1
weaker	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
millions	1
they	1
ruled	1
over.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
power	1
lies	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
physical	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
moral	1
qualities	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
possesses	1
it,	1
it	1
must	1
evidently	1
be	1
looked	1
for	1
elsewhere--in	1
the	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
wields	1
the	1
power.	1
	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
power	1
is	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
jurisprudence,	1
that	1
exchange	1
bank	1
of	1
history	1
which	1
offers	1
to	1
exchange	1
history's	1
understanding	1
of	1
power	1
for	1
true	1
gold.	1
	1
Power	1
is	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
transferred,	1
by	1
expressed	1
or	1
tacit	1
consent,	1
to	1
their	1
chosen	1
rulers.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
domain	1
of	1
jurisprudence,	1
which	1
consists	1
of	1
discussions	1
of	1
how	1
a	1
state	1
and	1
power	1
might	1
be	1
arranged	1
were	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
arranged,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
clear;	1
but	1
when	1
applied	1
to	1
history	1
that	1
definition	1
of	1
power	1
needs	1
explanation.	1
	1
The	1
science	1
of	1
jurisprudence	1
regards	1
the	1
state	1
and	1
power	1
as	1
the	1
ancients	1
regarded	1
fire--namely,	1
as	1
something	1
existing	1
absolutely.	1
But	1
for	1
history,	1
the	1
state	1
and	1
power	1
are	1
merely	1
phenomena,	1
just	1
as	1
for	1
modern	1
physics	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
element	1
but	1
a	1
phenomenon.	1
	1
From	1
this	1
fundamental	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
view	1
held	1
by	1
history	1
and	1
that	1
held	1
by	1
jurisprudence,	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
jurisprudence	1
can	1
tell	1
minutely	1
how	1
in	1
its	1
opinion	1
power	1
should	1
be	1
constituted	1
and	1
what	1
power--	1
existing	1
immutably	1
outside	1
time--is,	1
but	1
to	1
history's	1
questions	1
about	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
mutations	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
time	1
it	1
can	1
answer	1
nothing.	1
	1
If	1
power	1
be	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
transferred	1
to	1
their	1
ruler,	1
was	1
Pugachev	1
a	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people?	1
If	1
not,	1
then	1
why	1
was	1
Napoleon	1
I?	1
Why	1
was	1
Napoleon	1
III	1
a	1
criminal	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
at	1
Boulogne,	1
and	1
why,	1
later	1
on,	1
were	1
those	1
criminals	1
whom	1
he	1
arrested?	1
	1
Do	1
palace	1
revolutions--in	1
which	1
sometimes	1
only	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
people	1
take	1
part--transfer	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
ruler?	1
In	1
international	1
relations,	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
also	1
transferred	1
to	1
their	1
conqueror?	1
Was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine	1
transferred	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
1806?	1
Was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
transferred	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
1809,	1
when	1
our	1
army	1
in	1
alliance	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
went	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
Austrians?	1
	1
To	1
these	1
questions	1
three	1
answers	1
are	1
possible:	1
	1
Either	1
to	1
assume	1
(1)	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
always	1
unconditionally	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
ruler	1
or	1
rulers	1
they	1
have	1
chosen,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
every	1
emergence	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
power,	1
every	1
struggle	1
against	1
the	1
power	1
once	1
appointed,	1
should	1
be	1
absolutely	1
regarded	1
as	1
an	1
infringement	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
power;	1
or	1
(2)	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
rulers	1
conditionally,	1
under	1
definite	1
and	1
known	1
conditions,	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
all	1
limitations,	1
conflicts,	1
and	1
even	1
destructions	1
of	1
power	1
result	1
from	1
a	1
nonobservance	1
by	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
under	1
which	1
their	1
power	1
was	1
entrusted	1
to	1
them;	1
or	1
(3)	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
delegated	1
to	1
the	1
rulers	1
conditionally,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
conditions	1
are	1
unknown	1
and	1
indefinite,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
several	1
authorities,	1
their	1
struggles	1
and	1
their	1
falls,	1
result	1
solely	1
from	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
fulfillment	1
by	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
these	1
unknown	1
conditions	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
transferred	1
from	1
some	1
people	1
to	1
others.	1
	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
three	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
historians	1
do	1
explain	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
their	1
rulers.	1
	1
Some	1
historians--those	1
biographical	1
and	1
specialist	1
historians	1
already	1
referred	1
to--in	1
their	1
simplicity	1
failing	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
power,	1
seem	1
to	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
unconditionally	1
transferred	1
to	1
historical	1
persons,	1
and	1
therefore	1
when	1
describing	1
some	1
single	1
state	1
they	1
assume	1
that	1
particular	1
power	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
one	1
absolute	1
and	1
real	1
power,	1
and	1
that	1
any	1
other	1
force	1
opposing	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
power	1
but	1
a	1
violation	1
of	1
power--mere	1
violence.	1
	1
Their	1
theory,	1
suitable	1
for	1
primitive	1
and	1
peaceful	1
periods	1
of	1
history,	1
has	1
the	1
inconvenience--in	1
application	1
to	1
complex	1
and	1
stormy	1
periods	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
nations	1
during	1
which	1
various	1
powers	1
arise	1
simultaneously	1
and	1
struggle	1
with	1
one	1
another--that	1
a	1
Legitimist	1
historian	1
will	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
National	1
Convention,	1
the	1
Directory,	1
and	1
Bonaparte	1
were	1
mere	1
infringers	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
power,	1
while	1
a	1
Republican	1
and	1
a	1
Bonapartist	1
will	1
prove:	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
the	1
Convention	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
the	1
Empire	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
power,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
violations	1
of	1
power.	1
Evidently	1
the	1
explanations	1
furnished	1
by	1
these	1
historians	1
being	1
mutually	1
contradictory	1
can	1
only	1
satisfy	1
young	1
children.	1
	1
Recognizing	1
the	1
falsity	1
of	1
this	1
view	1
of	1
history,	1
another	1
set	1
of	1
historians	1
say	1
that	1
power	1
rests	1
on	1
a	1
conditional	1
delegation	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
their	1
rulers,	1
and	1
that	1
historical	1
leaders	1
have	1
power	1
only	1
conditionally	1
on	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
program	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
has	1
by	1
tacit	1
agreement	1
prescribed	1
to	1
them.	1
But	1
what	1
this	1
program	1
consists	1
in	1
these	1
historians	1
do	1
not	1
say,	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
they	1
continually	1
contradict	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Each	1
historian,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
what	1
constitutes	1
a	1
nation's	1
progress,	1
looks	1
for	1
these	1
conditions	1
in	1
the	1
greatness,	1
wealth,	1
freedom,	1
or	1
enlightenment	1
of	1
citizens	1
of	1
France	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
country.	1
But	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
the	1
historians'	1
contradictions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
this	1
program-	1
-or	1
even	1
admitting	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
general	1
program	1
of	1
these	1
conditions	1
exists--the	1
facts	1
of	1
history	1
almost	1
always	1
contradict	1
that	1
theory.	1
If	1
the	1
conditions	1
under	1
which	1
power	1
is	1
entrusted	1
consist	1
in	1
the	1
wealth,	1
freedom,	1
and	1
enlightenment	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
Louis	1
XIV	1
and	1
Ivan	1
the	1
Terrible	1
end	1
their	1
reigns	1
tranquilly,	1
while	1
Louis	1
XVI	1
and	1
Charles	1
I	1
are	1
executed	1
by	1
their	1
people?	1
To	1
this	1
question	1
historians	1
reply	1
that	1
Louis	1
XIV's	1
activity,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
program,	1
reacted	1
on	1
Louis	1
XVI.	1
But	1
why	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
react	1
on	1
Louis	1
XIV	1
or	1
on	1
Louis	1
XV--why	1
should	1
it	1
react	1
just	1
on	1
Louis	1
XVI?	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
limit	1
for	1
such	1
reactions?	1
To	1
these	1
questions	1
there	1
are	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
answers.	1
Equally	1
little	1
does	1
this	1
view	1
explain	1
why	1
for	1
several	1
centuries	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
is	1
not	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
certain	1
rulers	1
and	1
their	1
heirs,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
during	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
fifty	1
years	1
is	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Convention,	1
to	1
the	1
Directory,	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
to	1
Alexander,	1
to	1
Louis	1
XVIII,	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
again,	1
to	1
Charles	1
X,	1
to	1
Louis	1
Philippe,	1
to	1
a	1
Republican	1
government,	1
and	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
III.	1
When	1
explaining	1
these	1
rapid	1
transfers	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will	1
from	1
one	1
individual	1
to	1
another,	1
especially	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
international	1
relations,	1
conquests,	1
and	1
alliances,	1
the	1
historians	1
are	1
obliged	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
transfers	1
are	1
not	1
normal	1
delegations	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will	1
but	1
are	1
accidents	1
dependent	1
on	1
cunning,	1
on	1
mistakes,	1
on	1
craft,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
a	1
diplomatist,	1
a	1
ruler,	1
or	1
a	1
party	1
leader.	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
history--civil	1
wars,	1
revolutions,	1
and	1
conquests--are	1
presented	1
by	1
these	1
historians	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
free	1
transferences	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will,	1
but	1
as	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
ill-directed	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
more	1
individuals,	1
that	1
is,	1
once	1
again,	1
as	1
usurpations	1
of	1
power.	1
And	1
so	1
these	1
historians	1
also	1
see	1
and	1
admit	1
historical	1
events	1
which	1
are	1
exceptions	1
to	1
the	1
theory.	1
	1
These	1
historians	1
resemble	1
a	1
botanist	1
who,	1
having	1
noticed	1
that	1
some	1
plants	1
grow	1
from	1
seeds	1
producing	1
two	1
cotyledons,	1
should	1
insist	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
grows	1
does	1
so	1
by	1
sprouting	1
into	1
two	1
leaves,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
palm,	1
the	1
mushroom,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
oak,	1
which	1
blossom	1
into	1
full	1
growth	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
resemble	1
two	1
leaves,	1
are	1
deviations	1
from	1
the	1
theory.	1
	1
Historians	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
class	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
transferred	1
to	1
historic	1
personages	1
conditionally,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
conditions	1
are	1
unknown	1
to	1
us.	1
They	1
say	1
that	1
historical	1
personages	1
have	1
power	1
only	1
because	1
they	1
fulfill	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
delegated	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
But	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
if	1
the	1
force	1
that	1
moves	1
nations	1
lies	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
historic	1
leaders	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
nations	1
themselves,	1
what	1
significance	1
have	1
those	1
leaders?	1
	1
The	1
leaders,	1
these	1
historians	1
tell	1
us,	1
express	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
leaders	1
represents	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
But	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
the	1
question	1
arises	1
whether	1
all	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
leaders	1
serves	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will	1
or	1
only	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
leaders	1
serves	1
as	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will,	1
as	1
some	1
historians	1
suppose,	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
scandals	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
biographies	1
of	1
a	1
Napoleon	1
or	1
a	1
Catherine	1
serve	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
which	1
is	1
evident	1
nonsense;	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
some	1
particular	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
an	1
historical	1
leader	1
which	1
serves	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
people's	1
life,	1
as	1
other	1
so-called	1
"philosophical"	1
historians	1
believe,	1
then	1
to	1
determine	1
which	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
a	1
leader	1
expresses	1
the	1
nation's	1
life,	1
we	1
have	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
know	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
nation's	1
life	1
consists.	1
	1
Met	1
by	1
this	1
difficulty	1
historians	1
of	1
that	1
class	1
devise	1
some	1
most	1
obscure,	1
impalpable,	1
and	1
general	1
abstraction	1
which	1
can	1
cover	1
all	1
conceivable	1
occurrences,	1
and	1
declare	1
this	1
abstraction	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
humanity's	1
movement.	1
The	1
most	1
usual	1
generalizations	1
adopted	1
by	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
historians	1
are:	1
freedom,	1
equality,	1
enlightenment,	1
progress,	1
civilization,	1
and	1
culture.	1
Postulating	1
some	1
generalization	1
as	1
the	1
goal	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity,	1
the	1
historians	1
study	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
greatest	1
number	1
of	1
monuments	1
have	1
remained:	1
kings,	1
ministers,	1
generals,	1
authors,	1
reformers,	1
popes,	1
and	1
journalists,	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
to	1
which	1
in	1
their	1
opinion	1
these	1
persons	1
have	1
promoted	1
or	1
hindered	1
that	1
abstraction.	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
humanity	1
does	1
consist	1
in	1
freedom,	1
equality,	1
enlightenment,	1
or	1
civilization,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
connection	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
rulers	1
and	1
enlighteners	1
of	1
humanity	1
is	1
only	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
arbitrary	1
assumption	1
that	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
always	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
noticed,	1
it	1
happens	1
that	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
millions	1
who	1
migrate,	1
burn	1
houses,	1
abandon	1
agriculture,	1
and	1
destroy	1
one	1
another	1
never	1
is	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
some	1
dozen	1
people	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
burn	1
houses,	1
practice	1
agriculture,	1
or	1
slay	1
their	1
fellow	1
creatures.	1
	1
History	1
proves	1
this	1
at	1
every	1
turn.	1
Is	1
the	1
ferment	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century	1
and	1
their	1
drive	1
eastward	1
explained	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
Louis	1
XIV,	1
XV,	1
and	1
XVI,	1
their	1
mistresses	1
and	1
ministers,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
Rousseau,	1
Diderot,	1
Beaumarchais,	1
and	1
others?	1
	1
Is	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
eastward	1
to	1
Kazan	1
and	1
Siberia	1
expressed	1
by	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
morbid	1
character	1
of	1
Ivan	1
the	1
Terrible	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
correspondence	1
with	1
Kurbski?	1
	1
Is	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
Crusades	1
explained	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
Godfreys	1
and	1
the	1
Louis-es	1
and	1
their	1
ladies?	1
For	1
us	1
that	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east,	1
without	1
leaders,	1
with	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
vagrants,	1
and	1
with	1
Peter	1
the	1
Hermit,	1
remains	1
incomprehensible.	1
And	1
yet	1
more	1
incomprehensible	1
is	1
the	1
cessation	1
of	1
that	1
movement	1
when	1
a	1
rational	1
and	1
sacred	1
aim	1
for	1
the	1
Crusade--the	1
deliverance	1
of	1
Jerusalem--had	1
been	1
clearly	1
defined	1
by	1
historic	1
leaders.	1
Popes,	1
kings,	1
and	1
knights	1
incited	1
the	1
peoples	1
to	1
free	1
the	1
Holy	1
Land;	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
go,	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
cause	1
which	1
had	1
previously	1
impelled	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
no	1
longer	1
existed.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
Godfreys	1
and	1
the	1
Minnesingers	1
can	1
evidently	1
not	1
cover	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
peoples.	1
And	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
Godfreys	1
and	1
the	1
Minnesingers	1
has	1
remained	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Godfreys	1
and	1
Minnesingers,	1
but	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
and	1
their	1
impulses	1
has	1
remained	1
unknown.	1
	1
Still	1
less	1
does	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
authors	1
and	1
reformers	1
explain	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
peoples.	1
	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
culture	1
explains	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
impulses	1
and	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
writer	1
or	1
a	1
reformer.	1
We	1
learn	1
that	1
Luther	1
had	1
a	1
hot	1
temper	1
and	1
said	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
things;	1
we	1
learn	1
that	1
Rousseau	1
was	1
suspicious	1
and	1
wrote	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
books;	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
learn	1
why	1
after	1
the	1
Reformation	1
the	1
peoples	1
massacred	1
one	1
another,	1
nor	1
why	1
during	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution	1
they	1
guillotined	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
If	1
we	1
unite	1
both	1
these	1
kinds	1
of	1
history,	1
as	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
newest	1
historians,	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
monarchs	1
and	1
writers,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
peoples.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
The	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
is	1
not	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
men,	1
for	1
the	1
connection	1
between	1
those	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
nations	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
found.	1
The	1
theory	1
that	1
this	1
connection	1
is	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
to	1
certain	1
historical	1
personages	1
is	1
an	1
hypothesis	1
unconfirmed	1
by	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
The	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
historic	1
persons	1
may	1
perhaps	1
explain	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
domain	1
of	1
jurisprudence	1
and	1
be	1
essential	1
for	1
its	1
purposes,	1
but	1
in	1
its	1
application	1
to	1
history,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
revolutions,	1
conquests,	1
or	1
civil	1
wars	1
occur--that	1
is,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
history	1
begins--that	1
theory	1
explains	1
nothing.	1
	1
The	1
theory	1
seems	1
irrefutable	1
just	1
because	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will	1
cannot	1
be	1
verified,	1
for	1
it	1
never	1
occurred.	1
	1
Whatever	1
happens	1
and	1
whoever	1
may	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
affairs,	1
the	1
theory	1
can	1
always	1
say	1
that	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
person	1
took	1
the	1
lead	1
because	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
was	1
transferred	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
replies	1
this	1
theory	1
gives	1
to	1
historical	1
questions	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
replies	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
watching	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
and	1
paying	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
varying	1
quality	1
of	1
the	1
pasturage	1
in	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
driving	1
of	1
the	1
herdsman,	1
should	1
attribute	1
the	1
direction	1
the	1
herd	1
takes	1
to	1
what	1
animal	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
its	1
head.	1
	1
"The	1
herd	1
goes	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
because	1
the	1
animal	1
in	1
front	1
leads	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
animals	1
is	1
vested	1
in	1
that	1
leader."	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
historians	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
say--those	1
who	1
assume	1
the	1
unconditional	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will.	1
	1
"If	1
the	1
animals	1
leading	1
the	1
herd	1
change,	1
this	1
happens	1
because	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
animals	1
is	1
transferred	1
from	1
one	1
leader	1
to	1
another,	1
according	1
to	1
whether	1
the	1
animal	1
is	1
or	1
is	1
not	1
leading	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
selected	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
herd."	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
reply	1
historians	1
who	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
delegated	1
to	1
rulers	1
under	1
conditions	1
which	1
they	1
regard	1
as	1
known.	1
(With	1
this	1
method	1
of	1
observation	1
it	1
often	1
happens	1
that	1
the	1
observer,	1
influenced	1
by	1
the	1
direction	1
he	1
himself	1
prefers,	1
regards	1
those	1
as	1
leaders	1
who,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
people's	1
change	1
of	1
direction,	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
front,	1
but	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
rear.)	1
	1
"If	1
the	1
animals	1
in	1
front	1
are	1
continually	1
changing	1
and	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
is	1
constantly	1
altered,	1
this	1
is	1
because	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
follow	1
a	1
given	1
direction	1
the	1
animals	1
transfer	1
their	1
will	1
to	1
the	1
animals	1
that	1
have	1
attracted	1
our	1
attention,	1
and	1
to	1
study	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
herd	1
we	1
must	1
watch	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
prominent	1
animals	1
moving	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
herd."	1
So	1
say	1
the	1
third	1
class	1
of	1
historians	1
who	1
regard	1
all	1
historical	1
persons,	1
from	1
monarchs	1
to	1
journalists,	1
as	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
their	1
age.	1
	1
The	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
historic	1
persons	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
paraphrase--a	1
restatement	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
in	1
other	1
words.	1
	1
What	1
causes	1
historical	1
events?	1
Power.	1
What	1
is	1
power?	1
Power	1
is	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
transferred	1
to	1
one	1
person.	1
Under	1
what	1
condition	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
delegated	1
to	1
one	1
person?	1
On	1
condition	1
that	1
that	1
person	1
expresses	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
people.	1
That	1
is,	1
power	1
is	1
power:	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
power	1
is	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
human	1
knowledge	1
were	1
confined	1
to	1
abstract	1
reasoning,	1
then	1
having	1
subjected	1
to	1
criticism	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
"power"	1
that	1
juridical	1
science	1
gives	1
us,	1
humanity	1
would	1
conclude	1
that	1
power	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
has	1
no	1
real	1
existence.	1
But	1
to	1
understand	1
phenomena	1
man	1
has,	1
besides	1
abstract	1
reasoning,	1
experience	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
verifies	1
his	1
reflections.	1
And	1
experience	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
power	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
word	1
but	1
an	1
actually	1
existing	1
phenomenon.	1
	1
Not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
no	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
collective	1
activity	1
of	1
men	1
can	1
do	1
without	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
power,	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
power	1
is	1
proved	1
both	1
by	1
history	1
and	1
by	1
observing	1
contemporary	1
events.	1
	1
Whenever	1
an	1
event	1
occurs	1
a	1
man	1
appears	1
or	1
men	1
appear,	1
by	1
whose	1
will	1
the	1
event	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
place.	1
Napoleon	1
III	1
issues	1
a	1
decree	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
go	1
to	1
Mexico.	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
and	1
Bismarck	1
issue	1
decrees	1
and	1
an	1
army	1
enters	1
Bohemia.	1
Napoleon	1
I	1
issues	1
a	1
decree	1
and	1
an	1
army	1
enters	1
Russia.	1
Alexander	1
I	1
gives	1
a	1
command	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
Bourbons.	1
Experience	1
shows	1
us	1
that	1
whatever	1
event	1
occurs	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
of	1
several	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
decreed	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
historians,	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
habit	1
of	1
acknowledging	1
divine	1
intervention	1
in	1
human	1
affairs,	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
someone	1
endowed	1
with	1
power,	1
but	1
that	1
supposition	1
is	1
not	1
confirmed	1
either	1
by	1
reason	1
or	1
by	1
experience.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
reflection	1
shows	1
that	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
will--	1
his	1
words--are	1
only	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
activity	1
expressed	1
in	1
an	1
event,	1
as	1
for	1
instance	1
in	1
a	1
war	1
or	1
a	1
revolution,	1
and	1
so	1
without	1
assuming	1
an	1
incomprehensible,	1
supernatural	1
force--a	1
miracle--one	1
cannot	1
admit	1
that	1
words	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
immediate	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
men.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
admitted	1
that	1
words	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
events,	1
history	1
shows	1
that	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
historical	1
personages	1
does	1
not	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
produce	1
any	1
effect,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
their	1
commands	1
are	1
often	1
not	1
executed,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
the	1
very	1
opposite	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
order	1
occurs.	1
	1
Without	1
admitting	1
divine	1
intervention	1
in	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
humanity	1
we	1
cannot	1
regard	1
"power"	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
events.	1
	1
Power,	1
from	1
the	1
standpoint	1
of	1
experience,	1
is	1
merely	1
the	1
relation	1
that	1
exists	1
between	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
someone's	1
will	1
and	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
that	1
will	1
by	1
others.	1
	1
To	1
explain	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
that	1
relationship	1
we	1
must	1
first	1
establish	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
will,	1
referring	1
it	1
to	1
man	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
Deity.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
Deity	1
issues	1
a	1
command,	1
expresses	1
His	1
will,	1
as	1
ancient	1
history	1
tells	1
us,	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
will	1
is	1
independent	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
caused	1
by	1
anything,	1
for	1
the	1
Divinity	1
is	1
not	1
controlled	1
by	1
an	1
event.	1
But	1
speaking	1
of	1
commands	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
men	1
acting	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
connection	1
of	1
commands	1
with	1
events	1
we	1
must	1
restore:	1
(1)	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
takes	1
place:	1
the	1
continuity	1
of	1
movement	1
in	1
time	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
commands,	1
and	1
(2)	1
the	1
inevitability	1
of	1
the	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
person	1
commanding	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
execute	1
his	1
command.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Only	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Deity,	1
not	1
dependent	1
on	1
time,	1
can	1
relate	1
to	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
events	1
occurring	1
over	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
years	1
or	1
centuries,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
Deity,	1
independent	1
of	1
everything,	1
can	1
by	1
His	1
sole	1
will	1
determine	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
humanity's	1
movement;	1
but	1
man	1
acts	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
himself	1
takes	1
part	1
in	1
what	1
occurs.	1
	1
Reinstating	1
the	1
first	1
condition	1
omitted,	1
that	1
of	1
time,	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
no	1
command	1
can	1
be	1
executed	1
without	1
some	1
preceding	1
order	1
having	1
been	1
given	1
rendering	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
command	1
possible.	1
	1
No	1
command	1
ever	1
appears	1
spontaneously,	1
or	1
itself	1
covers	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
occurrences;	1
but	1
each	1
command	1
follows	1
from	1
another,	1
and	1
never	1
refers	1
to	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
events	1
but	1
always	1
to	1
one	1
moment	1
only	1
of	1
an	1
event.	1
	1
When,	1
for	1
instance,	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
ordered	1
armies	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
war,	1
we	1
combine	1
in	1
one	1
simultaneous	1
expression	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
consecutive	1
commands	1
dependent	1
one	1
on	1
another.	1
Napoleon	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
commanded	1
an	1
invasion	1
of	1
Russia	1
and	1
never	1
did	1
so.	1
Today	1
he	1
ordered	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
papers	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
to	1
Vienna,	1
to	1
Berlin,	1
and	1
to	1
Petersburg;	1
tomorrow	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
decrees	1
and	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
the	1
fleet,	1
the	1
commissariat,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
and	1
so	1
on--millions	1
of	1
commands,	1
which	1
formed	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
corresponding	1
to	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
events	1
which	1
brought	1
the	1
French	1
armies	1
into	1
Russia.	1
	1
If	1
throughout	1
his	1
reign	1
Napoleon	1
gave	1
commands	1
concerning	1
an	1
invasion	1
of	1
England	1
and	1
expended	1
on	1
no	1
other	1
undertaking	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
and	1
effort,	1
and	1
yet	1
during	1
his	1
whole	1
reign	1
never	1
once	1
attempted	1
to	1
execute	1
that	1
design	1
but	1
undertook	1
an	1
expedition	1
into	1
Russia,	1
with	1
which	1
country	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
desirable	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
alliance	1
(a	1
conviction	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
expressed)--this	1
came	1
about	1
because	1
his	1
commands	1
did	1
not	1
correspond	1
to	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
case,	1
but	1
did	1
so	1
correspond	1
in	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
For	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
certainly	1
executed,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
order	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
executed.	1
But	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
can	1
and	1
what	1
cannot	1
be	1
executed	1
is	1
impossible,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
invasion	1
of	1
Russia	1
in	1
which	1
millions	1
participated,	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
simplest	1
event,	1
for	1
in	1
either	1
case	1
millions	1
of	1
obstacles	1
may	1
arise	1
to	1
prevent	1
its	1
execution.	1
Every	1
order	1
executed	1
is	1
always	1
one	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
unexecuted.	1
All	1
the	1
impossible	1
orders	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
remain	1
unexecuted.	1
Only	1
the	1
possible	1
ones	1
get	1
linked	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
consecutive	1
series	1
of	1
commands	1
corresponding	1
to	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
are	1
executed.	1
	1
Our	1
false	1
conception	1
that	1
an	1
event	1
is	1
caused	1
by	1
a	1
command	1
which	1
precedes	1
it	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
event	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
others	1
those	1
few	1
commands	1
which	1
were	1
consistent	1
with	1
that	1
event	1
have	1
been	1
executed,	1
we	1
forget	1
about	1
the	1
others	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
executed	1
because	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be.	1
Apart	1
from	1
that,	1
the	1
chief	1
source	1
of	1
our	1
error	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
historical	1
accounts	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
innumerable,	1
diverse,	1
and	1
petty	1
events,	1
such	1
for	1
instance	1
as	1
all	1
those	1
which	1
led	1
the	1
French	1
armies	1
to	1
Russia,	1
is	1
generalized	1
into	1
one	1
event	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
produced	1
by	1
that	1
series	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
corresponding	1
with	1
this	1
generalization	1
the	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
commands	1
is	1
also	1
generalized	1
into	1
a	1
single	1
expression	1
of	1
will.	1
	1
We	1
say	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
wished	1
to	1
invade	1
Russia	1
and	1
invaded	1
it.	1
In	1
reality	1
in	1
all	1
Napoleon's	1
activity	1
we	1
never	1
find	1
anything	1
resembling	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
wish,	1
but	1
find	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
orders,	1
or	1
expressions	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
very	1
variously	1
and	1
indefinitely	1
directed.	1
Amid	1
a	1
long	1
series	1
of	1
unexecuted	1
orders	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
one	1
series,	1
for	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812,	1
was	1
carried	1
out--not	1
because	1
those	1
orders	1
differed	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
unexecuted	1
orders	1
but	1
because	1
they	1
coincided	1
with	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
that	1
led	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
into	1
Russia;	1
just	1
as	1
in	1
stencil	1
work	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
figure	1
comes	1
out	1
not	1
because	1
the	1
color	1
was	1
laid	1
on	1
from	1
this	1
side	1
or	1
in	1
that	1
way,	1
but	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
laid	1
on	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
over	1
the	1
figure	1
cut	1
in	1
the	1
stencil.	1
	1
So	1
that	1
examining	1
the	1
relation	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
commands	1
to	1
the	1
events,	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
a	1
command	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
event,	1
but	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
definite	1
dependence	1
exists	1
between	1
the	1
two.	1
	1
To	1
understand	1
in	1
what	1
this	1
dependence	1
consists	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
reinstate	1
another	1
omitted	1
condition	1
of	1
every	1
command	1
proceeding	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
Deity	1
but	1
from	1
a	1
man,	1
which	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
gives	1
the	1
command	1
himself	1
takes	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
This	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
commander	1
to	1
those	1
he	1
commands	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
power.	1
This	1
relation	1
consists	1
in	1
the	1
following:	1
	1
For	1
common	1
action	1
people	1
always	1
unite	1
in	1
certain	1
combinations,	1
in	1
which	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
the	1
aims	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
action,	1
the	1
relation	1
between	1
those	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
Men	1
uniting	1
in	1
these	1
combinations	1
always	1
assume	1
such	1
relations	1
toward	1
one	1
another	1
that	1
the	1
larger	1
number	1
take	1
a	1
more	1
direct	1
share,	1
and	1
the	1
smaller	1
number	1
a	1
less	1
direct	1
share,	1
in	1
the	1
collective	1
action	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
combined.	1
	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
combinations	1
in	1
which	1
men	1
unite	1
for	1
collective	1
action	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
striking	1
and	1
definite	1
examples	1
is	1
an	1
army.	1
	1
Every	1
army	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
lower	1
grades	1
of	1
the	1
service--the	1
rank	1
and	1
file--of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
the	1
greatest	1
number;	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
higher	1
military	1
rank--corporals	1
and	1
noncommissioned	1
officers	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
fewer,	1
and	1
of	1
still-higher	1
officers	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
still	1
fewer,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
military	1
command	1
which	1
is	1
concentrated	1
in	1
one	1
person.	1
	1
A	1
military	1
organization	1
may	1
be	1
quite	1
correctly	1
compared	1
to	1
a	1
cone,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
base	1
with	1
the	1
largest	1
diameter	1
consists	1
of	1
the	1
rank	1
and	1
file;	1
the	1
next	1
higher	1
and	1
smaller	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
cone	1
consists	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
higher	1
grades	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
apex,	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
which	1
will	1
represent	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
most,	1
form	1
the	1
lower	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
cone	1
and	1
its	1
base.	1
The	1
soldier	1
himself	1
does	1
the	1
stabbing,	1
hacking,	1
burning,	1
and	1
pillaging,	1
and	1
always	1
receives	1
orders	1
for	1
these	1
actions	1
from	1
men	1
above	1
him;	1
he	1
himself	1
never	1
gives	1
an	1
order.	1
The	1
noncommissioned	1
officers	1
(of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
fewer)	1
perform	1
the	1
action	1
itself	1
less	1
frequently	1
than	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
but	1
they	1
already	1
give	1
commands.	1
An	1
officer	1
still	1
less	1
often	1
acts	1
directly	1
himself,	1
but	1
commands	1
still	1
more	1
frequently.	1
A	1
general	1
does	1
nothing	1
but	1
command	1
the	1
troops,	1
indicates	1
the	1
objective,	1
and	1
hardly	1
ever	1
uses	1
a	1
weapon	1
himself.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
never	1
takes	1
direct	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
itself,	1
but	1
only	1
gives	1
general	1
orders	1
concerning	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
troops.	1
A	1
similar	1
relation	1
of	1
people	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
every	1
combination	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
common	1
activity--in	1
agriculture,	1
trade,	1
and	1
every	1
administration.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
without	1
particularly	1
analyzing	1
all	1
the	1
contiguous	1
sections	1
of	1
a	1
cone	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
an	1
army,	1
or	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
positions	1
in	1
any	1
administrative	1
or	1
public	1
business	1
whatever	1
from	1
the	1
lowest	1
to	1
the	1
highest,	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
law	1
by	1
which	1
men,	1
to	1
take	1
associated	1
action,	1
combine	1
in	1
such	1
relations	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
directly	1
they	1
participate	1
in	1
performing	1
the	1
action	1
the	1
less	1
they	1
can	1
command	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
numerous	1
they	1
are,	1
while	1
the	1
less	1
their	1
direct	1
participation	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
itself,	1
the	1
more	1
they	1
command	1
and	1
the	1
fewer	1
of	1
them	1
there	1
are;	1
rising	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
lowest	1
ranks	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
top,	1
who	1
takes	1
the	1
least	1
direct	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
directs	1
his	1
activity	1
chiefly	1
to	1
commanding.	1
	1
This	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
command	1
to	1
those	1
they	1
command	1
is	1
what	1
constitutes	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
conception	1
called	1
power.	1
	1
Having	1
restored	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
time	1
under	1
which	1
all	1
events	1
occur,	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
a	1
command	1
is	1
executed	1
only	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
related	1
to	1
a	1
corresponding	1
series	1
of	1
events.	1
Restoring	1
the	1
essential	1
condition	1
of	1
relation	1
between	1
those	1
who	1
command	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
execute,	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
those	1
who	1
command	1
take	1
the	1
smallest	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
itself	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
activity	1
is	1
exclusively	1
directed	1
to	1
commanding.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
When	1
an	1
event	1
is	1
taking	1
place	1
people	1
express	1
their	1
opinions	1
and	1
wishes	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
event	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
collective	1
activity	1
of	1
many	1
people,	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
opinions	1
or	1
wishes	1
expressed	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
if	1
but	1
approximately.	1
When	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
opinions	1
expressed	1
is	1
fulfilled,	1
that	1
opinion	1
gets	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
event	1
as	1
a	1
command	1
preceding	1
it.	1
	1
Men	1
are	1
hauling	1
a	1
log.	1
Each	1
of	1
them	1
expresses	1
his	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
and	1
where	1
to	1
haul	1
it.	1
They	1
haul	1
the	1
log	1
away,	1
and	1
it	1
happens	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
done	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
said.	1
He	1
ordered	1
it.	1
There	1
we	1
have	1
command	1
and	1
power	1
in	1
their	1
primary	1
form.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
worked	1
most	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
so	1
much	1
about	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing,	1
or	1
reflect	1
on	1
or	1
command	1
what	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
common	1
activity;	1
while	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
commanded	1
more	1
would	1
evidently	1
work	1
less	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
greater	1
verbal	1
activity.	1
	1
When	1
some	1
larger	1
concourse	1
of	1
men	1
direct	1
their	1
activity	1
to	1
a	1
common	1
aim	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
yet	1
sharper	1
division	1
of	1
those	1
who,	1
because	1
their	1
activity	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
directing	1
and	1
commanding,	1
take	1
less	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
direct	1
work.	1
	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
works	1
alone	1
he	1
always	1
has	1
a	1
certain	1
set	1
of	1
reflections	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
him	1
directed	1
his	1
past	1
activity,	1
justify	1
his	1
present	1
activity,	1
and	1
guide	1
him	1
in	1
planning	1
his	1
future	1
actions.	1
Just	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
concourse	1
of	1
people,	1
allowing	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
direct	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
activity	1
to	1
devise	1
considerations,	1
justifications,	1
and	1
surmises	1
concerning	1
their	1
collective	1
activity.	1
	1
For	1
reasons	1
known	1
or	1
unknown	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
French	1
began	1
to	1
drown	1
and	1
kill	1
one	1
another.	1
And	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
event	1
its	1
justification	1
appears	1
in	1
people's	1
belief	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
France,	1
for	1
liberty,	1
and	1
for	1
equality.	1
People	1
ceased	1
to	1
kill	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
this	1
event	1
was	1
accompanied	1
by	1
its	1
justification	1
in	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
a	1
centralization	1
of	1
power,	1
resistance	1
to	1
Europe,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Men	1
went	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
killing	1
their	1
fellow	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
event	1
was	1
accompanied	1
by	1
phrases	1
about	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
France,	1
the	1
baseness	1
of	1
England,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
History	1
shows	1
us	1
that	1
these	1
justifications	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
have	1
no	1
common	1
sense	1
and	1
are	1
all	1
contradictory,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
killing	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
recognizing	1
his	1
rights,	1
and	1
the	1
killing	1
of	1
millions	1
in	1
Russia	1
for	1
the	1
humiliation	1
of	1
England.	1
But	1
these	1
justifications	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
necessary	1
significance	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
day.	1
	1
These	1
justifications	1
release	1
those	1
who	1
produce	1
the	1
events	1
from	1
moral	1
responsibility.	1
These	1
temporary	1
aims	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
broom	1
fixed	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
locomotive	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
snow	1
from	1
the	1
rails	1
in	1
front:	1
they	1
clear	1
men's	1
moral	1
responsibilities	1
from	1
their	1
path.	1
	1
Without	1
such	1
justification	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
simplest	1
question	1
that	1
presents	1
itself	1
when	1
examining	1
each	1
historical	1
event.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
commit	1
collective	1
crimes--make	1
war,	1
commit	1
murder,	1
and	1
so	1
on?	1
	1
With	1
the	1
present	1
complex	1
forms	1
of	1
political	1
and	1
social	1
life	1
in	1
Europe	1
can	1
any	1
event	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
prescribed,	1
decreed,	1
or	1
ordered	1
by	1
monarchs,	1
ministers,	1
parliaments,	1
or	1
newspapers	1
be	1
imagined?	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
collective	1
action	1
which	1
cannot	1
find	1
its	1
justification	1
in	1
political	1
unity,	1
in	1
patriotism,	1
in	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power,	1
or	1
in	1
civilization?	1
So	1
that	1
every	1
event	1
that	1
occurs	1
inevitably	1
coincides	1
with	1
some	1
expressed	1
wish	1
and,	1
receiving	1
a	1
justification,	1
presents	1
itself	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
or	1
of	1
several	1
men.	1
	1
In	1
whatever	1
direction	1
a	1
ship	1
moves,	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
it	1
cuts	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
noticeable	1
ahead	1
of	1
it.	1
To	1
those	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
ship	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
those	1
waves	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
perceptible	1
motion.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
watching	1
closely	1
moment	1
by	1
moment	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
that	1
flow	1
and	1
comparing	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
do	1
we	1
convince	1
ourselves	1
that	1
every	1
bit	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
forward	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
led	1
into	1
error	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
we	1
ourselves	1
were	1
imperceptibly	1
moving.	1
	1
We	1
see	1
the	1
same	1
if	1
we	1
watch	1
moment	1
by	1
moment	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
historical	1
characters	1
(that	1
is,	1
re-establish	1
the	1
inevitable	1
condition	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
occurs--the	1
continuity	1
of	1
movement	1
in	1
time)	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
essential	1
connection	1
of	1
historical	1
persons	1
with	1
the	1
masses.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
ship	1
moves	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
wave	1
ahead	1
of	1
it,	1
when	1
it	1
turns	1
frequently	1
the	1
wave	1
ahead	1
of	1
it	1
also	1
turns	1
frequently.	1
But	1
wherever	1
it	1
may	1
turn	1
there	1
always	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
wave	1
anticipating	1
its	1
movement.	1
	1
Whatever	1
happens	1
it	1
always	1
appears	1
that	1
just	1
that	1
event	1
was	1
foreseen	1
and	1
decreed.	1
Wherever	1
the	1
ship	1
may	1
go,	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
water	1
which	1
neither	1
directs	1
nor	1
increases	1
its	1
movement	1
foams	1
ahead	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
move	1
of	1
itself	1
but	1
to	1
govern	1
the	1
ship's	1
movement	1
also.	1
	1
Examining	1
only	1
those	1
expressions	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
historical	1
persons	1
which,	1
as	1
commands,	1
were	1
related	1
to	1
events,	1
historians	1
have	1
assumed	1
that	1
the	1
events	1
depended	1
on	1
those	1
commands.	1
But	1
examining	1
the	1
events	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
connection	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
historical	1
persons	1
stood	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
orders	1
were	1
dependent	1
on	1
events.	1
The	1
incontestable	1
proof	1
of	1
this	1
deduction	1
is	1
that,	1
however	1
many	1
commands	1
were	1
issued,	1
the	1
event	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
place	1
unless	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
causes	1
for	1
it,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
an	1
event	1
occurs--be	1
it	1
what	1
it	1
may--	1
then	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
continually	1
expressed	1
wishes	1
of	1
different	1
people	1
some	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
found	1
which	1
by	1
their	1
meaning	1
and	1
their	1
time	1
of	1
utterance	1
are	1
related	1
as	1
commands	1
to	1
the	1
events.	1
	1
Arriving	1
at	1
this	1
conclusion	1
we	1
can	1
reply	1
directly	1
and	1
positively	1
to	1
these	1
two	1
essential	1
questions	1
of	1
history:	1
	1
(1)	1
What	1
is	1
power?	1
	1
(2)	1
What	1
force	1
produces	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
nations?	1
	1
(1)	1
Power	1
is	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
a	1
given	1
person	1
to	1
other	1
individuals,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
more	1
this	1
person	1
expresses	1
opinions,	1
predictions,	1
and	1
justifications	1
of	1
the	1
collective	1
action	1
that	1
is	1
performed,	1
the	1
less	1
is	1
his	1
participation	1
in	1
that	1
action.	1
	1
(2)	1
The	1
movement	1
of	1
nations	1
is	1
caused	1
not	1
by	1
power,	1
nor	1
by	1
intellectual	1
activity,	1
nor	1
even	1
by	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
as	1
historians	1
have	1
supposed,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
participate	1
in	1
the	1
events,	1
and	1
who	1
always	1
combine	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
those	1
taking	1
the	1
largest	1
direct	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
take	1
on	1
themselves	1
the	1
least	1
responsibility	1
and	1
vice	1
versa.	1
	1
Morally	1
the	1
wielder	1
of	1
power	1
appears	1
to	1
cause	1
the	1
event;	1
physically	1
it	1
is	1
those	1
who	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
power.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
moral	1
activity	1
is	1
inconceivable	1
without	1
the	1
physical,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
is	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
the	1
two.	1
	1
Or	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
cause	1
is	1
inapplicable	1
to	1
the	1
phenomena	1
we	1
are	1
examining.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
analysis	1
we	1
reach	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
infinity--that	1
final	1
limit	1
to	1
which	1
in	1
every	1
domain	1
of	1
thought	1
man's	1
reason	1
arrives	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
subject.	1
Electricity	1
produces	1
heat,	1
heat	1
produces	1
electricity.	1
Atoms	1
attract	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
atoms	1
repel	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Speaking	1
of	1
the	1
interaction	1
of	1
heat	1
and	1
electricity	1
and	1
of	1
atoms,	1
we	1
cannot	1
say	1
why	1
this	1
occurs,	1
and	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
inconceivable	1
otherwise,	1
because	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
law.	1
The	1
same	1
applies	1
to	1
historical	1
events.	1
Why	1
war	1
and	1
revolution	1
occur	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know.	1
We	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
action,	1
people	1
combine	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
formation	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
all	1
take	1
part,	1
and	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
so	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
unthinkable	1
otherwise,	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
law.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
If	1
history	1
dealt	1
only	1
with	1
external	1
phenomena,	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
this	1
simple	1
and	1
obvious	1
law	1
would	1
suffice	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
finished	1
our	1
argument.	1
But	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
history	1
relates	1
to	1
man.	1
A	1
particle	1
of	1
matter	1
cannot	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
attraction	1
or	1
repulsion	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
law	1
is	1
untrue,	1
but	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
history,	1
says	1
plainly:	1
I	1
am	1
free	1
and	1
am	1
therefore	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will,	1
though	1
unexpressed,	1
is	1
felt	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
All	1
seriously	1
thinking	1
historians	1
have	1
involuntarily	1
encountered	1
this	1
question.	1
All	1
the	1
contradictions	1
and	1
obscurities	1
of	1
history	1
and	1
the	1
false	1
path	1
historical	1
science	1
has	1
followed	1
are	1
due	1
solely	1
to	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
that	1
question.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
were	1
free,	1
that	1
is,	1
if	1
each	1
man	1
could	1
act	1
as	1
he	1
pleased,	1
all	1
history	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
disconnected	1
incidents.	1
	1
If	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
even	1
one	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
million	1
could	1
act	1
freely,	1
that	1
is,	1
as	1
he	1
chose,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
one	1
single	1
free	1
act	1
of	1
that	1
man's	1
in	1
violation	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
governing	1
human	1
action	1
would	1
destroy	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
any	1
laws	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
humanity.	1
	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
single	1
law	1
governing	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
men,	1
free	1
will	1
cannot	1
exist,	1
for	1
then	1
man's	1
will	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
that	1
law.	1
	1
In	1
this	1
contradiction	1
lies	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
free	1
will,	1
which	1
from	1
most	1
ancient	1
times	1
has	1
occupied	1
the	1
best	1
human	1
minds	1
and	1
from	1
most	1
ancient	1
times	1
has	1
been	1
presented	1
in	1
its	1
whole	1
tremendous	1
significance.	1
	1
The	1
problem	1
is	1
that	1
regarding	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
observation	1
from	1
whatever	1
point	1
of	1
view--theological,	1
historical,	1
ethical,	1
or	1
philosophic--we	1
find	1
a	1
general	1
law	1
of	1
necessity	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
(like	1
all	1
that	1
exists)	1
is	1
subject.	1
But	1
regarding	1
him	1
from	1
within	1
ourselves	1
as	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
conscious	1
of,	1
we	1
feel	1
ourselves	1
to	1
be	1
free.	1
	1
This	1
consciousness	1
is	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
self-cognition	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
and	1
independent	1
of	1
reason.	1
Through	1
his	1
reason	1
man	1
observes	1
himself,	1
but	1
only	1
through	1
consciousness	1
does	1
he	1
know	1
himself.	1
	1
Apart	1
from	1
consciousness	1
of	1
self	1
no	1
observation	1
or	1
application	1
of	1
reason	1
is	1
conceivable.	1
	1
To	1
understand,	1
observe,	1
and	1
draw	1
conclusions,	1
man	1
must	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
be	1
conscious	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
living.	1
A	1
man	1
is	1
only	1
conscious	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
living	1
being	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
wills,	1
that	1
is,	1
is	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
volition.	1
But	1
his	1
will--which	1
forms	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
his	1
life--man	1
recognizes	1
(and	1
can	1
but	1
recognize)	1
as	1
free.	1
	1
If,	1
observing	1
himself,	1
man	1
sees	1
that	1
his	1
will	1
is	1
always	1
directed	1
by	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
law	1
(whether	1
he	1
observes	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
taking	1
food,	1
using	1
his	1
brain,	1
or	1
anything	1
else)	1
he	1
cannot	1
recognize	1
this	1
never-	1
varying	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
will	1
otherwise	1
than	1
as	1
a	1
limitation	1
of	1
it.	1
Were	1
it	1
not	1
free	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
limited.	1
A	1
man's	1
will	1
seems	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
limited	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
conscious	1
of	1
it	1
except	1
as	1
free.	1
	1
You	1
say:	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
free.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
lifted	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
fall.	1
Everyone	1
understands	1
that	1
this	1
illogical	1
reply	1
is	1
an	1
irrefutable	1
demonstration	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
That	1
reply	1
is	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
consciousness	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
reason.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
separate	1
and	1
independent	1
source	1
of	1
self-consciousness	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
reasoning	1
and	1
to	1
experience,	1
but	1
in	1
fact	1
such	1
subjection	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
and	1
is	1
inconceivable.	1
	1
A	1
series	1
of	1
experiments	1
and	1
arguments	1
proves	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
he,	1
as	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
observation,	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
certain	1
laws,	1
and	1
man	1
submits	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
never	1
resists	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
gravity	1
or	1
impermeability	1
once	1
he	1
has	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
series	1
of	1
experiments	1
and	1
arguments	1
proves	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
complete	1
freedom	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
conscious	1
in	1
himself	1
is	1
impossible,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
every	1
action	1
depends	1
on	1
his	1
organization,	1
his	1
character,	1
and	1
the	1
motives	1
acting	1
upon	1
him;	1
yet	1
man	1
never	1
submits	1
to	1
the	1
deductions	1
of	1
these	1
experiments	1
and	1
arguments.	1
Having	1
learned	1
from	1
experiment	1
and	1
argument	1
that	1
a	1
stone	1
falls	1
downwards,	1
a	1
man	1
indubitably	1
believes	1
this	1
and	1
always	1
expects	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
learned	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
But	1
learning	1
just	1
as	1
certainly	1
that	1
his	1
will	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
laws,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
believe	1
this.	1
	1
However	1
often	1
experiment	1
and	1
reasoning	1
may	1
show	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
conditions	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
character	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
before,	1
yet	1
when	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
conditions	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
character	1
he	1
approaches	1
for	1
the	1
thousandth	1
time	1
the	1
action	1
that	1
always	1
ends	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
he	1
feels	1
as	1
certainly	1
convinced	1
as	1
before	1
the	1
experiment	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
act	1
as	1
he	1
pleases.	1
Every	1
man,	1
savage	1
or	1
sage,	1
however	1
incontestably	1
reason	1
and	1
experiment	1
may	1
prove	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
two	1
different	1
courses	1
of	1
action	1
in	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
conditions,	1
feels	1
that	1
without	1
this	1
irrational	1
conception	1
(which	1
constitutes	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
freedom)	1
he	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
life.	1
He	1
feels	1
that	1
however	1
impossible	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
it	1
is	1
so,	1
for	1
without	1
this	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
not	1
only	1
would	1
he	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
life,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
moment.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
live,	1
because	1
all	1
man's	1
efforts,	1
all	1
his	1
impulses	1
to	1
life,	1
are	1
only	1
efforts	1
to	1
increase	1
freedom.	1
Wealth	1
and	1
poverty,	1
fame	1
and	1
obscurity,	1
power	1
and	1
subordination,	1
strength	1
and	1
weakness,	1
health	1
and	1
disease,	1
culture	1
and	1
ignorance,	1
work	1
and	1
leisure,	1
repletion	1
and	1
hunger,	1
virtue	1
and	1
vice,	1
are	1
only	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
degrees	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
A	1
man	1
having	1
no	1
freedom	1
cannot	1
be	1
conceived	1
of	1
except	1
as	1
deprived	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
appears	1
to	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
senseless	1
contradiction	1
like	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
performing	1
two	1
actions	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
of	1
time,	1
or	1
of	1
an	1
effect	1
without	1
a	1
cause,	1
that	1
only	1
proves	1
that	1
consciousness	1
is	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
reason.	1
	1
This	1
unshakable,	1
irrefutable	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom,	1
uncontrolled	1
by	1
experiment	1
or	1
argument,	1
recognized	1
by	1
all	1
thinkers	1
and	1
felt	1
by	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception,	1
this	1
consciousness	1
without	1
which	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
possible	1
constitutes	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
	1
Man	1
is	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
an	1
all-powerful,	1
all-good,	1
and	1
all-seeing	1
God.	1
What	1
is	1
sin,	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
which	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
man's	1
freedom?	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
theology.	1
	1
The	1
actions	1
of	1
men	1
are	1
subject	1
to	1
general	1
immutable	1
laws	1
expressed	1
in	1
statistics.	1
What	1
is	1
man's	1
responsibility	1
to	1
society,	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
which	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom?	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
jurisprudence.	1
	1
Man's	1
actions	1
proceed	1
from	1
his	1
innate	1
character	1
and	1
the	1
motives	1
acting	1
upon	1
him.	1
What	1
is	1
conscience	1
and	1
the	1
perception	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong	1
in	1
actions	1
that	1
follows	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom?	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
ethics.	1
	1
Man	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
life	1
of	1
humanity	1
appears	1
subject	1
to	1
laws	1
which	1
determine	1
that	1
life.	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
apart	1
from	1
that	1
connection	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
free.	1
How	1
should	1
the	1
past	1
life	1
of	1
nations	1
and	1
of	1
humanity	1
be	1
regarded--as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
free,	1
or	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
constrained,	1
activity	1
of	1
man?	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
history.	1
	1
Only	1
in	1
our	1
self-confident	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
popularization	1
of	1
knowledge--	1
thanks	1
to	1
that	1
most	1
powerful	1
engine	1
of	1
ignorance,	1
the	1
diffusion	1
of	1
printed	1
matter--has	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
will	1
been	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
question	1
itself	1
cannot	1
exist.	1
In	1
our	1
time	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
so-called	1
advanced	1
people--that	1
is,	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
ignoramuses--have	1
taken	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
naturalists	1
who	1
deal	1
with	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
problem.	1
	1
They	1
say	1
and	1
write	1
and	1
print	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
freedom	1
do	1
not	1
exist,	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
expressed	1
by	1
muscular	1
movements	1
and	1
muscular	1
movements	1
are	1
conditioned	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
nerves;	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
free	1
will	1
do	1
not	1
exist	1
because	1
at	1
an	1
unknown	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
we	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
apes.	1
They	1
say	1
this,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
suspecting	1
that	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
ago	1
that	1
same	1
law	1
of	1
necessity	1
which	1
with	1
such	1
ardor	1
they	1
are	1
now	1
trying	1
to	1
prove	1
by	1
physiology	1
and	1
comparative	1
zoology	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
acknowledged	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
religions	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
thinkers,	1
but	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
denied.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
sciences	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
is	1
merely	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
an	1
instrument	1
for	1
the	1
illumination	1
of	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
it.	1
For	1
the	1
fact	1
that,	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
observation,	1
reason	1
and	1
the	1
will	1
are	1
merely	1
secretions	1
of	1
the	1
brain,	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
following	1
the	1
general	1
law	1
may	1
have	1
developed	1
from	1
lower	1
animals	1
at	1
some	1
unknown	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
only	1
explains	1
from	1
a	1
fresh	1
side	1
the	1
truth	1
admitted	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
ago	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
religious	1
and	1
philosophic	1
theories--that	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
reason	1
man	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
necessity;	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
advance	1
by	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
which	1
has	1
another,	1
opposite,	1
side,	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
If	1
men	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
apes	1
at	1
an	1
unknown	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
that	1
is	1
as	1
comprehensible	1
as	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
from	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
earth	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
(in	1
the	1
first	1
case	1
the	1
unknown	1
quantity	1
is	1
the	1
time,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
origin);	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
man's	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
reconciled	1
with	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
necessity	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
subject	1
cannot	1
be	1
solved	1
by	1
comparative	1
physiology	1
and	1
zoology,	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
frog,	1
a	1
rabbit,	1
or	1
an	1
ape,	1
we	1
can	1
observe	1
only	1
the	1
muscular	1
nervous	1
activity,	1
but	1
in	1
man	1
we	1
observe	1
consciousness	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
muscular	1
and	1
nervous	1
activity.	1
	1
The	1
naturalists	1
and	1
their	1
followers,	1
thinking	1
they	1
can	1
solve	1
this	1
question,	1
are	1
like	1
plasterers	1
set	1
to	1
plaster	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
a	1
church	1
who,	1
availing	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
superintendent	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
should	1
in	1
an	1
access	1
of	1
zeal	1
plaster	1
over	1
the	1
windows,	1
icons,	1
woodwork,	1
and	1
still	1
unbuttressed	1
walls,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
delighted	1
that	1
from	1
their	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
as	1
plasterers,	1
everything	1
is	1
now	1
so	1
smooth	1
and	1
regular.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
For	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
or	1
inevitability,	1
history	1
has	1
this	1
advantage	1
over	1
other	1
branches	1
of	1
knowledge	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
dealt	1
with,	1
that	1
for	1
history	1
this	1
question	1
does	1
not	1
refer	1
to	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
but	1
its	1
manifestation	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
under	1
certain	1
conditions.	1
	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
question,	1
history	1
stands	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
sciences	1
as	1
experimental	1
science	1
stands	1
to	1
abstract	1
science.	1
	1
The	1
subject	1
for	1
history	1
is	1
not	1
man's	1
will	1
itself	1
but	1
our	1
presentation	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
for	1
history,	1
the	1
insoluble	1
mystery	1
presented	1
by	1
the	1
incompatibility	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
and	1
inevitability	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
as	1
it	1
does	1
for	1
theology,	1
ethics,	1
and	1
philosophy.	1
History	1
surveys	1
a	1
presentation	1
of	1
man's	1
life	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
contradictions	1
has	1
already	1
taken	1
place.	1
	1
In	1
actual	1
life	1
each	1
historic	1
event,	1
each	1
human	1
action,	1
is	1
very	1
clearly	1
and	1
definitely	1
understood	1
without	1
any	1
sense	1
of	1
contradiction,	1
although	1
each	1
event	1
presents	1
itself	1
as	1
partly	1
free	1
and	1
partly	1
compulsory.	1
	1
To	1
solve	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
freedom	1
and	1
necessity	1
are	1
combined	1
and	1
what	1
constitutes	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
conceptions,	1
the	1
philosophy	1
of	1
history	1
can	1
and	1
should	1
follow	1
a	1
path	1
contrary	1
to	1
that	1
taken	1
by	1
other	1
sciences.	1
Instead	1
of	1
first	1
defining	1
the	1
conceptions	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability	1
in	1
themselves,	1
and	1
then	1
ranging	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
life	1
under	1
those	1
definitions,	1
history	1
should	1
deduce	1
a	1
definition	1
of	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
immense	1
quantity	1
of	1
phenomena	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
cognizant	1
and	1
that	1
always	1
appear	1
dependent	1
on	1
these	1
two	1
elements.	1
	1
Whatever	1
presentation	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
many	1
men	1
or	1
of	1
an	1
individual	1
we	1
may	1
consider,	1
we	1
always	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
partly	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
and	1
partly	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
	1
Whether	1
we	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
migration	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
and	1
the	1
incursions	1
of	1
the	1
barbarians,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
III,	1
or	1
of	1
someone's	1
action	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
in	1
choosing	1
one	1
direction	1
out	1
of	1
several	1
for	1
his	1
walk,	1
we	1
are	1
unconscious	1
of	1
any	1
contradiction.	1
The	1
degree	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability	1
governing	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
is	1
clearly	1
defined	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
Our	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
freedom	1
often	1
varies	1
according	1
to	1
differences	1
in	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
regard	1
the	1
event,	1
but	1
every	1
human	1
action	1
appears	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
a	1
certain	1
combination	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability.	1
In	1
every	1
action	1
we	1
examine	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
certain	1
measure	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
measure	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
And	1
always	1
the	1
more	1
freedom	1
we	1
see	1
in	1
any	1
action	1
the	1
less	1
inevitability	1
do	1
we	1
perceive,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
inevitability	1
the	1
less	1
freedom.	1
	1
The	1
proportion	1
of	1
freedom	1
to	1
inevitability	1
decreases	1
and	1
increases	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
action	1
is	1
regarded,	1
but	1
their	1
relation	1
is	1
always	1
one	1
of	1
inverse	1
proportion.	1
	1
A	1
sinking	1
man	1
who	1
clutches	1
at	1
another	1
and	1
drowns	1
him;	1
or	1
a	1
hungry	1
mother	1
exhausted	1
by	1
feeding	1
her	1
baby,	1
who	1
steals	1
some	1
food;	1
or	1
a	1
man	1
trained	1
to	1
discipline	1
who	1
on	1
duty	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
kills	1
a	1
defenseless	1
man--	1
seem	1
less	1
guilty,	1
that	1
is,	1
less	1
free	1
and	1
more	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
necessity,	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
knows	1
the	1
circumstances	1
in	1
which	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
placed,	1
and	1
more	1
free	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
himself	1
drowning,	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
was	1
hungry,	1
that	1
the	1
soldier	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ranks,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Similarly	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
committed	1
a	1
murder	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
and	1
has	1
since	1
lived	1
peaceably	1
and	1
harmlessly	1
in	1
society	1
seems	1
less	1
guilty	1
and	1
his	1
action	1
more	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
considers	1
his	1
action	1
after	1
twenty	1
years	1
have	1
elapsed	1
than	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
examined	1
it	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
committed.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
every	1
action	1
of	1
an	1
insane,	1
intoxicated,	1
or	1
highly	1
excited	1
man	1
appears	1
less	1
free	1
and	1
more	1
inevitable	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
knows	1
the	1
mental	1
condition	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
committed	1
the	1
action,	1
and	1
seems	1
more	1
free	1
and	1
less	1
inevitable	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
it.	1
In	1
all	1
these	1
cases	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
is	1
increased	1
or	1
diminished	1
and	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
compulsion	1
is	1
correspondingly	1
decreased	1
or	1
increased,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
action	1
is	1
regarded.	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
necessity	1
the	1
smaller	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
vice	1
versa.	1
	1
Religion,	1
the	1
common	1
sense	1
of	1
mankind,	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
jurisprudence,	1
and	1
history	1
itself	1
understand	1
alike	1
this	1
relation	1
between	1
necessity	1
and	1
freedom.	1
	1
All	1
cases	1
without	1
exception	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
necessity	1
is	1
increased	1
and	1
diminished	1
depend	1
on	1
three	1
considerations:	1
	1
(1)	1
The	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
commits	1
the	1
deeds.	1
	1
(2)	1
His	1
relation	1
to	1
time.	1
	1
(3)	1
His	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
causes	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
action.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
consideration	1
is	1
the	1
clearness	1
of	1
our	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
man's	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
clearness	1
of	1
our	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
definite	1
position	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
everything	1
coexisting	1
with	1
him.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
makes	1
it	1
evident	1
that	1
a	1
drowning	1
man	1
is	1
less	1
free	1
and	1
more	1
subject	1
to	1
necessity	1
than	1
one	1
standing	1
on	1
dry	1
ground,	1
and	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
closely	1
connected	1
with	1
others	1
in	1
a	1
thickly	1
populated	1
district,	1
or	1
of	1
one	1
bound	1
by	1
family,	1
official,	1
or	1
business	1
duties,	1
seem	1
certainly	1
less	1
free	1
and	1
more	1
subject	1
to	1
necessity	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
living	1
in	1
solitude	1
and	1
seclusion.	1
	1
If	1
we	1
consider	1
a	1
man	1
alone,	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
everything	1
around	1
him,	1
each	1
action	1
of	1
his	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
free.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
see	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
anything	1
around	1
him,	1
if	1
we	1
see	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
anything	1
whatever--	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
speaks	1
to	1
him,	1
a	1
book	1
he	1
reads,	1
the	1
work	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
engaged,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
he	1
breathes	1
or	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
falls	1
on	1
the	1
things	1
about	1
him--we	1
see	1
that	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
circumstances	1
has	1
an	1
influence	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
controls	1
at	1
least	1
some	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
activity.	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
we	1
perceive	1
of	1
these	1
influences	1
the	1
more	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
his	1
freedom	1
diminishes	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
that	1
weighs	1
on	1
him	1
increases.	1
	1
The	1
second	1
consideration	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
evident	1
time	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
clearness	1
of	1
our	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
the	1
man's	1
action	1
occupies	1
in	1
time.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
ground	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
man,	1
resulting	1
in	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race,	1
appear	1
evidently	1
less	1
free	1
than	1
a	1
man's	1
entry	1
into	1
marriage	1
today.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
activity	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
lived	1
centuries	1
ago	1
and	1
are	1
connected	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
time	1
cannot	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
free	1
as	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
contemporary,	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
still	1
unknown	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
The	1
degree	1
of	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
or	1
inevitability	1
depends	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
on	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
lapse	1
of	1
time	1
between	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
our	1
judgment	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
If	1
I	1
examine	1
an	1
act	1
I	1
performed	1
a	1
moment	1
ago	1
in	1
approximately	1
the	1
same	1
circumstances	1
as	1
those	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
now,	1
my	1
action	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
undoubtedly	1
free.	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
examine	1
an	1
act	1
performed	1
a	1
month	1
ago,	1
then	1
being	1
in	1
different	1
circumstances,	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
recognizing	1
that	1
if	1
that	1
act	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
committed	1
much	1
that	1
resulted	1
from	1
it--good,	1
agreeable,	1
and	1
even	1
essential--would	1
not	1
have	1
taken	1
place.	1
If	1
I	1
reflect	1
on	1
an	1
action	1
still	1
more	1
remote,	1
ten	1
years	1
ago	1
or	1
more,	1
then	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
my	1
action	1
are	1
still	1
plainer	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
find	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
imagine	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
that	1
action	1
not	1
been	1
performed.	1
The	1
farther	1
I	1
go	1
back	1
in	1
memory,	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
the	1
farther	1
I	1
go	1
forward	1
in	1
my	1
judgment,	1
the	1
more	1
doubtful	1
becomes	1
my	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
my	1
action.	1
	1
In	1
history	1
we	1
find	1
a	1
very	1
similar	1
progress	1
of	1
conviction	1
concerning	1
the	1
part	1
played	1
by	1
free	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
affairs	1
of	1
humanity.	1
A	1
contemporary	1
event	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
indubitably	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
known	1
participants,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
remote	1
event	1
we	1
already	1
see	1
its	1
inevitable	1
results	1
which	1
prevent	1
our	1
considering	1
anything	1
else	1
possible.	1
And	1
the	1
farther	1
we	1
go	1
back	1
in	1
examining	1
events	1
the	1
less	1
arbitrary	1
do	1
they	1
appear.	1
	1
The	1
Austro-Prussian	1
war	1
appears	1
to	1
us	1
undoubtedly	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
crafty	1
conduct	1
of	1
Bismarck,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
The	1
Napoleonic	1
wars	1
still	1
seem	1
to	1
us,	1
though	1
already	1
questionably,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
their	1
heroes'	1
will.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
Crusades	1
we	1
already	1
see	1
an	1
event	1
occupying	1
its	1
definite	1
place	1
in	1
history	1
and	1
without	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
the	1
modern	1
history	1
of	1
Europe,	1
though	1
to	1
the	1
chroniclers	1
of	1
the	1
Crusades	1
that	1
event	1
appeared	1
as	1
merely	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
certain	1
people.	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
migration	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
enter	1
anyone's	1
head	1
today	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
renovation	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
world	1
depended	1
on	1
Attila's	1
caprice.	1
The	1
farther	1
back	1
in	1
history	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
our	1
observation	1
lies,	1
the	1
more	1
doubtful	1
does	1
the	1
free	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
become	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
manifest	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
consideration	1
is	1
the	1
degree	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
apprehend	1
that	1
endless	1
chain	1
of	1
causation	1
inevitably	1
demanded	1
by	1
reason,	1
in	1
which	1
each	1
phenomenon	1
comprehended,	1
and	1
therefore	1
man's	1
every	1
action,	1
must	1
have	1
its	1
definite	1
place	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
gone	1
before	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
what	1
will	1
follow.	1
	1
The	1
better	1
we	1
are	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
physiological,	1
psychological,	1
and	1
historical	1
laws	1
deduced	1
by	1
observation	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
man	1
is	1
controlled,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
correctly	1
we	1
perceive	1
the	1
physiological,	1
psychological,	1
and	1
historical	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
action,	1
and	1
the	1
simpler	1
the	1
action	1
we	1
are	1
observing	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
complex	1
the	1
character	1
and	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
question,	1
the	1
more	1
subject	1
to	1
inevitability	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
free	1
do	1
our	1
actions	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
others	1
appear.	1
	1
When	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
understand	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
an	1
action,	1
whether	1
a	1
crime,	1
a	1
good	1
action,	1
or	1
even	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
simply	1
nonmoral,	1
we	1
ascribe	1
a	1
greater	1
amount	1
of	1
freedom	1
to	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
crime	1
we	1
most	1
urgently	1
demand	1
the	1
punishment	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
act;	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
virtuous	1
act	1
we	1
rate	1
its	1
merit	1
most	1
highly.	1
In	1
an	1
indifferent	1
case	1
we	1
recognize	1
in	1
it	1
more	1
individuality,	1
originality,	1
and	1
independence.	1
But	1
if	1
even	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
act	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
recognize	1
a	1
certain	1
element	1
of	1
necessity	1
and	1
are	1
less	1
insistent	1
on	1
punishment	1
for	1
the	1
crime,	1
or	1
the	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
virtuous	1
act,	1
or	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
the	1
apparently	1
original	1
action.	1
That	1
a	1
criminal	1
was	1
reared	1
among	1
male	1
factors	1
mitigates	1
his	1
fault	1
in	1
our	1
eyes.	1
The	1
self-sacrifice	1
of	1
a	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
or	1
self-sacrifice	1
with	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1
reward,	1
is	1
more	1
comprehensible	1
than	1
gratuitous	1
self-sacrifice,	1
and	1
therefore	1
seems	1
less	1
deserving	1
of	1
sympathy	1
and	1
less	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
free	1
will.	1
The	1
founder	1
of	1
a	1
sect	1
or	1
party,	1
or	1
an	1
inventor,	1
impresses	1
us	1
less	1
when	1
we	1
know	1
how	1
or	1
by	1
what	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
his	1
activity.	1
If	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
large	1
range	1
of	1
examples,	1
if	1
our	1
observation	1
is	1
constantly	1
directed	1
to	1
seeking	1
the	1
correlation	1
of	1
cause	1
and	1
effect	1
in	1
people's	1
actions,	1
their	1
actions	1
appear	1
to	1
us	1
more	1
under	1
compulsion	1
and	1
less	1
free	1
the	1
more	1
correctly	1
we	1
connect	1
the	1
effects	1
with	1
the	1
causes.	1
If	1
we	1
examined	1
simple	1
actions	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
such	1
actions	1
under	1
observation,	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
their	1
inevitability	1
would	1
be	1
still	1
greater.	1
The	1
dishonest	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
dishonest	1
father,	1
the	1
misconduct	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
bad	1
company,	1
a	1
drunkard's	1
relapse	1
into	1
drunkenness,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
are	1
actions	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
us	1
less	1
free	1
the	1
better	1
we	1
understand	1
their	1
cause.	1
If	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
actions	1
we	1
are	1
considering	1
is	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
stage	1
of	1
mental	1
development,	1
like	1
a	1
child,	1
a	1
madman,	1
or	1
a	1
simpleton--then,	1
knowing	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
character	1
and	1
intelligence	1
in	1
question,	1
we	1
see	1
so	1
large	1
an	1
element	1
of	1
necessity	1
and	1
so	1
little	1
free	1
will	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
prompting	1
the	1
action	1
we	1
can	1
foretell	1
the	1
result.	1
	1
On	1
these	1
three	1
considerations	1
alone	1
is	1
based	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
irresponsibility	1
for	1
crimes	1
and	1
the	1
extenuating	1
circumstances	1
admitted	1
by	1
all	1
legislative	1
codes.	1
The	1
responsibility	1
appears	1
greater	1
or	1
less	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
placed	1
whose	1
action	1
is	1
being	1
judged,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
interval	1
of	1
time	1
between	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
its	1
investigation,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
causes	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
action.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Thus	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
and	1
inevitability	1
gradually	1
diminishes	1
or	1
increases	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
remoteness	1
of	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
causes	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
contemplate	1
a	1
man's	1
life.	1
	1
So	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
examine	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
is	1
well	1
known,	1
where	1
the	1
time	1
between	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
its	1
examination	1
is	1
great,	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
are	1
most	1
accessible,	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
maximum	1
of	1
inevitability	1
and	1
a	1
minimum	1
of	1
free	1
will.	1
If	1
we	1
examine	1
a	1
man	1
little	1
dependent	1
on	1
external	1
conditions,	1
whose	1
action	1
was	1
performed	1
very	1
recently,	1
and	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
whose	1
action	1
are	1
beyond	1
our	1
ken,	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
minimum	1
of	1
inevitability	1
and	1
a	1
maximum	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
In	1
neither	1
case--however	1
we	1
may	1
change	1
our	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
however	1
plain	1
we	1
may	1
make	1
to	1
ourselves	1
the	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
however	1
inaccessible	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
us,	1
however	1
long	1
or	1
short	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
however	1
intelligible	1
or	1
incomprehensible	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
may	1
be--can	1
we	1
ever	1
conceive	1
either	1
complete	1
freedom	1
or	1
complete	1
necessity.	1
	1
(1)	1
To	1
whatever	1
degree	1
we	1
may	1
imagine	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
exempt	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
we	1
never	1
get	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
in	1
space.	1
Every	1
human	1
action	1
is	1
inevitably	1
conditioned	1
by	1
what	1
surrounds	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
I	1
lift	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
fall.	1
My	1
action	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
free;	1
but	1
asking	1
myself	1
whether	1
I	1
could	1
raise	1
my	1
arm	1
in	1
every	1
direction,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
raised	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
least	1
obstruction	1
to	1
that	1
action	1
either	1
from	1
things	1
around	1
me	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
body.	1
I	1
chose	1
one	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
possible	1
directions	1
because	1
in	1
it	1
there	1
were	1
fewest	1
obstacles.	1
For	1
my	1
action	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
encounter	1
no	1
obstacles.	1
To	1
conceive	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
being	1
free	1
we	1
must	1
imagine	1
him	1
outside	1
space,	1
which	1
is	1
evidently	1
impossible.	1
	1
(2)	1
However	1
much	1
we	1
approximate	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
judgment	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
deed,	1
we	1
never	1
get	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
in	1
time.	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
examine	1
an	1
action	1
committed	1
a	1
second	1
ago	1
I	1
must	1
still	1
recognize	1
it	1
as	1
not	1
being	1
free,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
irrevocably	1
linked	1
to	1
the	1
moment	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
committed.	1
Can	1
I	1
lift	1
my	1
arm?	1
I	1
lift	1
it,	1
but	1
ask	1
myself:	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
abstained	1
from	1
lifting	1
my	1
arm	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
has	1
already	1
passed?	1
To	1
convince	1
myself	1
of	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
lift	1
it	1
the	1
next	1
moment.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
now	1
abstaining	1
from	1
doing	1
so	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
when	1
I	1
asked	1
the	1
question.	1
Time	1
has	1
gone	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
detain,	1
the	1
arm	1
I	1
then	1
lifted	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
the	1
arm	1
I	1
now	1
refrain	1
from	1
lifting,	1
nor	1
is	1
the	1
air	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
lifted	1
it	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
now	1
surrounds	1
me.	1
The	1
moment	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
first	1
movement	1
was	1
made	1
is	1
irrevocable,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
only	1
one	1
movement,	1
and	1
whatever	1
movement	1
I	1
made	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one.	1
That	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
lift	1
my	1
arm	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
does	1
not	1
prove	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
abstained	1
from	1
lifting	1
it	1
then.	1
And	1
since	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
only	1
one	1
movement	1
at	1
that	1
single	1
moment	1
of	1
time,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
any	1
other.	1
To	1
imagine	1
it	1
as	1
free,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
imagine	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
present,	1
on	1
the	1
boundary	1
between	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
future--that	1
is,	1
outside	1
time,	1
which	1
is	1
impossible.	1
	1
(3)	1
However	1
much	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
understanding	1
the	1
causes	1
may	1
be	1
increased,	1
we	1
never	1
reach	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
complete	1
freedom,	1
that	1
is,	1
an	1
absence	1
of	1
cause.	1
However	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
us	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
will	1
in	1
any	1
action,	1
our	1
own	1
or	1
another's,	1
the	1
first	1
demand	1
of	1
reason	1
is	1
the	1
assumption	1
of	1
and	1
search	1
for	1
a	1
cause,	1
for	1
without	1
a	1
cause	1
no	1
phenomenon	1
is	1
conceivable.	1
I	1
raise	1
my	1
arm	1
to	1
perform	1
an	1
action	1
independently	1
of	1
any	1
cause,	1
but	1
my	1
wish	1
to	1
perform	1
an	1
action	1
without	1
a	1
cause	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
action.	1
	1
But	1
even	1
if--imagining	1
a	1
man	1
quite	1
exempt	1
from	1
all	1
influences,	1
examining	1
only	1
his	1
momentary	1
action	1
in	1
the	1
present,	1
unevoked	1
by	1
any	1
cause--we	1
were	1
to	1
admit	1
so	1
infinitely	1
small	1
a	1
remainder	1
of	1
inevitability	1
as	1
equaled	1
zero,	1
we	1
should	1
even	1
then	1
not	1
have	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
complete	1
freedom	1
in	1
man,	1
for	1
a	1
being	1
uninfluenced	1
by	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
standing	1
outside	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
independent	1
of	1
cause,	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
imagine	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
quite	1
devoid	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
entirely	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
	1
(1)	1
However	1
we	1
may	1
increase	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
space	1
in	1
which	1
man	1
is	1
situated,	1
that	1
knowledge	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
complete,	1
for	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
conditions	1
is	1
as	1
infinite	1
as	1
the	1
infinity	1
of	1
space.	1
And	1
therefore	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
conditions	1
influencing	1
men	1
are	1
defined,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
complete	1
inevitability	1
but	1
a	1
certain	1
measure	1
of	1
freedom	1
remains.	1
	1
(2)	1
However	1
we	1
may	1
prolong	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
between	1
the	1
action	1
we	1
are	1
examining	1
and	1
the	1
judgment	1
upon	1
it,	1
that	1
period	1
will	1
be	1
finite,	1
while	1
time	1
is	1
infinite,	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
too	1
there	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
absolute	1
inevitability.	1
	1
(3)	1
However	1
accessible	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
causation	1
of	1
any	1
action,	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
know	1
the	1
whole	1
chain	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
endless,	1
and	1
so	1
again	1
we	1
never	1
reach	1
absolute	1
inevitability.	1
	1
But	1
besides	1
this,	1
even	1
if,	1
admitting	1
the	1
remaining	1
minimum	1
of	1
freedom	1
to	1
equal	1
zero,	1
we	1
assumed	1
in	1
some	1
given	1
case--as	1
for	1
instance	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
dying	1
man,	1
an	1
unborn	1
babe,	1
or	1
an	1
idiot--complete	1
absence	1
of	1
freedom,	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
we	1
should	1
destroy	1
the	1
very	1
conception	1
of	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
we	1
are	1
examining,	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
freedom	1
there	1
is	1
also	1
no	1
man.	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
subject	1
solely	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability	1
without	1
any	1
element	1
of	1
freedom	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
impossible	1
as	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
completely	1
free	1
action.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
to	1
imagine	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
entirely	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability	1
without	1
any	1
freedom,	1
we	1
must	1
assume	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
an	1
infinite	1
number	1
of	1
space	1
relations,	1
an	1
infinitely	1
long	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
and	1
an	1
infinite	1
series	1
of	1
causes.	1
	1
To	1
imagine	1
a	1
man	1
perfectly	1
free	1
and	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
we	1
must	1
imagine	1
him	1
all	1
alone,	1
beyond	1
space,	1
beyond	1
time,	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
dependence	1
on	1
cause.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
case,	1
if	1
inevitability	1
were	1
possible	1
without	1
freedom	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
reached	1
a	1
definition	1
of	1
inevitability	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability	1
itself,	1
that	1
is,	1
a	1
mere	1
form	1
without	1
content.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
case,	1
if	1
freedom	1
were	1
possible	1
without	1
inevitability	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
arrived	1
at	1
unconditioned	1
freedom	1
beyond	1
space,	1
time,	1
and	1
cause,	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
unconditioned	1
and	1
unlimited	1
would	1
be	1
nothing,	1
or	1
mere	1
content	1
without	1
form.	1
	1
We	1
should	1
in	1
fact	1
have	1
reached	1
those	1
two	1
fundamentals	1
of	1
which	1
man's	1
whole	1
outlook	1
on	1
the	1
universe	1
is	1
constructed--the	1
incomprehensible	1
essence	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
laws	1
defining	1
that	1
essence.	1
	1
Reason	1
says:	1
(1)	1
space	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
matter	1
that	1
give	1
it	1
visibility	1
is	1
infinite,	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
imagined	1
otherwise.	1
(2)	1
Time	1
is	1
infinite	1
motion	1
without	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
rest	1
and	1
is	1
unthinkable	1
otherwise.	1
(3)	1
The	1
connection	1
between	1
cause	1
and	1
effect	1
has	1
no	1
beginning	1
and	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
end.	1
	1
Consciousness	1
says:	1
(1)	1
I	1
alone	1
am,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
exists	1
is	1
but	1
me,	1
consequently	1
I	1
include	1
space.	1
(2)	1
I	1
measure	1
flowing	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
fixed	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
in	1
which	1
alone	1
I	1
am	1
conscious	1
of	1
myself	1
as	1
living,	1
consequently	1
I	1
am	1
outside	1
time.	1
(3)	1
I	1
am	1
beyond	1
cause,	1
for	1
I	1
feel	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
every	1
manifestation	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
Reason	1
gives	1
expression	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
Consciousness	1
gives	1
expression	1
to	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
Freedom	1
not	1
limited	1
by	1
anything	1
is	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
life,	1
in	1
man's	1
consciousness.	1
Inevitability	1
without	1
content	1
is	1
man's	1
reason	1
in	1
its	1
three	1
forms.	1
	1
Freedom	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
examined.	1
Inevitability	1
is	1
what	1
examines.	1
Freedom	1
is	1
the	1
content.	1
Inevitability	1
is	1
the	1
form.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
separating	1
the	1
two	1
sources	1
of	1
cognition,	1
related	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
form	1
to	1
content,	1
do	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
mutually	1
exclusive	1
and	1
separately	1
incomprehensible	1
conceptions	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
uniting	1
them	1
do	1
we	1
get	1
a	1
clear	1
conception	1
of	1
man's	1
life.	1
	1
Apart	1
from	1
these	1
two	1
concepts	1
which	1
in	1
their	1
union	1
mutually	1
define	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
form	1
and	1
content,	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
possible.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
certain	1
relation	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
to	1
inevitability,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
consciousness	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
of	1
nature	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
certain	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
nature	1
to	1
inevitability,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason.	1
	1
The	1
great	1
natural	1
forces	1
lie	1
outside	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
conscious	1
of	1
them;	1
we	1
call	1
those	1
forces	1
gravitation,	1
inertia,	1
electricity,	1
animal	1
force,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
man	1
and	1
we	1
call	1
that	1
freedom.	1
	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
gravitation,	1
incomprehensible	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
felt	1
by	1
every	1
man,	1
is	1
understood	1
by	1
us	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
subject	1
(from	1
the	1
first	1
knowledge	1
that	1
all	1
bodies	1
have	1
weight,	1
up	1
to	1
Newton's	1
law),	1
so	1
too	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
free	1
will,	1
incomprehensible	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
of	1
which	1
everyone	1
is	1
conscious,	1
is	1
intelligible	1
to	1
us	1
only	1
in	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
subject	1
(from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
dies,	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
complex	1
economic	1
and	1
historic	1
laws).	1
	1
All	1
knowledge	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
bringing	1
of	1
this	1
essence	1
of	1
life	1
under	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason.	1
	1
Man's	1
free	1
will	1
differs	1
from	1
every	1
other	1
force	1
in	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
directly	1
conscious	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
reason	1
it	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
differs	1
from	1
any	1
other	1
force.	1
The	1
forces	1
of	1
gravitation,	1
electricity,	1
or	1
chemical	1
affinity	1
are	1
only	1
distinguished	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
differently	1
defined	1
by	1
reason.	1
Just	1
so	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
is	1
distinguished	1
by	1
reason	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
forces	1
of	1
nature	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
definition	1
reason	1
gives	1
it.	1
Freedom,	1
apart	1
from	1
necessity,	1
that	1
is,	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason	1
that	1
define	1
it,	1
differs	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
from	1
gravitation,	1
or	1
heat,	1
or	1
the	1
force	1
that	1
makes	1
things	1
grow;	1
for	1
reason,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
momentary	1
undefinable	1
sensation	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
undefinable	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
moving	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies,	1
the	1
undefinable	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
heat	1
and	1
electricity,	1
or	1
of	1
chemical	1
affinity,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
vital	1
force,	1
forms	1
the	1
content	1
of	1
astronomy,	1
physics,	1
chemistry,	1
botany,	1
zoology,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
does	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
form	1
the	1
content	1
of	1
history.	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
every	1
science	1
is	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
this	1
unknown	1
essence	1
of	1
life	1
while	1
that	1
essence	1
itself	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
metaphysics,	1
even	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
in	1
human	1
beings	1
in	1
space,	1
in	1
time,	1
and	1
in	1
dependence	1
on	1
cause	1
forms	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
history,	1
while	1
free	1
will	1
itself	1
is	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
metaphysics.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
experimental	1
sciences	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
we	1
call	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
what	1
is	1
unknown	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
call	1
vital	1
force.	1
Vital	1
force	1
is	1
only	1
an	1
expression	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
remainder	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
So	1
also	1
in	1
history	1
what	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
call	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
what	1
is	1
unknown	1
we	1
call	1
free	1
will.	1
Free	1
will	1
is	1
for	1
history	1
only	1
an	1
expression	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
remainder	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
about	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
human	1
life.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
History	1
examines	1
the	1
manifestations	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
in	1
dependence	1
on	1
cause,	1
that	1
is,	1
it	1
defines	1
this	1
freedom	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason,	1
and	1
so	1
history	1
is	1
a	1
science	1
only	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
this	1
free	1
will	1
is	1
defined	1
by	1
those	1
laws.	1
	1
The	1
recognition	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
as	1
something	1
capable	1
of	1
influencing	1
historical	1
events,	1
that	1
is,	1
as	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
laws,	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
for	1
history	1
as	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
force	1
moving	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
astronomy.	1
	1
That	1
assumption	1
would	1
destroy	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
laws,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
any	1
science	1
whatever.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
even	1
a	1
single	1
body	1
moving	1
freely,	1
then	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
Kepler	1
and	1
Newton	1
are	1
negatived	1
and	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
any	1
longer	1
exists.	1
If	1
any	1
single	1
action	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
free	1
will,	1
then	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
historical	1
law	1
can	1
exist,	1
nor	1
any	1
conception	1
of	1
historical	1
events.	1
	1
For	1
history,	1
lines	1
exist	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
human	1
wills,	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
unknown	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
man's	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
moves	1
in	1
space,	1
time,	1
and	1
dependence	1
on	1
cause.	1
	1
The	1
more	1
this	1
field	1
of	1
motion	1
spreads	1
out	1
before	1
our	1
eyes,	1
the	1
more	1
evident	1
are	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
that	1
movement.	1
To	1
discover	1
and	1
define	1
those	1
laws	1
is	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
standpoint	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
history	1
now	1
regards	1
its	1
subject	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
it	1
now	1
follows,	1
seeking	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
man's	1
freewill,	1
a	1
scientific	1
enunciation	1
of	1
those	1
laws	1
is	1
impossible,	1
for	1
however	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
may	1
be	1
restricted,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
recognize	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
law,	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
law	1
becomes	1
impossible.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
reducing	1
this	1
element	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
to	1
the	1
infinitesimal,	1
that	1
is,	1
by	1
regarding	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
infinitely	1
small	1
quantity,	1
can	1
we	1
convince	1
ourselves	1
of	1
the	1
absolute	1
inaccessibility	1
of	1
the	1
causes,	1
and	1
then	1
instead	1
of	1
seeking	1
causes,	1
history	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
laws	1
as	1
its	1
problem.	1
	1
The	1
search	1
for	1
these	1
laws	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
begun	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
methods	1
of	1
thought	1
which	1
history	1
must	1
adopt	1
are	1
being	1
worked	1
out	1
simultaneously	1
with	1
the	1
self-destruction	1
toward	1
which--ever	1
dissecting	1
and	1
dissecting	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
phenomena--the	1
old	1
method	1
of	1
history	1
is	1
moving.	1
	1
All	1
human	1
sciences	1
have	1
traveled	1
along	1
that	1
path.	1
Arriving	1
at	1
infinitesimals,	1
mathematics,	1
the	1
most	1
exact	1
of	1
sciences,	1
abandons	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
analysis	1
and	1
enters	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
process	1
of	1
the	1
integration	1
of	1
unknown,	1
infinitely	1
small,	1
quantities.	1
Abandoning	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
cause,	1
mathematics	1
seeks	1
law,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
property	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
unknown,	1
infinitely	1
small,	1
elements.	1
	1
In	1
another	1
form	1
but	1
along	1
the	1
same	1
path	1
of	1
reflection	1
the	1
other	1
sciences	1
have	1
proceeded.	1
When	1
Newton	1
enunciated	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
gravity	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
or	1
the	1
earth	1
had	1
a	1
property	1
of	1
attraction;	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
bodies	1
from	1
the	1
largest	1
to	1
the	1
smallest	1
have	1
the	1
property	1
of	1
attracting	1
one	1
another,	1
that	1
is,	1
leaving	1
aside	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
bodies,	1
he	1
expressed	1
the	1
property	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
bodies	1
from	1
the	1
infinitely	1
large	1
to	1
the	1
infinitely	1
small.	1
The	1
same	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
natural	1
sciences:	1
leaving	1
aside	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
cause,	1
they	1
seek	1
for	1
laws.	1
History	1
stands	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
path.	1
And	1
if	1
history	1
has	1
for	1
its	1
object	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
of	1
humanity	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
narration	1
of	1
episodes	1
in	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
individuals,	1
it	1
too,	1
setting	1
aside	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
cause,	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
laws	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
inseparably	1
interconnected	1
infinitesimal	1
elements	1
of	1
free	1
will.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Copernicus	1
was	1
discovered	1
and	1
proved,	1
the	1
mere	1
recognition	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
sun	1
but	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
moves	1
sufficed	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
whole	1
cosmography	1
of	1
the	1
ancients.	1
By	1
disproving	1
that	1
law	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
possible	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
old	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
bodies,	1
but	1
without	1
disproving	1
it,	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
impossible	1
to	1
continue	1
studying	1
the	1
Ptolemaic	1
worlds.	1
But	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Copernicus	1
the	1
Ptolemaic	1
worlds	1
were	1
still	1
studied	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
said	1
and	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
births	1
or	1
of	1
crimes	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
mathematical	1
laws,	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
government	1
is	1
determined	1
by	1
certain	1
geographical	1
and	1
economic	1
conditions,	1
and	1
that	1
certain	1
relations	1
of	1
population	1
to	1
soil	1
produce	1
migrations	1
of	1
peoples,	1
the	1
foundations	1
on	1
which	1
history	1
had	1
been	1
built	1
were	1
destroyed	1
in	1
their	1
essence.	1
	1
By	1
refuting	1
these	1
new	1
laws	1
the	1
former	1
view	1
of	1
history	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
retained;	1
but	1
without	1
refuting	1
them	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
impossible	1
to	1
continue	1
studying	1
historic	1
events	1
as	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will.	1
For	1
if	1
a	1
certain	1
mode	1
of	1
government	1
was	1
established	1
or	1
certain	1
migrations	1
of	1
peoples	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
geographic,	1
ethnographic,	1
or	1
economic	1
conditions,	1
then	1
the	1
free	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
individuals	1
who	1
appear	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
have	1
established	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
government	1
or	1
occasioned	1
the	1
migrations	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
cause.	1
	1
And	1
yet	1
the	1
former	1
history	1
continues	1
to	1
be	1
studied	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
statistics,	1
geography,	1
political	1
economy,	1
comparative	1
philology,	1
and	1
geology,	1
which	1
directly	1
contradict	1
its	1
assumptions.	1
	1
The	1
struggle	1
between	1
the	1
old	1
views	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
was	1
long	1
and	1
stubbornly	1
fought	1
out	1
in	1
physical	1
philosophy.	1
Theology	1
stood	1
on	1
guard	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
views	1
and	1
accused	1
the	1
new	1
of	1
violating	1
revelation.	1
But	1
when	1
truth	1
conquered,	1
theology	1
established	1
itself	1
just	1
as	1
firmly	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
foundation.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
prolonged	1
and	1
stubborn	1
is	1
the	1
struggle	1
now	1
proceeding	1
between	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
conception	1
of	1
history,	1
and	1
theology	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
stands	1
on	1
guard	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
view,	1
and	1
accuses	1
the	1
new	1
view	1
of	1
subverting	1
revelation.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
one	1
case	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
the	1
struggle	1
provokes	1
passion	1
and	1
stifles	1
truth.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
there	1
is	1
fear	1
and	1
regret	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
edifice	1
constructed	1
through	1
the	1
ages,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
the	1
passion	1
for	1
destruction.	1
	1
To	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
rising	1
truths	1
of	1
physical	1
philosophy,	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
admitted	1
that	1
truth	1
it	1
would	1
destroy	1
faith	1
in	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
firmament,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
miracle	1
of	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun.	1
To	1
the	1
defenders	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
Copernicus	1
and	1
Newton,	1
to	1
Voltaire	1
for	1
example,	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
astronomy	1
destroyed	1
religion,	1
and	1
he	1
utilized	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
gravitation	1
as	1
a	1
weapon	1
against	1
religion.	1
	1
Just	1
so	1
it	1
now	1
seems	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
admit	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
soul,	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
institutions	1
of	1
state	1
and	1
church	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
built	1
up	1
on	1
those	1
conceptions.	1
	1
So	1
too,	1
like	1
Voltaire	1
in	1
his	1
time,	1
uninvited	1
defenders	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability	1
today	1
use	1
that	1
law	1
as	1
a	1
weapon	1
against	1
religion,	1
though	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability	1
in	1
history,	1
like	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Copernicus	1
in	1
astronomy,	1
far	1
from	1
destroying,	1
even	1
strengthens	1
the	1
foundation	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
institutions	1
of	1
state	1
and	1
church	1
are	1
erected.	1
	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
astronomy	1
then,	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
history	1
now,	1
the	1
whole	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
is	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
recognition	1
or	1
nonrecognition	1
of	1
something	1
absolute,	1
serving	1
as	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
visible	1
phenomena.	1
In	1
astronomy	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
immovability	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
in	1
history	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
personality--free	1
will.	1
	1
As	1
with	1
astronomy	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
recognizing	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
lay	1
in	1
abandoning	1
the	1
immediate	1
sensation	1
of	1
the	1
earth's	1
fixity	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
planets,	1
so	1
in	1
history	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
recognizing	1
the	1
subjection	1
of	1
personality	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
space,	1
time,	1
and	1
cause	1
lies	1
in	1
renouncing	1
the	1
direct	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
one's	1
own	1
personality.	1
But	1
as	1
in	1
astronomy	1
the	1
new	1
view	1
said:	1
"It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
but	1
by	1
admitting	1
its	1
immobility	1
we	1
arrive	1
at	1
absurdity,	1
while	1
by	1
admitting	1
its	1
motion	1
(which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
feel)	1
we	1
arrive	1
at	1
laws,"	1
so	1
also	1
in	1
history	1
the	1
new	1
view	1
says:	1
"It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
conscious	1
of	1
our	1
dependence,	1
but	1
by	1
admitting	1
our	1
free	1
will	1
we	1
arrive	1
at	1
absurdity,	1
while	1
by	1
admitting	1
our	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
on	1
time,	1
and	1
on	1
cause,	1
we	1
arrive	1
at	1
laws."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
case	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
renounce	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
an	1
unreal	1
immobility	1
in	1
space	1
and	1
to	1
recognize	1
a	1
motion	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
feel;	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
similarly	1
necessary	1
to	1
renounce	1
a	1
freedom	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
exist,	1
and	1
to	1
recognize	1
a	1
dependence	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
conscious.	1

Many	1

	1
Compliance	1
requirements	1
are	1
not	1
uniform	1
and	1
it	1
takes	1
a	1
considerable	1
effort,	1

many	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
"Well,	1
Prince,	1
so	1
Genoa	1
and	1
Lucca	1
are	1
now	1
just	1
family	1
estates	1
of	1
the	1
Buonapartes.	1
But	1
I	1
warn	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
means	1
war,	1
if	1
you	1
still	1
try	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
infamies	1
and	1
horrors	1
perpetrated	1
by	1
that	1
Antichrist--I	1
really	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
Antichrist--I	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
my	1
friend,	1
no	1
longer	1
my	1
'faithful	1
slave,'	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
yourself!	1
But	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
do?	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
have	1
frightened	1
you--sit	1
down	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
news."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
July,	1
1805,	1
and	1
the	1
speaker	1
was	1
the	1
well-known	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer,	1
maid	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
favorite	1
of	1
the	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna.	1
With	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
greeted	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Kuragin,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
high	1
rank	1
and	1
importance,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
her	1
reception.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
cough	1
for	1
some	1
days.	1
She	1
was,	1
as	1
she	1
said,	1
suffering	1
from	1
la	1
grippe;	1
grippe	1
being	1
then	1
a	1
new	1
word	1
in	1
St.	1
Petersburg,	1
used	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
elite.	1
	1
All	1
her	1
invitations	1
without	1
exception,	1
written	1
in	1
French,	1
and	1
delivered	1
by	1
a	1
scarlet-liveried	1
footman	1
that	1
morning,	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
do,	1
Count	1
(or	1
Prince),	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
spending	1
an	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
terrible,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
charmed	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
tonight	1
between	1
7	1
and	1
10--Annette	1
Scherer."	1
	1
"Heavens!	1
what	1
a	1
virulent	1
attack!"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
this	1
reception.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
entered,	1
wearing	1
an	1
embroidered	1
court	1
uniform,	1
knee	1
breeches,	1
and	1
shoes,	1
and	1
had	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
serene	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
flat	1
face.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
that	1
refined	1
French	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
grandfathers	1
not	1
only	1
spoke	1
but	1
thought,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
gentle,	1
patronizing	1
intonation	1
natural	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
importance	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
old	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
at	1
court.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
presenting	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
bald,	1
scented,	1
and	1
shining	1
head,	1
and	1
complacently	1
seated	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"First	1
of	1
all,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
are.	1
Set	1
your	1
friend's	1
mind	1
at	1
rest,"	1
said	1
he	1
without	1
altering	1
his	1
tone,	1
beneath	1
the	1
politeness	1
and	1
affected	1
sympathy	1
of	1
which	1
indifference	1
and	1
even	1
irony	1
could	1
be	1
discerned.	1
	1
"Can	1
one	1
be	1
well	1
while	1
suffering	1
morally?	1
Can	1
one	1
be	1
calm	1
in	1
times	1
like	1
these	1
if	1
one	1
has	1
any	1
feeling?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
"You	1
are	1
staying	1
the	1
whole	1
evening,	1
I	1
hope?"	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
ambassador's?	1
Today	1
is	1
Wednesday.	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
in	1
an	1
appearance	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"My	1
daughter	1
is	1
coming	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
there."	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
today's	1
fete	1
had	1
been	1
canceled.	1
I	1
confess	1
all	1
these	1
festivities	1
and	1
fireworks	1
are	1
becoming	1
wearisome."	1
	1
"If	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
it,	1
the	1
entertainment	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
off,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
who,	1
like	1
a	1
wound-up	1
clock,	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
said	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
believed.	1
	1
"Don't	1
tease!	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
decided	1
about	1
Novosiltsev's	1
dispatch?	1
You	1
know	1
everything."	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
one	1
say	1
about	1
it?"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
listless	1
tone.	1
"What	1
has	1
been	1
decided?	1
They	1
have	1
decided	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
burnt	1
his	1
boats,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
burn	1
ours."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
always	1
spoke	1
languidly,	1
like	1
an	1
actor	1
repeating	1
a	1
stale	1
part.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
despite	1
her	1
forty	1
years,	1
overflowed	1
with	1
animation	1
and	1
impulsiveness.	1
To	1
be	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
had	1
become	1
her	1
social	1
vocation	1
and,	1
sometimes	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
like	1
it,	1
she	1
became	1
enthusiastic	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
disappoint	1
the	1
expectations	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
her.	1
The	1
subdued	1
smile	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
her	1
faded	1
features,	1
always	1
played	1
round	1
her	1
lips	1
expressed,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
spoiled	1
child,	1
a	1
continual	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
charming	1
defect,	1
which	1
she	1
neither	1
wished,	1
nor	1
could,	1
nor	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary,	1
to	1
correct.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
on	1
political	1
matters	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
burst	1
out:	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
Austria.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
things,	1
but	1
Austria	1
never	1
has	1
wished,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
wish,	1
for	1
war.	1
She	1
is	1
betraying	1
us!	1
Russia	1
alone	1
must	1
save	1
Europe.	1
Our	1
gracious	1
sovereign	1
recognizes	1
his	1
high	1
vocation	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
it.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
faith	1
in!	1
Our	1
good	1
and	1
wonderful	1
sovereign	1
has	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
noblest	1
role	1
on	1
earth,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
virtuous	1
and	1
noble	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
him.	1
He	1
will	1
fulfill	1
his	1
vocation	1
and	1
crush	1
the	1
hydra	1
of	1
revolution,	1
which	1
has	1
become	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
this	1
murderer	1
and	1
villain!	1
We	1
alone	1
must	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
one....	1
Whom,	1
I	1
ask	1
you,	1
can	1
we	1
rely	1
on?...	1
England	1
with	1
her	1
commercial	1
spirit	1
will	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
loftiness	1
of	1
soul.	1
She	1
has	1
refused	1
to	1
evacuate	1
Malta.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
find,	1
and	1
still	1
seeks,	1
some	1
secret	1
motive	1
in	1
our	1
actions.	1
What	1
answer	1
did	1
Novosiltsev	1
get?	1
None.	1
The	1
English	1
have	1
not	1
understood	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
self-abnegation	1
of	1
our	1
Emperor	1
who	1
wants	1
nothing	1
for	1
himself,	1
but	1
only	1
desires	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
mankind.	1
And	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
promised?	1
Nothing!	1
And	1
what	1
little	1
they	1
have	1
promised	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
perform!	1
Prussia	1
has	1
always	1
declared	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
is	1
invincible,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
Europe	1
is	1
powerless	1
before	1
him....	1
And	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
that	1
Hardenburg	1
says,	1
or	1
Haugwitz	1
either.	1
This	1
famous	1
Prussian	1
neutrality	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
trap.	1
I	1
have	1
faith	1
only	1
in	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
lofty	1
destiny	1
of	1
our	1
adored	1
monarch.	1
He	1
will	1
save	1
Europe!"	1
	1
She	1
suddenly	1
paused,	1
smiling	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
impetuosity.	1
	1
"I	1
think,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"that	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
instead	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
Wintzingerode	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
captured	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia's	1
consent	1
by	1
assault.	1
You	1
are	1
so	1
eloquent.	1
Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea?"	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
moment.	1
A	1
propos,"	1
she	1
added,	1
becoming	1
calm	1
again,	1
"I	1
am	1
expecting	1
two	1
very	1
interesting	1
men	1
tonight,	1
le	1
Vicomte	1
de	1
Mortemart,	1
who	1
is	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
Montmorencys	1
through	1
the	1
Rohans,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
French	1
families.	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
genuine	1
emigres,	1
the	1
good	1
ones.	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Morio.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
profound	1
thinker?	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
Had	1
you	1
heard?"	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
to	1
meet	1
them,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"But	1
tell	1
me,"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
studied	1
carelessness	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
motive	1
of	1
his	1
visit,	1
"is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
wants	1
Baron	1
Funke	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
first	1
secretary	1
at	1
Vienna?	1
The	1
baron	1
by	1
all	1
accounts	1
is	1
a	1
poor	1
creature."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
wished	1
to	1
obtain	1
this	1
post	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
but	1
others	1
were	1
trying	1
through	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna	1
to	1
secure	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
baron.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
almost	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
anyone	1
else	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
criticize	1
what	1
the	1
Empress	1
desired	1
or	1
was	1
pleased	1
with.	1
	1
"Baron	1
Funke	1
has	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
by	1
her	1
sister,"	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
and	1
mournful	1
tone.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
named	1
the	1
Empress,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
face	1
suddenly	1
assumed	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
profound	1
and	1
sincere	1
devotion	1
and	1
respect	1
mingled	1
with	1
sadness,	1
and	1
this	1
occurred	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
mentioned	1
her	1
illustrious	1
patroness.	1
She	1
added	1
that	1
Her	1
Majesty	1
had	1
deigned	1
to	1
show	1
Baron	1
Funke	1
beaucoup	1
d'estime,	1
and	1
again	1
her	1
face	1
clouded	1
over	1
with	1
sadness.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
looked	1
indifferent.	1
But,	1
with	1
the	1
womanly	1
and	1
courtierlike	1
quickness	1
and	1
tact	1
habitual	1
to	1
her,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
wished	1
both	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him	1
(for	1
daring	1
to	1
speak	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
Empress)	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
console	1
him,	1
so	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"Now	1
about	1
your	1
family.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
your	1
daughter	1
came	1
out	1
everyone	1
has	1
been	1
enraptured	1
by	1
her?	1
They	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
amazingly	1
beautiful."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
bowed	1
to	1
signify	1
his	1
respect	1
and	1
gratitude.	1
	1
"I	1
often	1
think,"	1
she	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
smiling	1
amiably	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
political	1
and	1
social	1
topics	1
were	1
ended	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
intimate	1
conversation--"I	1
often	1
think	1
how	1
unfairly	1
sometimes	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
distributed.	1
Why	1
has	1
fate	1
given	1
you	1
two	1
such	1
splendid	1
children?	1
I	1
don't	1
speak	1
of	1
Anatole,	1
your	1
youngest.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
him,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
admitting	1
of	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
and	1
raising	1
her	1
eyebrows.	1
"Two	1
such	1
charming	1
children.	1
And	1
really	1
you	1
appreciate	1
them	1
less	1
than	1
anyone,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
don't	1
deserve	1
to	1
have	1
them."	1
	1
And	1
she	1
smiled	1
her	1
ecstatic	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
help	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"Lavater	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
I	1
lack	1
the	1
bump	1
of	1
paternity."	1
	1
"Don't	1
joke;	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
serious	1
talk	1
with	1
you.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
your	1
younger	1
son?	1
Between	1
ourselves"	1
(and	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
its	1
melancholy	1
expression),	1
"he	1
was	1
mentioned	1
at	1
Her	1
Majesty's	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
pitied...."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
answered	1
nothing,	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
significantly,	1
awaiting	1
a	1
reply.	1
He	1
frowned.	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
me	1
do?"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
did	1
all	1
a	1
father	1
could	1
for	1
their	1
education,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
both	1
turned	1
out	1
fools.	1
Hippolyte	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
quiet	1
fool,	1
but	1
Anatole	1
is	1
an	1
active	1
one.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
difference	1
between	1
them."	1
He	1
said	1
this	1
smiling	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
animated	1
than	1
usual,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
round	1
his	1
mouth	1
very	1
clearly	1
revealed	1
something	1
unexpectedly	1
coarse	1
and	1
unpleasant.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
are	1
children	1
born	1
to	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
you?	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
father	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
I	1
could	1
reproach	1
you	1
with,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
looking	1
up	1
pensively.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
your	1
faithful	1
slave	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
I	1
can	1
confess	1
that	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
the	1
bane	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
cross	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
bear.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
myself.	1
It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!"	1
	1
He	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
expressed	1
his	1
resignation	1
to	1
cruel	1
fate	1
by	1
a	1
gesture.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
meditated.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
marrying	1
your	1
prodigal	1
son	1
Anatole?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"They	1
say	1
old	1
maids	1
have	1
a	1
mania	1
for	1
matchmaking,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
don't	1
feel	1
that	1
weakness	1
in	1
myself	1
as	1
yet,	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
little	1
person	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
unhappy	1
with	1
her	1
father.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
yours,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
Bolkonskaya."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
though,	1
with	1
the	1
quickness	1
of	1
memory	1
and	1
perception	1
befitting	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
indicated	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
considering	1
this	1
information.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
sad	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
"that	1
Anatole	1
is	1
costing	1
me	1
forty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year?	1
And,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"what	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
five	1
years,	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
like	1
this?"	1
Presently	1
he	1
added:	1
"That's	1
what	1
we	1
fathers	1
have	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with....	1
Is	1
this	1
princess	1
of	1
yours	1
rich?"	1
	1
"Her	1
father	1
is	1
very	1
rich	1
and	1
stingy.	1
He	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
well-known	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
under	1
the	1
late	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
was	1
nicknamed	1
'the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia.'	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
clever	1
but	1
eccentric,	1
and	1
a	1
bore.	1
The	1
poor	1
girl	1
is	1
very	1
unhappy.	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
brother;	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
him,	1
he	1
married	1
Lise	1
Meinen	1
lately.	1
He	1
is	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
tonight."	1
	1
"Listen,	1
dear	1
Annette,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
suddenly	1
taking	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
hand	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
drawing	1
it	1
downwards.	1
"Arrange	1
that	1
affair	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
your	1
most	1
devoted	1
slave-slafe	1
with	1
an	1
f,	1
as	1
a	1
village	1
elder	1
of	1
mine	1
writes	1
in	1
his	1
reports.	1
She	1
is	1
rich	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
and	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
want."	1
	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
familiarity	1
and	1
easy	1
grace	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
the	1
maid	1
of	1
honor's	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
kissed	1
it,	1
and	1
swung	1
it	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
armchair,	1
looking	1
in	1
another	1
direction.	1
	1
"Attendez,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
reflecting,	1
"I'll	1
speak	1
to	1
Lise,	1
young	1
Bolkonski's	1
wife,	1
this	1
very	1
evening,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
thing	1
can	1
be	1
arranged.	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
your	1
family's	1
behalf	1
that	1
I'll	1
start	1
my	1
apprenticeship	1
as	1
old	1
maid."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room	1
was	1
gradually	1
filling.	1
The	1
highest	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
was	1
assembled	1
there:	1
people	1
differing	1
widely	1
in	1
age	1
and	1
character	1
but	1
alike	1
in	1
the	1
social	1
circle	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
belonged.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
daughter,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene,	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador's	1
entertainment;	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
ball	1
dress	1
and	1
her	1
badge	1
as	1
maid	1
of	1
honor.	1
The	1
youthful	1
little	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
known	1
as	1
la	1
femme	1
la	1
plus	1
seduisante	1
de	1
Petersbourg,	1
*	1
was	1
also	1
there.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
married	1
during	1
the	1
previous	1
winter,	1
and	1
being	1
pregnant	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
any	1
large	1
gatherings,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
small	1
receptions.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son,	1
Hippolyte,	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
Mortemart,	1
whom	1
he	1
introduced.	1
The	1
Abbe	1
Morio	1
and	1
many	1
others	1
had	1
also	1
come.	1
	1
	1
*	1
The	1
most	1
fascinating	1
woman	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
To	1
each	1
new	1
arrival	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
said,	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
my	1
aunt,"	1
or	1
"You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
my	1
aunt?"	1
and	1
very	1
gravely	1
conducted	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
lady,	1
wearing	1
large	1
bows	1
of	1
ribbon	1
in	1
her	1
cap,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
sailing	1
in	1
from	1
another	1
room	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
arrive;	1
and	1
slowly	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
visitor	1
to	1
her	1
aunt,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
mentioned	1
each	1
one's	1
name	1
and	1
then	1
left	1
them.	1
	1
Each	1
visitor	1
performed	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
greeting	1
this	1
old	1
aunt	1
whom	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
knew,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
wanted	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
cared	1
about;	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
observed	1
these	1
greetings	1
with	1
mournful	1
and	1
solemn	1
interest	1
and	1
silent	1
approval.	1
The	1
aunt	1
spoke	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
words,	1
about	1
their	1
health	1
and	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
Her	1
Majesty,	1
"who,	1
thank	1
God,	1
was	1
better	1
today."	1
And	1
each	1
visitor,	1
though	1
politeness	1
prevented	1
his	1
showing	1
impatience,	1
left	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
at	1
having	1
performed	1
a	1
vexatious	1
duty	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya	1
had	1
brought	1
some	1
work	1
in	1
a	1
gold-	1
embroidered	1
velvet	1
bag.	1
Her	1
pretty	1
little	1
upper	1
lip,	1
on	1
which	1
a	1
delicate	1
dark	1
down	1
was	1
just	1
perceptible,	1
was	1
too	1
short	1
for	1
her	1
teeth,	1
but	1
it	1
lifted	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
sweetly,	1
and	1
was	1
especially	1
charming	1
when	1
she	1
occasionally	1
drew	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
lower	1
lip.	1
As	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
a	1
thoroughly	1
attractive	1
woman,	1
her	1
defect--the	1
shortness	1
of	1
her	1
upper	1
lip	1
and	1
her	1
half-open	1
mouth--seemed	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
own	1
special	1
and	1
peculiar	1
form	1
of	1
beauty.	1
Everyone	1
brightened	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
pretty	1
young	1
woman,	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
mother,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health,	1
and	1
carrying	1
her	1
burden	1
so	1
lightly.	1
Old	1
men	1
and	1
dull	1
dispirited	1
young	1
ones	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
after	1
being	1
in	1
her	1
company	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
too	1
were	1
becoming,	1
like	1
her,	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health.	1
All	1
who	1
talked	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
at	1
each	1
word	1
saw	1
her	1
bright	1
smile	1
and	1
the	1
constant	1
gleam	1
of	1
her	1
white	1
teeth,	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
specially	1
amiable	1
mood	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
quick,	1
short,	1
swaying	1
steps,	1
her	1
workbag	1
on	1
her	1
arm,	1
and	1
gaily	1
spreading	1
out	1
her	1
dress	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
near	1
the	1
silver	1
samovar,	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
was	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
around	1
her.	1
"I	1
have	1
brought	1
my	1
work,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
French,	1
displaying	1
her	1
bag	1
and	1
addressing	1
all	1
present.	1
"Mind,	1
Annette,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
played	1
a	1
wicked	1
trick	1
on	1
me,"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
hostess.	1
"You	1
wrote	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
small	1
reception,	1
and	1
just	1
see	1
how	1
badly	1
I	1
am	1
dressed."	1
And	1
she	1
spread	1
out	1
her	1
arms	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
short-waisted,	1
lace-trimmed,	1
dainty	1
gray	1
dress,	1
girdled	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
ribbon	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
breast.	1
	1
"Soyez	1
tranquille,	1
Lise,	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
prettier	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,"	1
replied	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"You	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
and	1
still	1
in	1
French,	1
turning	1
to	1
a	1
general,	1
"my	1
husband	1
is	1
deserting	1
me?	1
He	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
himself	1
killed.	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
this	1
wretched	1
war	1
is	1
for?"	1
she	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
his	1
daughter,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
delightful	1
woman	1
this	1
little	1
princess	1
is!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
arrivals	1
was	1
a	1
stout,	1
heavily	1
built	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
close-cropped	1
hair,	1
spectacles,	1
the	1
light-colored	1
breeches	1
fashionable	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
ruffle,	1
and	1
a	1
brown	1
dress	1
coat.	1
This	1
stout	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
a	1
well-known	1
grandee	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
time	1
who	1
now	1
lay	1
dying	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
entered	1
either	1
the	1
military	1
or	1
civil	1
service,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
appearance	1
in	1
society.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
greeted	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
nod	1
she	1
accorded	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
hierarchy	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
lowest-grade	1
greeting,	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
something	1
too	1
large	1
and	1
unsuited	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
enter.	1
Though	1
he	1
was	1
certainly	1
rather	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
her	1
anxiety	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
clever	1
though	1
shy,	1
but	1
observant	1
and	1
natural,	1
expression	1
which	1
distinguished	1
him	1
from	1
everyone	1
else	1
in	1
that	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
exchanging	1
an	1
alarmed	1
glance	1
with	1
her	1
aunt	1
as	1
she	1
conducted	1
him	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
Pierre	1
murmured	1
something	1
unintelligible,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
something.	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
aunt	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
pleased	1
smile,	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
intimate	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
alarm	1
was	1
justified,	1
for	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
aunt	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
speech	1
about	1
Her	1
Majesty's	1
health.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
dismay	1
detained	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Morio?	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
man."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
scheme	1
for	1
perpetual	1
peace,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
hardly	1
feasible."	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
so?"	1
rejoined	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
and	1
get	1
away	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
now	1
committed	1
a	1
reverse	1
act	1
of	1
impoliteness.	1
First	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
a	1
lady	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
another	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
away.	1
With	1
his	1
head	1
bent,	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
feet	1
spread	1
apart,	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
his	1
reasons	1
for	1
thinking	1
the	1
abbe's	1
plan	1
chimerical.	1
	1
"We	1
will	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
later,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
And	1
having	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave,	1
she	1
resumed	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
watch,	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
at	1
any	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
conversation	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
flag.	1
As	1
the	1
foreman	1
of	1
a	1
spinning	1
mill,	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
set	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
work,	1
goes	1
round	1
and	1
notices	1
here	1
a	1
spindle	1
that	1
has	1
stopped	1
or	1
there	1
one	1
that	1
creaks	1
or	1
makes	1
more	1
noise	1
than	1
it	1
should,	1
and	1
hastens	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
machine	1
or	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
proper	1
motion,	1
so	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
moved	1
about	1
her	1
drawing	1
room,	1
approaching	1
now	1
a	1
silent,	1
now	1
a	1
too-noisy	1
group,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
slight	1
rearrangement	1
kept	1
the	1
conversational	1
machine	1
in	1
steady,	1
proper,	1
and	1
regular	1
motion.	1
But	1
amid	1
these	1
cares	1
her	1
anxiety	1
about	1
Pierre	1
was	1
evident.	1
She	1
kept	1
an	1
anxious	1
watch	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
group	1
round	1
Mortemart	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
there,	1
and	1
again	1
when	1
he	1
passed	1
to	1
another	1
group	1
whose	1
center	1
was	1
the	1
abbe.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
abroad,	1
and	1
this	1
reception	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
attended	1
in	1
Russia.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
intellectual	1
lights	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
were	1
gathered	1
there	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
a	1
toyshop,	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look,	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
any	1
clever	1
conversation	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
heard.	1
Seeing	1
the	1
self-confident	1
and	1
refined	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
very	1
profound.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Morio.	1
Here	1
the	1
conversation	1
seemed	1
interesting	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
own	1
views,	1
as	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
doing.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
swing.	1
The	1
spindles	1
hummed	1
steadily	1
and	1
ceaselessly	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
With	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
the	1
aunt,	1
beside	1
whom	1
sat	1
only	1
one	1
elderly	1
lady,	1
who	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
careworn	1
face	1
was	1
rather	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
this	1
brilliant	1
society,	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
had	1
settled	1
into	1
three	1
groups.	1
One,	1
chiefly	1
masculine,	1
had	1
formed	1
round	1
the	1
abbe.	1
Another,	1
of	1
young	1
people,	1
was	1
grouped	1
round	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
rosy,	1
though	1
rather	1
too	1
plump	1
for	1
her	1
age.	1
The	1
third	1
group	1
was	1
gathered	1
round	1
Mortemart	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
was	1
a	1
nice-looking	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
soft	1
features	1
and	1
polished	1
manners,	1
who	1
evidently	1
considered	1
himself	1
a	1
celebrity	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
politeness	1
modestly	1
placed	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
was	1
obviously	1
serving	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
treat	1
to	1
her	1
guests.	1
As	1
a	1
clever	1
maitre	1
d'hotel	1
serves	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
specially	1
choice	1
delicacy	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
meat	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
would	1
have	1
cared	1
to	1
eat,	1
so	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
guests,	1
first	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
abbe,	1
as	1
peculiarly	1
choice	1
morsels.	1
The	1
group	1
about	1
Mortemart	1
immediately	1
began	1
discussing	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien.	1
The	1
vicomte	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien	1
had	1
perished	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
magnanimity,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
particular	1
reasons	1
for	1
Buonaparte's	1
hatred	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes!	1
Do	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
Vicomte,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
feeling	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
a	1
la	1
Louis	1
XV	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
that	1
sentence:	1
"Contez	1
nous	1
cela,	1
Vicomte."	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
bowed	1
and	1
smiled	1
courteously	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
his	1
willingness	1
to	1
comply.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
arranged	1
a	1
group	1
round	1
him,	1
inviting	1
everyone	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
his	1
tale.	1
	1
"The	1
vicomte	1
knew	1
the	1
duc	1
personally,"	1
whispered	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guests.	1
"The	1
vicomte	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
raconteur,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
another.	1
"How	1
evidently	1
he	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
society,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
a	1
third;	1
and	1
the	1
vicomte	1
was	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
choicest	1
and	1
most	1
advantageous	1
style,	1
like	1
a	1
well-garnished	1
joint	1
of	1
roast	1
beef	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
dish.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
wished	1
to	1
begin	1
his	1
story	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile.	1
	1
"Come	1
over	1
here,	1
Helene,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
to	1
the	1
beautiful	1
young	1
princess	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
some	1
way	1
off,	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
another	1
group.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
smiled.	1
She	1
rose	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
unchanging	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
first	1
entered	1
the	1
room--the	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
perfectly	1
beautiful	1
woman.	1
With	1
a	1
slight	1
rustle	1
of	1
her	1
white	1
dress	1
trimmed	1
with	1
moss	1
and	1
ivy,	1
with	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
white	1
shoulders,	1
glossy	1
hair,	1
and	1
sparkling	1
diamonds,	1
she	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
made	1
way	1
for	1
her,	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
smiling	1
on	1
all,	1
as	1
if	1
graciously	1
allowing	1
each	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
admiring	1
her	1
beautiful	1
figure	1
and	1
shapely	1
shoulders,	1
back,	1
and	1
bosom--which	1
in	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
those	1
days	1
were	1
very	1
much	1
exposed--	1
and	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
glamour	1
of	1
a	1
ballroom	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
moved	1
toward	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
Helene	1
was	1
so	1
lovely	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
she	1
not	1
show	1
any	1
trace	1
of	1
coquetry,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
even	1
appeared	1
shy	1
of	1
her	1
unquestionable	1
and	1
all	1
too	1
victorious	1
beauty.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
wish,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
unable,	1
to	1
diminish	1
its	1
effect.	1
	1
"How	1
lovely!"	1
said	1
everyone	1
who	1
saw	1
her;	1
and	1
the	1
vicomte	1
lifted	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
startled	1
by	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
when	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
seat	1
opposite	1
and	1
beamed	1
upon	1
him	1
also	1
with	1
her	1
unchanging	1
smile.	1
	1
"Madame,	1
I	1
doubt	1
my	1
ability	1
before	1
such	1
an	1
audience,"	1
said	1
he,	1
smilingly	1
inclining	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
rested	1
her	1
bare	1
round	1
arm	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
and	1
considered	1
a	1
reply	1
unnecessary.	1
She	1
smilingly	1
waited.	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
being	1
told	1
she	1
sat	1
upright,	1
glancing	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
beautiful	1
round	1
arm,	1
altered	1
in	1
shape	1
by	1
its	1
pressure	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
beautiful	1
bosom,	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
readjusted	1
a	1
diamond	1
necklace.	1
From	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
she	1
smoothed	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress,	1
and	1
whenever	1
the	1
story	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
at	1
once	1
adopted	1
just	1
the	1
expression	1
she	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
maid	1
of	1
honor's	1
face,	1
and	1
again	1
relapsed	1
into	1
her	1
radiant	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
also	1
left	1
the	1
tea	1
table	1
and	1
followed	1
Helene.	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
I'll	1
get	1
my	1
work....	1
Now	1
then,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
of?"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte.	1
"Fetch	1
me	1
my	1
workbag."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
movement	1
as	1
the	1
princess,	1
smiling	1
and	1
talking	1
merrily	1
to	1
everyone	1
at	1
once,	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
gaily	1
arranged	1
herself	1
in	1
her	1
seat.	1
	1
"Now	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
right,"	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
asking	1
the	1
vicomte	1
to	1
begin,	1
she	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
work.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
workbag,	1
joined	1
the	1
circle	1
and	1
moving	1
a	1
chair	1
close	1
to	1
hers	1
seated	1
himself	1
beside	1
her.	1
	1
Le	1
charmant	1
Hippolyte	1
was	1
surprising	1
by	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
resemblance	1
to	1
his	1
beautiful	1
sister,	1
but	1
yet	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
resemblance	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
ugly.	1
His	1
features	1
were	1
like	1
his	1
sister's,	1
but	1
while	1
in	1
her	1
case	1
everything	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
joyous,	1
self-	1
satisfied,	1
youthful,	1
and	1
constant	1
smile	1
of	1
animation,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
wonderful	1
classic	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
figure,	1
his	1
face	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
dulled	1
by	1
imbecility	1
and	1
a	1
constant	1
expression	1
of	1
sullen	1
self-	1
confidence,	1
while	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
weak.	1
His	1
eyes,	1
nose,	1
and	1
mouth	1
all	1
seemed	1
puckered	1
into	1
a	1
vacant,	1
wearied	1
grimace,	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
always	1
fell	1
into	1
unnatural	1
positions.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ghost	1
story?"	1
said	1
he,	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
hastily	1
adjusting	1
his	1
lorgnette,	1
as	1
if	1
without	1
this	1
instrument	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
"Why	1
no,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
the	1
astonished	1
narrator,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"Because	1
I	1
hate	1
ghost	1
stories,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
uttered	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
spoke	1
with	1
such	1
self-confidence	1
that	1
his	1
hearers	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sure	1
whether	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
very	1
witty	1
or	1
very	1
stupid.	1
He	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
dark-green	1
dress	1
coat,	1
knee	1
breeches	1
of	1
the	1
color	1
of	1
cuisse	1
de	1
nymphe	1
effrayee,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it,	1
shoes,	1
and	1
silk	1
stockings.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
told	1
his	1
tale	1
very	1
neatly.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
anecdote,	1
then	1
current,	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien	1
had	1
gone	1
secretly	1
to	1
Paris	1
to	1
visit	1
Mademoiselle	1
George;	1
that	1
at	1
her	1
house	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
Bonaparte,	1
who	1
also	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
famous	1
actress'	1
favors,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
Napoleon	1
happened	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fainting	1
fits	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
subject,	1
and	1
was	1
thus	1
at	1
the	1
duc's	1
mercy.	1
The	1
latter	1
spared	1
him,	1
and	1
this	1
magnanimity	1
Bonaparte	1
subsequently	1
repaid	1
by	1
death.	1
	1
The	1
story	1
was	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
interesting,	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
rivals	1
suddenly	1
recognized	1
one	1
another;	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
looked	1
agitated.	1
	1
"Charming!"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
with	1
an	1
inquiring	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
	1
"Charming!"	1
whispered	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
sticking	1
the	1
needle	1
into	1
her	1
work	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
testify	1
that	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
fascination	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
appreciated	1
this	1
silent	1
praise	1
and	1
smiling	1
gratefully	1
prepared	1
to	1
continue,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
who	1
had	1
kept	1
a	1
watchful	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
so	1
alarmed	1
her,	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
too	1
loudly	1
and	1
vehemently	1
with	1
the	1
abbe,	1
so	1
she	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
rescue.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
abbe	1
about	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
the	1
latter,	1
evidently	1
interested	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
simple-minded	1
eagerness,	1
was	1
explaining	1
his	1
pet	1
theory.	1
Both	1
were	1
talking	1
and	1
listening	1
too	1
eagerly	1
and	1
too	1
naturally,	1
which	1
was	1
why	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
disapproved.	1
	1
"The	1
means	1
are...	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
people,"	1
the	1
abbe	1
was	1
saying.	1
"It	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
for	1
one	1
powerful	1
nation	1
like	1
Russia--barbaric	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be--to	1
place	1
herself	1
disinterestedly	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
an	1
alliance	1
having	1
for	1
its	1
object	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
of	1
Europe,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
save	1
the	1
world!"	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
that	1
balance?"	1
Pierre	1
was	1
beginning.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
came	1
up	1
and,	1
looking	1
severely	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
asked	1
the	1
Italian	1
how	1
he	1
stood	1
Russian	1
climate.	1
The	1
Italian's	1
face	1
instantly	1
changed	1
and	1
assumed	1
an	1
offensively	1
affected,	1
sugary	1
expression,	1
evidently	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
conversing	1
with	1
women.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
enchanted	1
by	1
the	1
brilliancy	1
of	1
the	1
wit	1
and	1
culture	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
more	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
feminine	1
society,	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
being	1
received,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
climate,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Not	1
letting	1
the	1
abbe	1
and	1
Pierre	1
escape,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
the	1
more	1
conveniently	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
under	1
observation,	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
larger	1
circle.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
another	1
visitor	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room:	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski,	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
husband.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
young	1
man,	1
of	1
medium	1
height,	1
with	1
firm,	1
clearcut	1
features.	1
Everything	1
about	1
him,	1
from	1
his	1
weary,	1
bored	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
quiet,	1
measured	1
step,	1
offered	1
a	1
most	1
striking	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
quiet,	1
little	1
wife.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
knew	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
but	1
had	1
found	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
tiresome	1
that	1
it	1
wearied	1
him	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
or	1
listen	1
to	1
them.	1
And	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
faces	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
so	1
tedious,	1
none	1
seemed	1
to	1
bore	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
pretty	1
wife.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
grimace	1
that	1
distorted	1
his	1
handsome	1
face,	1
kissed	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
hand,	1
and	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
scanned	1
the	1
whole	1
company.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
Prince?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"General	1
Kutuzov,"	1
said	1
Bolkonski,	1
speaking	1
French	1
and	1
stressing	1
the	1
last	1
syllable	1
of	1
the	1
general's	1
name	1
like	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
"has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
aide-de-camp...."	1
	1
"And	1
Lise,	1
your	1
wife?"	1
	1
"She	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
country."	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
deprive	1
us	1
of	1
your	1
charming	1
wife?"	1
	1
"Andre,"	1
said	1
his	1
wife,	1
addressing	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
coquettish	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
other	1
men,	1
"the	1
vicomte	1
has	1
been	1
telling	1
us	1
such	1
a	1
tale	1
about	1
Mademoiselle	1
George	1
and	1
Buonaparte!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
watched	1
him	1
with	1
glad,	1
affectionate	1
eyes,	1
now	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
arm.	1
Before	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
frowned	1
again,	1
expressing	1
his	1
annoyance	1
with	1
whoever	1
was	1
touching	1
his	1
arm,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Pierre's	1
beaming	1
face	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
unexpectedly	1
kind	1
and	1
pleasant	1
smile.	1
	1
"There	1
now!...	1
So	1
you,	1
too,	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
world?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
here,"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
"I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
supper	1
with	1
you.	1
May	1
I?"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
vicomte	1
who	1
was	1
continuing	1
his	1
story.	1
	1
"No,	1
impossible!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
laughing	1
and	1
pressing	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
question.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
more,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
rose	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
pass.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
excuse	1
me,	1
dear	1
Vicomte,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
holding	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
way	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
rising.	1
"This	1
unfortunate	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
ambassador's	1
deprives	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
obliges	1
me	1
to	1
interrupt	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
your	1
enchanting	1
party,"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
His	1
daughter,	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
chairs,	1
lightly	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress,	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
shone	1
still	1
more	1
radiantly	1
on	1
her	1
beautiful	1
face.	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
rapturous,	1
almost	1
frightened,	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
him.	1
	1
"Very	1
lovely,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Very,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
In	1
passing	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
seized	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna:	1
"Educate	1
this	1
bear	1
for	1
me!	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
staying	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
society.	1
Nothing	1
is	1
so	1
necessary	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
clever	1
women."	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
smiled	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
Pierre	1
in	1
hand.	1
She	1
knew	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
connection	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili's.	1
The	1
elderly	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
aunt	1
rose	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
overtook	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
All	1
the	1
affectation	1
of	1
interest	1
she	1
had	1
assumed	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
kindly	1
and	1
tear-worn	1
face	1
and	1
it	1
now	1
expressed	1
only	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear.	1
	1
"How	1
about	1
my	1
son	1
Boris,	1
Prince?"	1
said	1
she,	1
hurrying	1
after	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
"I	1
can't	1
remain	1
any	1
longer	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
news	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
boy."	1
	1
Although	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
listened	1
reluctantly	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
politely	1
to	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady,	1
even	1
betraying	1
some	1
impatience,	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
ingratiating	1
and	1
appealing	1
smile,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
go	1
away.	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
it	1
cost	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards	1
at	1
once?"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"Believe	1
me,	1
Princess,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
can,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
I	1
should	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
appeal	1
to	1
Rumyantsev	1
through	1
Prince	1
Golitsyn.	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
way."	1
	1
The	1
elderly	1
lady	1
was	1
a	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya,	1
belonging	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
families	1
in	1
Russia,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
poor,	1
and	1
having	1
long	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
society	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
former	1
influential	1
connections.	1
She	1
had	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
procure	1
an	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
Guards	1
for	1
her	1
only	1
son.	1
It	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
solely	1
to	1
meet	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
obtained	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
and	1
had	1
sat	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
vicomte's	1
story.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
words	1
frightened	1
her,	1
an	1
embittered	1
look	1
clouded	1
her	1
once	1
handsome	1
face,	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment;	1
then	1
she	1
smiled	1
again	1
and	1
clutched	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
arm	1
more	1
tightly.	1
	1
"Listen	1
to	1
me,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
asked	1
you	1
for	1
anything	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
will	1
again,	1
nor	1
have	1
I	1
ever	1
reminded	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
friendship	1
for	1
you;	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
for	1
God's	1
sake	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
son--and	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
regard	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
benefactor,"	1
she	1
added	1
hurriedly.	1
"No,	1
don't	1
be	1
angry,	1
but	1
promise!	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
Golitsyn	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
refused.	1
Be	1
the	1
kindhearted	1
man	1
you	1
always	1
were,"	1
she	1
said,	1
trying	1
to	1
smile	1
though	1
tears	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Papa,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
late,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
turning	1
her	1
beautiful	1
head	1
and	1
looking	1
over	1
her	1
classically	1
molded	1
shoulder	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
waiting	1
by	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Influence	1
in	1
society,	1
however,	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
which	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
economized	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
last.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
knew	1
this,	1
and	1
having	1
once	1
realized	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
asked	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
begged	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
himself,	1
he	1
became	1
chary	1
of	1
using	1
his	1
influence.	1
But	1
in	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya's	1
case	1
he	1
felt,	1
after	1
her	1
second	1
appeal,	1
something	1
like	1
qualms	1
of	1
conscience.	1
She	1
had	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
quite	1
true;	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
indebted	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
steps	1
in	1
his	1
career.	1
Moreover,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
her	1
manners	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
women--	1
mostly	1
mothers--who,	1
having	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
their	1
minds,	1
will	1
not	1
rest	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
gained	1
their	1
end,	1
and	1
are	1
prepared	1
if	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
insisting	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
after	1
hour,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
make	1
scenes.	1
This	1
last	1
consideration	1
moved	1
him.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
familiarity	1
and	1
weariness	1
of	1
tone,	1
"it	1
is	1
almost	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
ask;	1
but	1
to	1
prove	1
my	1
devotion	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
respect	1
your	1
father's	1
memory,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
impossible--your	1
son	1
shall	1
be	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards.	1
Here	1
is	1
my	1
hand	1
on	1
it.	1
Are	1
you	1
satisfied?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
benefactor!	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
expected	1
from	1
you--I	1
knew	1
your	1
kindness!"	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
"Wait--just	1
a	1
word!	1
When	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards..."	1
she	1
faltered.	1
"You	1
are	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich	1
Kutuzov...	1
recommend	1
Boris	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
adjutant!	1
Then	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
rest,	1
and	1
then..."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
smiled.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
won't	1
promise	1
that.	1
You	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
Kutuzov	1
is	1
pestered	1
since	1
his	1
appointment	1
as	1
Commander	1
in	1
Chief.	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
himself	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Moscow	1
ladies	1
have	1
conspired	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
all	1
their	1
sons	1
as	1
adjutants."	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
do	1
promise!	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
you	1
go!	1
My	1
dear	1
benefactor..."	1
	1
"Papa,"	1
said	1
his	1
beautiful	1
daughter	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
as	1
before,	1
"we	1
shall	1
be	1
late."	1
	1
"Well,	1
au	1
revoir!	1
Good-bye!	1
You	1
hear	1
her?"	1
	1
"Then	1
tomorrow	1
you	1
will	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor?"	1
	1
"Certainly;	1
but	1
about	1
Kutuzov,	1
I	1
don't	1
promise."	1
	1
"Do	1
promise,	1
do	1
promise,	1
Vasili!"	1
cried	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
coquettish	1
girl,	1
which	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
probably	1
came	1
naturally	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
was	1
now	1
very	1
ill-suited	1
to	1
her	1
careworn	1
face.	1
	1
Apparently	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
her	1
age	1
and	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
employed	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
feminine	1
arts.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
gone	1
her	1
face	1
resumed	1
its	1
former	1
cold,	1
artificial	1
expression.	1
She	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
group	1
where	1
the	1
vicomte	1
was	1
still	1
talking,	1
and	1
again	1
pretended	1
to	1
listen,	1
while	1
waiting	1
till	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
time	1
to	1
leave.	1
Her	1
task	1
was	1
accomplished.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
latest	1
comedy,	1
the	1
coronation	1
at	1
Milan?"	1
asked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"and	1
of	1
the	1
comedy	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Genoa	1
and	1
Lucca	1
laying	1
their	1
petitions	1
before	1
Monsieur	1
Buonaparte,	1
and	1
Monsieur	1
Buonaparte	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
throne	1
and	1
granting	1
the	1
petitions	1
of	1
the	1
nations?	1
Adorable!	1
It	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
one's	1
head	1
whirl!	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
had	1
gone	1
crazy."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
	1
"'Dieu	1
me	1
la	1
donne,	1
gare	1
a	1
qui	1
la	1
touche!'	1
*	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
fine	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
that,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
repeating	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
Italian:	1
"'Dio	1
mi	1
l'ha	1
dato.	1
Guai	1
a	1
chi	1
la	1
tocchi!'"	1
	1
	1
*	1
God	1
has	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
who	1
touches	1
it	1
beware!	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
this	1
will	1
prove	1
the	1
last	1
drop	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
glass	1
run	1
over,"	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
continued.	1
"The	1
sovereigns	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
endure	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
menace	1
to	1
everything."	1
	1
"The	1
sovereigns?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
Russia,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
polite	1
but	1
hopeless:	1
"The	1
sovereigns,	1
madame...	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
done	1
for	1
Louis	1
XVII,	1
for	1
the	1
Queen,	1
or	1
for	1
Madame	1
Elizabeth?	1
Nothing!"	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
animated.	1
"And	1
believe	1
me,	1
they	1
are	1
reaping	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
betrayal	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbon	1
cause.	1
The	1
sovereigns!	1
Why,	1
they	1
are	1
sending	1
ambassadors	1
to	1
compliment	1
the	1
usurper."	1
	1
And	1
sighing	1
disdainfully,	1
he	1
again	1
changed	1
his	1
position.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
vicomte	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
through	1
his	1
lorgnette,	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
completely	1
round	1
toward	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
and	1
having	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
needle	1
began	1
tracing	1
the	1
Conde	1
coat	1
of	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
He	1
explained	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
gravity	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
"Baton	1
de	1
gueules,	1
engrele	1
de	1
gueules	1
d'azur--maison	1
Conde,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
listened,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"If	1
Buonaparte	1
remains	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
France	1
a	1
year	1
longer,"	1
the	1
vicomte	1
continued,	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
better	1
acquainted	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,	1
does	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
others	1
but	1
follows	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts,	1
"things	1
will	1
have	1
gone	1
too	1
far.	1
By	1
intrigues,	1
violence,	1
exile,	1
and	1
executions,	1
French	1
society--I	1
mean	1
good	1
French	1
society--will	1
have	1
been	1
forever	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
then..."	1
	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands.	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
remark,	1
for	1
the	1
conversation	1
interested	1
him,	1
but	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
who	1
had	1
him	1
under	1
observation,	1
interrupted:	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
the	1
melancholy	1
which	1
always	1
accompanied	1
any	1
reference	1
of	1
hers	1
to	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family,	1
"has	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
people	1
themselves	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
own	1
form	1
of	1
government;	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
once	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
usurper,	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
will	1
certainly	1
throw	1
itself	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
its	1
rightful	1
king,"	1
she	1
concluded,	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
amiable	1
to	1
the	1
royalist	1
emigrant.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
doubtful,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Monsieur	1
le	1
Vicomte	1
quite	1
rightly	1
supposes	1
that	1
matters	1
have	1
already	1
gone	1
too	1
far.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
regime."	1
	1
"From	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
heard,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
blushing	1
and	1
breaking	1
into	1
the	1
conversation,	1
"almost	1
all	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
has	1
already	1
gone	1
over	1
to	1
Bonaparte's	1
side."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
Buonapartists	1
who	1
say	1
that,"	1
replied	1
the	1
vicomte	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
"At	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
real	1
state	1
of	1
French	1
public	1
opinion."	1
	1
"Bonaparte	1
has	1
said	1
so,"	1
remarked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
was	1
aiming	1
his	1
remarks	1
at	1
him,	1
though	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"'I	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
glory,	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
it,'"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence,	1
again	1
quoting	1
Napoleon's	1
words.	1
"'I	1
opened	1
my	1
antechambers	1
and	1
they	1
crowded	1
in.'	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
far	1
he	1
was	1
justified	1
in	1
saying	1
so."	1
	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least,"	1
replied	1
the	1
vicomte.	1
"After	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
duc	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
partial	1
ceased	1
to	1
regard	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
hero.	1
If	1
to	1
some	1
people,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"he	1
ever	1
was	1
a	1
hero,	1
after	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
duc	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
martyr	1
more	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
one	1
hero	1
less	1
on	1
earth."	1
	1
Before	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
smile	1
their	1
appreciation	1
of	1
the	1
vicomte's	1
epigram,	1
Pierre	1
again	1
broke	1
into	1
the	1
conversation,	1
and	1
though	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
felt	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
something	1
inappropriate,	1
she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
stop	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien,"	1
declared	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
"was	1
a	1
political	1
necessity,	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
showed	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul	1
by	1
not	1
fearing	1
to	1
take	1
on	1
himself	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
of	1
that	1
deed."	1
	1
"Dieu!	1
Mon	1
Dieu!"	1
muttered	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
a	1
terrified	1
whisper.	1
	1
"What,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre...	1
Do	1
you	1
consider	1
that	1
assassination	1
shows	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
smiling	1
and	1
drawing	1
her	1
work	1
nearer	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
exclaimed	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"Capital!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
English,	1
and	1
began	1
slapping	1
his	1
knee	1
with	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
solemnly	1
at	1
his	1
audience	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
and	1
continued.	1
	1
"I	1
say	1
so,"	1
he	1
continued	1
desperately,	1
"because	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
Revolution	1
leaving	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
anarchy,	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
alone	1
understood	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
quelled	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
good,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stop	1
short	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
one	1
man's	1
life."	1
	1
"Won't	1
you	1
come	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
table?"	1
suggested	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
But	1
Pierre	1
continued	1
his	1
speech	1
without	1
heeding	1
her.	1
	1
"No,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
eager,	1
"Napoleon	1
is	1
great	1
because	1
he	1
rose	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
suppressed	1
its	1
abuses,	1
preserved	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
it--equality	1
of	1
citizenship	1
and	1
freedom	1
of	1
speech	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
press--and	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
did	1
he	1
obtain	1
power."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
if	1
having	1
obtained	1
power,	1
without	1
availing	1
himself	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
commit	1
murder	1
he	1
had	1
restored	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
rightful	1
king,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
man,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
vicomte.	1
	1
"He	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
that.	1
The	1
people	1
only	1
gave	1
him	1
power	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
rid	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
man.	1
The	1
Revolution	1
was	1
a	1
grand	1
thing!"	1
continued	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
betraying	1
by	1
this	1
desperate	1
and	1
provocative	1
proposition	1
his	1
extreme	1
youth	1
and	1
his	1
wish	1
to	1
express	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"What?	1
Revolution	1
and	1
regicide	1
a	1
grand	1
thing?...	1
Well,	1
after	1
that...	1
But	1
won't	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
other	1
table?"	1
repeated	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"Rousseau's	1
Contrat	1
Social,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte	1
with	1
a	1
tolerant	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
regicide,	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
about	1
ideas."	1
	1
"Yes:	1
ideas	1
of	1
robbery,	1
murder,	1
and	1
regicide,"	1
again	1
interjected	1
an	1
ironical	1
voice.	1
	1
"Those	1
were	1
extremes,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
important.	1
What	1
is	1
important	1
are	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
man,	1
emancipation	1
from	1
prejudices,	1
and	1
equality	1
of	1
citizenship,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
ideas	1
Napoleon	1
has	1
retained	1
in	1
full	1
force."	1
	1
"Liberty	1
and	1
equality,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte	1
contemptuously,	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
last	1
deciding	1
seriously	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
this	1
youth	1
how	1
foolish	1
his	1
words	1
were,	1
"high-sounding	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
discredited.	1
Who	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
liberty	1
and	1
equality?	1
Even	1
our	1
Saviour	1
preached	1
liberty	1
and	1
equality.	1
Have	1
people	1
since	1
the	1
Revolution	1
become	1
happier?	1
On	1
the	1
contrary.	1
We	1
wanted	1
liberty,	1
but	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
destroyed	1
it."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
kept	1
looking	1
with	1
an	1
amused	1
smile	1
from	1
Pierre	1
to	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
vicomte	1
to	1
their	1
hostess.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
outburst	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
despite	1
her	1
social	1
experience,	1
was	1
horror-struck.	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
Pierre's	1
sacrilegious	1
words	1
had	1
not	1
exasperated	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
and	1
had	1
convinced	1
herself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
stop	1
him,	1
she	1
rallied	1
her	1
forces	1
and	1
joined	1
the	1
vicomte	1
in	1
a	1
vigorous	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
orator.	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"how	1
do	1
you	1
explain	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
executing	1
a	1
duc--or	1
even	1
an	1
ordinary	1
man	1
who--is	1
innocent	1
and	1
untried?"	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
"to	1
ask	1
how	1
monsieur	1
explains	1
the	1
18th	1
Brumaire;	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
an	1
imposture?	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
swindle,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
man!"	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
prisoners	1
he	1
killed	1
in	1
Africa?	1
That	1
was	1
horrible!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
shrugging	1
her	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
low	1
fellow,	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will,"	1
remarked	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whom	1
to	1
answer,	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
smiled.	1
His	1
smile	1
was	1
unlike	1
the	1
half-smile	1
of	1
other	1
people.	1
When	1
he	1
smiled,	1
his	1
grave,	1
even	1
rather	1
gloomy,	1
look	1
was	1
instantaneously	1
replaced	1
by	1
another-	1
-a	1
childlike,	1
kindly,	1
even	1
rather	1
silly	1
look,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
ask	1
forgiveness.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
who	1
was	1
meeting	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
this	1
young	1
Jacobin	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
terrible	1
as	1
his	1
words	1
suggested.	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
him	1
to	1
answer	1
you	1
all	1
at	1
once?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Besides,	1
in	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
a	1
statesman	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
distinguish	1
between	1
his	1
acts	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
person,	1
as	1
a	1
general,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
emperor.	1
So	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course!"	1
Pierre	1
chimed	1
in,	1
pleased	1
at	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
this	1
reinforcement.	1
	1
"One	1
must	1
admit,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"that	1
Napoleon	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
great	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
Arcola,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
at	1
Jaffa	1
where	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
plague-stricken;	1
but...	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
acts	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
justify."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
wished	1
to	1
tone	1
down	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
remarks,	1
rose	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
started	1
up	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
everyone	1
to	1
attend,	1
and	1
asking	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
seated	1
began:	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
told	1
a	1
charming	1
Moscow	1
story	1
today	1
and	1
must	1
treat	1
you	1
to	1
it.	1
Excuse	1
me,	1
Vicomte--I	1
must	1
tell	1
it	1
in	1
Russian	1
or	1
the	1
point	1
will	1
be	1
lost...."	1
And	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
story	1
in	1
such	1
Russian	1
as	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
would	1
speak	1
after	1
spending	1
about	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
Russia.	1
Everyone	1
waited,	1
so	1
emphatically	1
and	1
eagerly	1
did	1
he	1
demand	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
story.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
in	1
Moscow	1
a	1
lady,	1
une	1
dame,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
stingy.	1
She	1
must	1
have	1
two	1
footmen	1
behind	1
her	1
carriage,	1
and	1
very	1
big	1
ones.	1
That	1
was	1
her	1
taste.	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
lady's	1
maid,	1
also	1
big.	1
She	1
said..."	1
	1
Here	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
paused,	1
evidently	1
collecting	1
his	1
ideas	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"She	1
said...	1
Oh	1
yes!	1
She	1
said,	1
'Girl,'	1
to	1
the	1
maid,	1
'put	1
on	1
a	1
livery,	1
get	1
up	1
behind	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
while	1
I	1
make	1
some	1
calls.'"	1
	1
Here	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
spluttered	1
and	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
long	1
before	1
his	1
audience,	1
which	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
unfavorable	1
to	1
the	1
narrator.	1
Several	1
persons,	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
did	1
however	1
smile.	1
	1
"She	1
went.	1
Suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
wind.	1
The	1
girl	1
lost	1
her	1
hat	1
and	1
her	1
long	1
hair	1
came	1
down...."	1
Here	1
he	1
could	1
contain	1
himself	1
no	1
longer	1
and	1
went	1
on,	1
between	1
gasps	1
of	1
laughter:	1
"And	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
knew...."	1
	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
anecdote	1
ended.	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
unintelligible	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
it,	1
or	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
Russian,	1
still	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
appreciated	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte's	1
social	1
tact	1
in	1
so	1
agreeably	1
ending	1
Pierre's	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
unamiable	1
outburst.	1
After	1
the	1
anecdote	1
the	1
conversation	1
broke	1
up	1
into	1
insignificant	1
small	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
next	1
balls,	1
about	1
theatricals,	1
and	1
who	1
would	1
meet	1
whom,	1
and	1
when	1
and	1
where.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Having	1
thanked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
for	1
her	1
charming	1
soiree,	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
leave.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
ungainly.	1
Stout,	1
about	1
the	1
average	1
height,	1
broad,	1
with	1
huge	1
red	1
hands;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
how	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
how	1
to	1
leave	1
one;	1
that	1
is,	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1
before	1
going	1
away.	1
Besides	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
absent-	1
minded.	1
When	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
go,	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
the	1
general's	1
three-cornered	1
hat,	1
and	1
held	1
it,	1
pulling	1
at	1
the	1
plume,	1
till	1
the	1
general	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
restore	1
it.	1
All	1
his	1
absent-mindedness	1
and	1
inability	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
room	1
and	1
converse	1
in	1
it	1
was,	1
however,	1
redeemed	1
by	1
his	1
kindly,	1
simple,	1
and	1
modest	1
expression.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
turned	1
toward	1
him	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
Christian	1
mildness	1
that	1
expressed	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
his	1
indiscretion,	1
nodded	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
again,	1
but	1
I	1
also	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
change	1
your	1
opinions,	1
my	1
dear	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre."	1
	1
When	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
and	1
only	1
bowed,	1
but	1
again	1
everybody	1
saw	1
his	1
smile,	1
which	1
said	1
nothing,	1
unless	1
perhaps,	1
"Opinions	1
are	1
opinions,	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
capital,	1
good-natured	1
fellow	1
I	1
am."	1
And	1
everyone,	1
including	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
felt	1
this.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
and,	1
turning	1
his	1
shoulders	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
was	1
helping	1
him	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
cloak,	1
listened	1
indifferently	1
to	1
his	1
wife's	1
chatter	1
with	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
stood	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
pretty,	1
pregnant	1
princess,	1
and	1
stared	1
fixedly	1
at	1
her	1
through	1
his	1
eyeglass.	1
	1
"Go	1
in,	1
Annette,	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
catch	1
cold,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
"It	1
is	1
settled,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
already	1
managed	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Lise	1
about	1
the	1
match	1
she	1
contemplated	1
between	1
Anatole	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
sister-in-law.	1
	1
"I	1
rely	1
on	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
tone.	1
"Write	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
how	1
her	1
father	1
looks	1
at	1
the	1
matter.	1
Au	1
revoir!"--	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
hall.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
approached	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and,	1
bending	1
his	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her,	1
began	1
to	1
whisper	1
something.	1
	1
Two	1
footmen,	1
the	1
princess'	1
and	1
his	1
own,	1
stood	1
holding	1
a	1
shawl	1
and	1
a	1
cloak,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
finish.	1
They	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
sentences	1
which	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
meaningless,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
understanding	1
but	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
The	1
princess	1
as	1
usual	1
spoke	1
smilingly	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
a	1
laugh.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador's,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
"-so	1
dull-.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
delightful	1
evening,	1
has	1
it	1
not?	1
Delightful!"	1
	1
"They	1
say	1
the	1
ball	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
good,"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess,	1
drawing	1
up	1
her	1
downy	1
little	1
lip.	1
"All	1
the	1
pretty	1
women	1
in	1
society	1
will	1
be	1
there."	1
	1
"Not	1
all,	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
there;	1
not	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
smiling	1
joyfully;	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
shawl	1
from	1
the	1
footman,	1
whom	1
he	1
even	1
pushed	1
aside,	1
he	1
began	1
wrapping	1
it	1
round	1
the	1
princess.	1
Either	1
from	1
awkwardness	1
or	1
intentionally	1
(no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
which)	1
after	1
the	1
shawl	1
had	1
been	1
adjusted	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
arm	1
around	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
as	1
though	1
embracing	1
her.	1
	1
Still	1
smiling,	1
she	1
gracefully	1
moved	1
away,	1
turning	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
husband.	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed,	1
so	1
weary	1
and	1
sleepy	1
did	1
he	1
seem.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
ready?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
wife,	1
looking	1
past	1
her.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
hurriedly	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
cloak,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion	1
reached	1
to	1
his	1
very	1
heels,	1
and,	1
stumbling	1
in	1
it,	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
following	1
the	1
princess,	1
whom	1
a	1
footman	1
was	1
helping	1
into	1
the	1
carriage.	1
	1
"Princesse,	1
au	1
revoir,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
stumbling	1
with	1
his	1
tongue	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
with	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
picking	1
up	1
her	1
dress,	1
was	1
taking	1
her	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
carriage,	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
adjusting	1
his	1
saber;	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
under	1
pretense	1
of	1
helping,	1
was	1
in	1
everyone's	1
way.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
Russian	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
disagreeable	1
tone	1
to	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
who	1
was	1
blocking	1
his	1
path.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
expecting	1
you,	1
Pierre,"	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
voice,	1
but	1
gently	1
and	1
affectionately.	1
	1
The	1
postilion	1
started,	1
the	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
rattled.	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
laughed	1
spasmodically	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
vicomte	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
home.	1
	1
"Well,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
having	1
seated	1
himself	1
beside	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
"your	1
little	1
princess	1
is	1
very	1
nice,	1
very	1
nice	1
indeed,	1
quite	1
French,"	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
fingers.	1
Hippolyte	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
terrible	1
chap	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
innocent	1
airs,"	1
continued	1
the	1
vicomte.	1
"I	1
pity	1
the	1
poor	1
husband,	1
that	1
little	1
officer	1
who	1
gives	1
himself	1
the	1
airs	1
of	1
a	1
monarch."	1
	1
Hippolyte	1
spluttered	1
again,	1
and	1
amid	1
his	1
laughter	1
said,	1
"And	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
ladies	1
are	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
French?	1
One	1
has	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
them."	1
	1
Pierre	1
reaching	1
the	1
house	1
first	1
went	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
study	1
like	1
one	1
quite	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
immediately	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
took	1
from	1
the	1
shelf	1
the	1
first	1
book	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hand	1
(it	1
was	1
Caesar's	1
Commentaries),	1
and	1
resting	1
on	1
his	1
elbow,	1
began	1
reading	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
Mlle	1
Scherer?	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
ill	1
now,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
study,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hands.	1
	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
his	1
whole	1
body,	1
making	1
the	1
sofa	1
creak.	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
eager	1
face	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"That	1
abbe	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
light....	1
In	1
my	1
opinion	1
perpetual	1
peace	1
is	1
possible	1
but--I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
express	1
it...	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
balance	1
of	1
political	1
power...."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
such	1
abstract	1
conversation.	1
	1
"One	1
can't	1
everywhere	1
say	1
all	1
one	1
thinks,	1
mon	1
cher.	1
Well,	1
have	1
you	1
at	1
last	1
decided	1
on	1
anything?	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
guardsman	1
or	1
a	1
diplomatist?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
after	1
a	1
momentary	1
silence.	1
	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
tucked	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
"Really,	1
I	1
don't	1
yet	1
know.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
either	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
must	1
decide	1
on	1
something!	1
Your	1
father	1
expects	1
it."	1
	1
Pierre	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
ten	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
abroad	1
with	1
an	1
abbe	1
as	1
tutor,	1
and	1
had	1
remained	1
away	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
twenty.	1
When	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow	1
his	1
father	1
dismissed	1
the	1
abbe	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
"Now	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
look	1
round,	1
and	1
choose	1
your	1
profession.	1
I	1
will	1
agree	1
to	1
anything.	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
money.	1
Write	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
you	1
in	1
everything."	1
Pierre	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
choosing	1
a	1
career	1
for	1
three	1
months,	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
decided	1
on	1
anything.	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
this	1
choice	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
speaking.	1
Pierre	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead.	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
Freemason,"	1
said	1
he,	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
abbe	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
that	1
evening.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
all	1
nonsense."	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
"let	1
us	1
talk	1
business.	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
not;	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
war	1
now	1
against	1
Napoleon.	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
war	1
for	1
freedom	1
I	1
could	1
understand	1
it	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
army;	1
but	1
to	1
help	1
England	1
and	1
Austria	1
against	1
the	1
greatest	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
not	1
right."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
only	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
childish	1
words.	1
He	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
finds	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
such	1
nonsense,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
in	1
fact	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
other	1
answer	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gave	1
to	1
this	1
naive	1
question.	1
	1
"If	1
no	1
one	1
fought	1
except	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
conviction,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wars,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
splendid,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
ironically.	1
	1
"Very	1
likely	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
splendid,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
never	1
come	1
about..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"What	1
for?	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
I	1
must.	1
Besides	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going..."	1
He	1
paused.	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
because	1
the	1
life	1
I	1
am	1
leading	1
here	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
me!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
The	1
rustle	1
of	1
a	1
woman's	1
dress	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shook	1
himself	1
as	1
if	1
waking	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
the	1
look	1
it	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
removed	1
his	1
feet	1
from	1
the	1
sofa.	1
The	1
princess	1
came	1
in.	1
She	1
had	1
changed	1
her	1
gown	1
for	1
a	1
house	1
dress	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
elegant	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rose	1
and	1
politely	1
placed	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
it,"	1
she	1
began,	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
French,	1
settling	1
down	1
briskly	1
and	1
fussily	1
in	1
the	1
easy	1
chair,	1
"how	1
is	1
it	1
Annette	1
never	1
got	1
married?	1
How	1
stupid	1
you	1
men	1
all	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
married	1
her!	1
Excuse	1
me	1
for	1
saying	1
so,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
sense	1
about	1
women.	1
What	1
an	1
argumentative	1
fellow	1
you	1
are,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre!"	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
arguing	1
with	1
your	1
husband.	1
I	1
can't	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
war,"	1
replied	1
Pierre,	1
addressing	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
embarrassment	1
so	1
commonly	1
shown	1
by	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
intercourse	1
with	1
young	1
women.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
started.	1
Evidently	1
Pierre's	1
words	1
touched	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
quick.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
tell	1
him!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it;	1
I	1
don't	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
understand	1
why	1
men	1
can't	1
live	1
without	1
wars.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
women	1
don't	1
want	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
don't	1
need	1
it?	1
Now	1
you	1
shall	1
judge	1
between	1
us.	1
I	1
always	1
tell	1
him:	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
Uncle's	1
aide-de-	1
camp,	1
a	1
most	1
brilliant	1
position.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
known,	1
so	1
much	1
appreciated	1
by	1
everyone.	1
The	1
other	1
day	1
at	1
the	1
Apraksins'	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
lady	1
asking,	1
'Is	1
that	1
the	1
famous	1
Prince	1
Andrew?'	1
I	1
did	1
indeed."	1
She	1
laughed.	1
"He	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
received	1
everywhere.	1
He	1
might	1
easily	1
become	1
aide-de-camp	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
Emperor	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
most	1
graciously.	1
Annette	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
it.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
and,	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
conversation,	1
gave	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"When	1
are	1
you	1
starting?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
going,	1
don't!	1
I	1
won't	1
hear	1
it	1
spoken	1
of,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
petulantly	1
playful	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
plainly	1
ill-suited	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
circle	1
of	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
member.	1
"Today	1
when	1
I	1
remembered	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
delightful	1
associations	1
must	1
be	1
broken	1
off...	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
know,	1
Andre..."	1
(she	1
looked	1
significantly	1
at	1
her	1
husband)	1
"I'm	1
afraid,	1
I'm	1
afraid!"	1
she	1
whispered,	1
and	1
a	1
shudder	1
ran	1
down	1
her	1
back.	1
	1
Her	1
husband	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
surprised	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
someone	1
besides	1
Pierre	1
and	1
himself	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
addressed	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
frigid	1
politeness.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
afraid	1
of,	1
Lise?	1
I	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"There,	1
what	1
egotists	1
men	1
all	1
are:	1
all,	1
all	1
egotists!	1
Just	1
for	1
a	1
whim	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
goodness	1
only	1
knows	1
why,	1
he	1
leaves	1
me	1
and	1
locks	1
me	1
up	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country."	1
	1
"With	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
sister,	1
remember,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gently.	1
	1
"Alone	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
without	1
my	1
friends....	1
And	1
he	1
expects	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
afraid."	1
	1
Her	1
tone	1
was	1
now	1
querulous	1
and	1
her	1
lip	1
drawn	1
up,	1
giving	1
her	1
not	1
a	1
joyful,	1
but	1
an	1
animal,	1
squirrel-like	1
expression.	1
She	1
paused	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
indecorous	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
pregnancy	1
before	1
Pierre,	1
though	1
the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
lay	1
in	1
that.	1
	1
"I	1
still	1
can't	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
afraid	1
of,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
slowly,	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
blushed,	1
and	1
raised	1
her	1
arms	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair.	1
	1
"No,	1
Andrew,	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
you	1
have	1
changed.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
you	1
have..."	1
	1
"Your	1
doctor	1
tells	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
earlier,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"You	1
had	1
better	1
go."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
her	1
short	1
downy	1
lip	1
quivered.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rose,	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
with	1
naive	1
surprise,	1
now	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
her,	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
rise	1
too,	1
but	1
changed	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
I	1
mind	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre	1
being	1
here?"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
suddenly,	1
her	1
pretty	1
face	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
distorted	1
by	1
a	1
tearful	1
grimace.	1
"I	1
have	1
long	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you,	1
Andrew,	1
why	1
you	1
have	1
changed	1
so	1
to	1
me?	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
you?	1
You	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
for	1
me.	1
Why	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Lise!"	1
was	1
all	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
said.	1
But	1
that	1
one	1
word	1
expressed	1
an	1
entreaty,	1
a	1
threat,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
conviction	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
regret	1
her	1
words.	1
But	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
hurriedly:	1
	1
"You	1
treat	1
me	1
like	1
an	1
invalid	1
or	1
a	1
child.	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
all!	1
Did	1
you	1
behave	1
like	1
that	1
six	1
months	1
ago?"	1
	1
"Lise,	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
desist,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
still	1
more	1
emphatically.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
agitated	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
rose	1
and	1
approached	1
the	1
princess.	1
He	1
seemed	1
unable	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
himself.	1
	1
"Calm	1
yourself,	1
Princess!	1
It	1
seems	1
so	1
to	1
you	1
because...	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
myself	1
have	1
experienced...	1
and	1
so...	1
because...	1
No,	1
excuse	1
me!	1
An	1
outsider	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
here...	1
No,	1
don't	1
distress	1
yourself...	1
Good-	1
bye!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
"No,	1
wait,	1
Pierre!	1
The	1
princess	1
is	1
too	1
kind	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
spending	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
thinks	1
only	1
of	1
himself,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
princess	1
without	1
restraining	1
her	1
angry	1
tears.	1
	1
"Lise!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
dryly,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
pitch	1
which	1
indicates	1
that	1
patience	1
is	1
exhausted.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
angry,	1
squirrel-like	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
princess'	1
pretty	1
face	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
winning	1
and	1
piteous	1
look	1
of	1
fear.	1
Her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
glanced	1
askance	1
at	1
her	1
husband's	1
face,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
assumed	1
the	1
timid,	1
deprecating	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
dog	1
when	1
it	1
rapidly	1
but	1
feebly	1
wags	1
its	1
drooping	1
tail.	1
	1
"Mon	1
Dieu,	1
mon	1
Dieu!"	1
she	1
muttered,	1
and	1
lifting	1
her	1
dress	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
forehead.	1
	1
"Good	1
night,	1
Lise,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
and	1
courteously	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
a	1
stranger.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
friends	1
were	1
silent.	1
Neither	1
cared	1
to	1
begin	1
talking.	1
Pierre	1
continually	1
glanced	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew;	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
hand.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
have	1
supper,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
elegant,	1
newly	1
decorated,	1
and	1
luxurious	1
dining	1
room.	1
Everything	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
napkins	1
to	1
the	1
silver,	1
china,	1
and	1
glass	1
bore	1
that	1
imprint	1
of	1
newness	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
households	1
of	1
the	1
newly	1
married.	1
Halfway	1
through	1
supper	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
nervous	1
agitation	1
such	1
as	1
Pierre	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
began	1
to	1
talk--as	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
long	1
had	1
something	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
suddenly	1
determines	1
to	1
speak	1
out.	1
	1
"Never,	1
never	1
marry,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!	1
That's	1
my	1
advice:	1
never	1
marry	1
till	1
you	1
can	1
say	1
to	1
yourself	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
you	1
are	1
capable	1
of,	1
and	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
your	1
choice	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
plainly	1
as	1
she	1
is,	1
or	1
else	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
cruel	1
and	1
irrevocable	1
mistake.	1
Marry	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
old	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
nothing--or	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
noble	1
in	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
lost.	1
It	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
wasted	1
on	1
trifles.	1
Yes!	1
Yes!	1
Yes!	1
Don't	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
such	1
surprise.	1
If	1
you	1
marry	1
expecting	1
anything	1
from	1
yourself	1
in	1
the	1
future,	1
you	1
will	1
feel	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
that	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
is	1
ended,	1
all	1
is	1
closed	1
except	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
ranged	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
court	1
lackey	1
and	1
an	1
idiot!...	1
But	1
what's	1
the	1
good?..."	1
and	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
which	1
made	1
his	1
face	1
seem	1
different	1
and	1
the	1
good-natured	1
expression	1
still	1
more	1
apparent,	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
in	1
amazement.	1
	1
"My	1
wife,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"is	1
an	1
excellent	1
woman,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
women	1
with	1
whom	1
a	1
man's	1
honor	1
is	1
safe;	1
but,	1
O	1
God,	1
what	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
give	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
unmarried!	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
mention	1
this,	1
because	1
I	1
like	1
you."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
ever	1
like	1
that	1
Bolkonski	1
who	1
had	1
lolled	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
easy	1
chairs	1
and	1
with	1
half-closed	1
eyes	1
had	1
uttered	1
French	1
phrases	1
between	1
his	1
teeth.	1
Every	1
muscle	1
of	1
his	1
thin	1
face	1
was	1
now	1
quivering	1
with	1
nervous	1
excitement;	1
his	1
eyes,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
seemed	1
extinguished,	1
now	1
flashed	1
with	1
brilliant	1
light.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
lifeless	1
he	1
seemed	1
at	1
ordinary	1
times,	1
the	1
more	1
impassioned	1
he	1
became	1
in	1
these	1
moments	1
of	1
almost	1
morbid	1
irritation.	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
understand	1
why	1
I	1
say	1
this,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
life.	1
You	1
talk	1
of	1
Bonaparte	1
and	1
his	1
career,"	1
said	1
he	1
(though	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
mentioned	1
Bonaparte),	1
"but	1
Bonaparte	1
when	1
he	1
worked	1
went	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
toward	1
his	1
goal.	1
He	1
was	1
free,	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
aim	1
to	1
consider,	1
and	1
he	1
reached	1
it.	1
But	1
tie	1
yourself	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
chained	1
convict,	1
you	1
lose	1
all	1
freedom!	1
And	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
strength	1
merely	1
weighs	1
you	1
down	1
and	1
torments	1
you	1
with	1
regret.	1
Drawing	1
rooms,	1
gossip,	1
balls,	1
vanity,	1
and	1
triviality--these	1
are	1
the	1
enchanted	1
circle	1
I	1
cannot	1
escape	1
from.	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
the	1
greatest	1
war	1
there	1
ever	1
was,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
and	1
am	1
fit	1
for	1
nothing.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
amiable	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
caustic	1
wit,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"and	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
they	1
listen	1
to	1
me.	1
And	1
that	1
stupid	1
set	1
without	1
whom	1
my	1
wife	1
cannot	1
exist,	1
and	1
those	1
women...	1
If	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
what	1
those	1
society	1
women	1
are,	1
and	1
women	1
in	1
general!	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
right.	1
Selfish,	1
vain,	1
stupid,	1
trivial	1
in	1
everything--that's	1
what	1
women	1
are	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
true	1
colors!	1
When	1
you	1
meet	1
them	1
in	1
society	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
in	1
them,	1
but	1
there's	1
nothing,	1
nothing,	1
nothing!	1
No,	1
don't	1
marry,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow;	1
don't	1
marry!"	1
concluded	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
funny	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
"that	1
you,	1
you	1
should	1
consider	1
yourself	1
incapable	1
and	1
your	1
life	1
a	1
spoiled	1
life.	1
You	1
have	1
everything	1
before	1
you,	1
everything.	1
And	1
you..."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
his	1
sentence,	1
but	1
his	1
tone	1
showed	1
how	1
highly	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
future.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
he	1
talk	1
like	1
that?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
considered	1
his	1
friend	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
perfection	1
because	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
possessed	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
just	1
the	1
very	1
qualities	1
Pierre	1
lacked,	1
and	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
best	1
described	1
as	1
strength	1
of	1
will.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
always	1
astonished	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
calm	1
manner	1
of	1
treating	1
everybody,	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
memory,	1
his	1
extensive	1
reading	1
(he	1
had	1
read	1
everything,	1
knew	1
everything,	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
opinion	1
about	1
everything),	1
but	1
above	1
all	1
at	1
his	1
capacity	1
for	1
work	1
and	1
study.	1
And	1
if	1
Pierre	1
was	1
often	1
struck	1
by	1
Andrew's	1
lack	1
of	1
capacity	1
for	1
philosophical	1
meditation	1
(to	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
particularly	1
addicted),	1
he	1
regarded	1
even	1
this	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
defect	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
strength.	1
	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
best,	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
simplest	1
relations	1
of	1
life,	1
praise	1
and	1
commendation	1
are	1
essential,	1
just	1
as	1
grease	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
wheels	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
run	1
smoothly.	1
	1
"My	1
part	1
is	1
played	1
out,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"What's	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking	1
about	1
me?	1
Let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
you,"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
silence,	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
reassuring	1
thoughts.	1
	1
That	1
smile	1
was	1
immediately	1
reflected	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
face.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
me?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
his	1
face	1
relaxing	1
into	1
a	1
careless,	1
merry	1
smile.	1
"What	1
am	1
I?	1
An	1
illegitimate	1
son!"	1
He	1
suddenly	1
blushed	1
crimson,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
to	1
say	1
this.	1
"Without	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
without	1
means...	1
And	1
it	1
really..."	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
"it	1
really"	1
was.	1
"For	1
the	1
present	1
I	1
am	1
free	1
and	1
am	1
all	1
right.	1
Only	1
I	1
haven't	1
the	1
least	1
idea	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
do;	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
seriously."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
kindly	1
at	1
him,	1
yet	1
his	1
glance--friendly	1
and	1
affectionate	1
as	1
it	1
was--expressed	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
superiority.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
you,	1
especially	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
one	1
live	1
man	1
among	1
our	1
whole	1
set.	1
Yes,	1
you're	1
all	1
right!	1
Choose	1
what	1
you	1
will;	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
You'll	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
anywhere.	1
But	1
look	1
here:	1
give	1
up	1
visiting	1
those	1
Kuragins	1
and	1
leading	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
life.	1
It	1
suits	1
you	1
so	1
badly--all	1
this	1
debauchery,	1
dissipation,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
you	1
have,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow?"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"Women,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow;	1
women!"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Women	1
who	1
are	1
comme	1
il	1
faut,	1
that's	1
a	1
different	1
matter;	1
but	1
the	1
Kuragins'	1
set	1
of	1
women,	1
'women	1
and	1
wine'	1
I	1
don't	1
understand!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
staying	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Kuragin's	1
and	1
sharing	1
the	1
dissipated	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
Anatole,	1
the	1
son	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
planning	1
to	1
reform	1
by	1
marrying	1
him	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
sister.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
as	1
if	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
happy	1
thought,	1
"seriously,	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
it....	1
Leading	1
such	1
a	1
life	1
I	1
can't	1
decide	1
or	1
think	1
properly	1
about	1
anything.	1
One's	1
head	1
aches,	1
and	1
one	1
spends	1
all	1
one's	1
money.	1
He	1
asked	1
me	1
for	1
tonight,	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
go."	1
	1
"You	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
not	1
to	1
go?"	1
	1
"On	1
my	1
honor!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
It	1
was	1
past	1
one	1
o'clock	1
when	1
Pierre	1
left	1
his	1
friend.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cloudless,	1
northern,	1
summer	1
night.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
an	1
open	1
cab	1
intending	1
to	1
drive	1
straight	1
home.	1
But	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
drew	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
sleep	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
night.	1
It	1
was	1
light	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
deserted	1
street	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
more	1
like	1
morning	1
or	1
evening	1
than	1
night.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
that	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
was	1
expecting	1
the	1
usual	1
set	1
for	1
cards	1
that	1
evening,	1
after	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
generally	1
a	1
drinking	1
bout,	1
finishing	1
with	1
visits	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
Pierre	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Kuragin's,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
immediately	1
recalled	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
there.	1
Then,	1
as	1
happens	1
to	1
people	1
of	1
weak	1
character,	1
he	1
desired	1
so	1
passionately	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
enjoy	1
that	1
dissipation	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
accustomed	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
go.	1
The	1
thought	1
immediately	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
account,	1
because	1
before	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
promised	1
Prince	1
Anatole	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
gathering;	1
"besides,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"all	1
such	1
'words	1
of	1
honor'	1
are	1
conventional	1
things	1
with	1
no	1
definite	1
meaning,	1
especially	1
if	1
one	1
considers	1
that	1
by	1
tomorrow	1
one	1
may	1
be	1
dead,	1
or	1
something	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
honor	1
and	1
dishonor	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
same!"	1
Pierre	1
often	1
indulged	1
in	1
reflections	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
nullifying	1
all	1
his	1
decisions	1
and	1
intentions.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
Kuragin's.	1
	1
Reaching	1
the	1
large	1
house	1
near	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards'	1
barracks,	1
in	1
which	1
Anatole	1
lived,	1
Pierre	1
entered	1
the	1
lighted	1
porch,	1
ascended	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
door.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom;	1
empty	1
bottles,	1
cloaks,	1
and	1
overshoes	1
were	1
lying	1
about;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
alcohol,	1
and	1
sounds	1
of	1
voices	1
and	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
	1
Cards	1
and	1
supper	1
were	1
over,	1
but	1
the	1
visitors	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed.	1
Pierre	1
threw	1
off	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
first	1
room,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
supper.	1
A	1
footman,	1
thinking	1
no	1
one	1
saw	1
him,	1
was	1
drinking	1
on	1
the	1
sly	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
glasses.	1
From	1
the	1
third	1
room	1
came	1
sounds	1
of	1
laughter,	1
the	1
shouting	1
of	1
familiar	1
voices,	1
the	1
growling	1
of	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
general	1
commotion.	1
Some	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
young	1
men	1
were	1
crowding	1
anxiously	1
round	1
an	1
open	1
window.	1
Three	1
others	1
were	1
romping	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
bear,	1
one	1
pulling	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
chain	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
"I	1
bet	1
a	1
hundred	1
on	1
Stevens!"	1
shouted	1
one.	1
	1
"Mind,	1
no	1
holding	1
on!"	1
cried	1
another.	1
	1
"I	1
bet	1
on	1
Dolokhov!"	1
cried	1
a	1
third.	1
"Kuragin,	1
you	1
part	1
our	1
hands."	1
	1
"There,	1
leave	1
Bruin	1
alone;	1
here's	1
a	1
bet	1
on."	1
	1
"At	1
one	1
draught,	1
or	1
he	1
loses!"	1
shouted	1
a	1
fourth.	1
	1
"Jacob,	1
bring	1
a	1
bottle!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
host,	1
a	1
tall,	1
handsome	1
fellow	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
group,	1
without	1
a	1
coat,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
fine	1
linen	1
shirt	1
unfastened	1
in	1
front.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
you	1
fellows....	1
Here	1
is	1
Petya!	1
Good	1
man!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
addressing	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Another	1
voice,	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
with	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
particularly	1
striking	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
drunken	1
voices	1
by	1
its	1
sober	1
ring,	1
cried	1
from	1
the	1
window:	1
"Come	1
here;	1
part	1
the	1
bets!"	1
This	1
was	1
Dolokhov,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment,	1
a	1
notorious	1
gambler	1
and	1
duelist,	1
who	1
was	1
living	1
with	1
Anatole.	1
Pierre	1
smiled,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
merrily.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
What's	1
it	1
all	1
about?"	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
drunk	1
yet!	1
A	1
bottle	1
here,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
taking	1
a	1
glass	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"First	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
must	1
drink!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
drank	1
one	1
glass	1
after	1
another,	1
looking	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
at	1
the	1
tipsy	1
guests	1
who	1
were	1
again	1
crowding	1
round	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
their	1
chatter.	1
Anatole	1
kept	1
on	1
refilling	1
Pierre's	1
glass	1
while	1
explaining	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
betting	1
with	1
Stevens,	1
an	1
English	1
naval	1
officer,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
drink	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
ledge	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
floor	1
window	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
hanging	1
out.	1
	1
"Go	1
on,	1
you	1
must	1
drink	1
it	1
all,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
giving	1
Pierre	1
the	1
last	1
glass,	1
"or	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
you	1
go!"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
won't,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
pushing	1
Anatole	1
aside,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
holding	1
the	1
Englishman's	1
hand	1
and	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly	1
repeating	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
bet,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
particularly	1
to	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
of	1
medium	1
height,	1
with	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
light-blue	1
eyes.	1
He	1
was	1
about	1
twenty-five.	1
Like	1
all	1
infantry	1
officers	1
he	1
wore	1
no	1
mustache,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
mouth,	1
the	1
most	1
striking	1
feature	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
was	1
clearly	1
seen.	1
The	1
lines	1
of	1
that	1
mouth	1
were	1
remarkably	1
finely	1
curved.	1
The	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
lip	1
formed	1
a	1
sharp	1
wedge	1
and	1
closed	1
firmly	1
on	1
the	1
firm	1
lower	1
one,	1
and	1
something	1
like	1
two	1
distinct	1
smiles	1
played	1
continually	1
round	1
the	1
two	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
mouth;	1
this,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
resolute,	1
insolent	1
intelligence	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
his	1
face.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
small	1
means	1
and	1
no	1
connections.	1
Yet,	1
though	1
Anatole	1
spent	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
rubles,	1
Dolokhov	1
lived	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
placed	1
himself	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
footing	1
that	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
them,	1
including	1
Anatole	1
himself,	1
respected	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
did	1
Anatole.	1
Dolokhov	1
could	1
play	1
all	1
games	1
and	1
nearly	1
always	1
won.	1
However	1
much	1
he	1
drank,	1
he	1
never	1
lost	1
his	1
clearheadedness.	1
Both	1
Kuragin	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
notorious	1
among	1
the	1
rakes	1
and	1
scapegraces	1
of	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
The	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
was	1
brought.	1
The	1
window	1
frame	1
which	1
prevented	1
anyone	1
from	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
sill	1
was	1
being	1
forced	1
out	1
by	1
two	1
footmen,	1
who	1
were	1
evidently	1
flurried	1
and	1
intimidated	1
by	1
the	1
directions	1
and	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
around.	1
	1
Anatole	1
with	1
his	1
swaggering	1
air	1
strode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
smash	1
something.	1
Pushing	1
away	1
the	1
footmen	1
he	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
frame,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
move	1
it.	1
He	1
smashed	1
a	1
pane.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
try,	1
Hercules,"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Pierre	1
seized	1
the	1
crossbeam,	1
tugged,	1
and	1
wrenched	1
the	1
oak	1
frame	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
crash.	1
	1
"Take	1
it	1
right	1
out,	1
or	1
they'll	1
think	1
I'm	1
holding	1
on,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
Englishman	1
bragging?...	1
Eh?	1
Is	1
it	1
all	1
right?"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
	1
"First-rate,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
at	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
with	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
window,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sky,	1
the	1
dawn	1
merging	1
with	1
the	1
afterglow	1
of	1
sunset,	1
was	1
visible.	1
	1
Dolokhov,	1
the	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
jumped	1
onto	1
the	1
window	1
sill.	1
"Listen!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
standing	1
there	1
and	1
addressing	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"I	1
bet	1
fifty	1
imperials"--he	1
spoke	1
French	1
that	1
the	1
Englishman	1
might	1
understand	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
it	1
very	1
well--"I	1
bet	1
fifty	1
imperials...	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
hundred?"	1
added	1
he,	1
addressing	1
the	1
Englishman.	1
	1
"No,	1
fifty,"	1
replied	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
"All	1
right.	1
Fifty	1
imperials...	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
drink	1
a	1
whole	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
without	1
taking	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
mouth,	1
sitting	1
outside	1
the	1
window	1
on	1
this	1
spot"	1
(he	1
stooped	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
sloping	1
ledge	1
outside	1
the	1
window)	1
"and	1
without	1
holding	1
on	1
to	1
anything.	1
Is	1
that	1
right?"	1
	1
"Quite	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman.	1
	1
Anatole	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Englishman	1
and	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
him--the	1
Englishman	1
was	1
short--began	1
repeating	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
wager	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
English.	1
	1
"Wait!"	1
cried	1
Dolokhov,	1
hammering	1
with	1
the	1
bottle	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill	1
to	1
attract	1
attention.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
Kuragin.	1
Listen!	1
If	1
anyone	1
else	1
does	1
the	1
same,	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
him	1
a	1
hundred	1
imperials.	1
Do	1
you	1
understand?"	1
	1
The	1
Englishman	1
nodded,	1
but	1
gave	1
no	1
indication	1
whether	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
accept	1
this	1
challenge	1
or	1
not.	1
Anatole	1
did	1
not	1
release	1
him,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
kept	1
nodding	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
understood,	1
Anatole	1
went	1
on	1
translating	1
Dolokhov's	1
words	1
into	1
English.	1
A	1
thin	1
young	1
lad,	1
an	1
hussar	1
of	1
the	1
Life	1
Guards,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
losing	1
that	1
evening,	1
climbed	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
leaned	1
over,	1
and	1
looked	1
down.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
looking	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
pavement.	1
	1
"Shut	1
up!"	1
cried	1
Dolokhov,	1
pushing	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
window.	1
The	1
lad	1
jumped	1
awkwardly	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
tripping	1
over	1
his	1
spurs.	1
	1
Placing	1
the	1
bottle	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
reach	1
it	1
easily,	1
Dolokhov	1
climbed	1
carefully	1
and	1
slowly	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
lowered	1
his	1
legs.	1
Pressing	1
against	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
he	1
adjusted	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
seat,	1
lowered	1
his	1
hands,	1
moved	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
bottle.	1
Anatole	1
brought	1
two	1
candles	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
quite	1
light.	1
Dolokhov's	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
shirt,	1
and	1
his	1
curly	1
head,	1
were	1
lit	1
up	1
from	1
both	1
sides.	1
Everyone	1
crowded	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
the	1
Englishman	1
in	1
front.	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
smiling	1
but	1
silent.	1
One	1
man,	1
older	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
present,	1
suddenly	1
pushed	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
and	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
seize	1
hold	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
shirt.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
this	1
is	1
folly!	1
He'll	1
be	1
killed,"	1
said	1
this	1
more	1
sensible	1
man.	1
	1
Anatole	1
stopped	1
him.	1
	1
"Don't	1
touch	1
him!	1
You'll	1
startle	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
he'll	1
be	1
killed.	1
Eh?...	1
What	1
then?...	1
Eh?"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
turned	1
round	1
and,	1
again	1
holding	1
on	1
with	1
both	1
hands,	1
arranged	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
seat.	1
	1
"If	1
anyone	1
comes	1
meddling	1
again,"	1
said	1
he,	1
emitting	1
the	1
words	1
separately	1
through	1
his	1
thin	1
compressed	1
lips,	1
"I	1
will	1
throw	1
him	1
down	1
there.	1
Now	1
then!"	1
	1
Saying	1
this	1
he	1
again	1
turned	1
round,	1
dropped	1
his	1
hands,	1
took	1
the	1
bottle	1
and	1
lifted	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
free	1
hand	1
to	1
balance	1
himself.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
footmen	1
who	1
had	1
stooped	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
some	1
broken	1
glass	1
remained	1
in	1
that	1
position	1
without	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
from	1
Dolokhov's	1
back.	1
Anatole	1
stood	1
erect	1
with	1
staring	1
eyes.	1
The	1
Englishman	1
looked	1
on	1
sideways,	1
pursing	1
up	1
his	1
lips.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
wished	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
affair	1
ran	1
to	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall.	1
Pierre	1
hid	1
his	1
face,	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
forgot	1
to	1
fade	1
though	1
his	1
features	1
now	1
expressed	1
horror	1
and	1
fear.	1
All	1
were	1
still.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Dolokhov	1
still	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position,	1
only	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
thrown	1
further	1
back	1
till	1
his	1
curly	1
hair	1
touched	1
his	1
shirt	1
collar,	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
holding	1
the	1
bottle	1
was	1
lifted	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
and	1
trembled	1
with	1
the	1
effort.	1
The	1
bottle	1
was	1
emptying	1
perceptibly	1
and	1
rising	1
still	1
higher	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
tilting	1
yet	1
further	1
back.	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
so	1
long?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
had	1
elapsed.	1
Suddenly	1
Dolokhov	1
made	1
a	1
backward	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
spine,	1
and	1
his	1
arm	1
trembled	1
nervously;	1
this	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
cause	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
to	1
slip	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
sloping	1
ledge.	1
As	1
he	1
began	1
slipping	1
down,	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
arm	1
wavered	1
still	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
strain.	1
One	1
hand	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
clutch	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
but	1
refrained	1
from	1
touching	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
again	1
covered	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
open	1
them	1
again.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
a	1
stir	1
all	1
around.	1
He	1
looked	1
up:	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
but	1
radiant	1
face.	1
	1
"It's	1
empty."	1
	1
He	1
threw	1
the	1
bottle	1
to	1
the	1
Englishman,	1
who	1
caught	1
it	1
neatly.	1
Dolokhov	1
jumped	1
down.	1
He	1
smelt	1
strongly	1
of	1
rum.	1
	1
"Well	1
done!...	1
Fine	1
fellow!...	1
There's	1
a	1
bet	1
for	1
you!...	1
Devil	1
take	1
you!"	1
came	1
from	1
different	1
sides.	1
	1
The	1
Englishman	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
began	1
counting	1
out	1
the	1
money.	1
Dolokhov	1
stood	1
frowning	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
speak.	1
Pierre	1
jumped	1
upon	1
the	1
window	1
sill.	1
	1
"Gentlemen,	1
who	1
wishes	1
to	1
bet	1
with	1
me?	1
I'll	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
thing!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
cried.	1
"Even	1
without	1
a	1
bet,	1
there!	1
Tell	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
me	1
a	1
bottle.	1
I'll	1
do	1
it....	1
Bring	1
a	1
bottle!"	1
	1
"Let	1
him	1
do	1
it,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"What	1
next?	1
Have	1
you	1
gone	1
mad?...	1
No	1
one	1
would	1
let	1
you!...	1
Why,	1
you	1
go	1
giddy	1
even	1
on	1
a	1
staircase,"	1
exclaimed	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"I'll	1
drink	1
it!	1
Let's	1
have	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum!"	1
shouted	1
Pierre,	1
banging	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
determined	1
and	1
drunken	1
gesture	1
and	1
preparing	1
to	1
climb	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
They	1
seized	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
arms;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
everyone	1
who	1
touched	1
him	1
was	1
sent	1
flying.	1
	1
"No,	1
you'll	1
never	1
manage	1
him	1
that	1
way,"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
I'll	1
get	1
round	1
him....	1
Listen!	1
I'll	1
take	1
your	1
bet	1
tomorrow,	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
going	1
to	1
----'s."	1
	1
"Come	1
on	1
then,"	1
cried	1
Pierre.	1
"Come	1
on!...	1
And	1
we'll	1
take	1
Bruin	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
bear,	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
lifted	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
began	1
dancing	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
kept	1
the	1
promise	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
her	1
only	1
son	1
Boris	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
soiree.	1
The	1
matter	1
was	1
mentioned	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
an	1
exception	1
made,	1
and	1
Boris	1
transferred	1
into	1
the	1
regiment	1
of	1
Semenov	1
Guards	1
with	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
cornet.	1
He	1
received,	1
however,	1
no	1
appointment	1
to	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff	1
despite	1
all	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
endeavors	1
and	1
entreaties.	1
Soon	1
after	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
rich	1
relations,	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
stayed	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
where	1
her	1
darling	1
Bory,	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
entered	1
a	1
regiment	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
was	1
being	1
at	1
once	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards	1
as	1
a	1
cornet,	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
from	1
childhood	1
and	1
lived	1
for	1
years	1
at	1
a	1
time.	1
The	1
Guards	1
had	1
already	1
left	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
August,	1
and	1
her	1
son,	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
his	1
equipment,	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
to	1
Radzivilov.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
St.	1
Natalia's	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
day	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs--the	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
youngest	1
daughter--both	1
named	1
Nataly.	1
Ever	1
since	1
the	1
morning,	1
carriages	1
with	1
six	1
horses	1
had	1
been	1
coming	1
and	1
going	1
continually,	1
bringing	1
visitors	1
to	1
the	1
Countess	1
Rostova's	1
big	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Povarskaya,	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
countess	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
handsome	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
with	1
the	1
visitors	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
congratulate,	1
and	1
who	1
constantly	1
succeeded	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
relays.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
about	1
forty-five,	1
with	1
a	1
thin	1
Oriental	1
type	1
of	1
face,	1
evidently	1
worn	1
out	1
with	1
childbearing--she	1
had	1
had	1
twelve.	1
A	1
languor	1
of	1
motion	1
and	1
speech,	1
resulting	1
from	1
weakness,	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
distinguished	1
air	1
which	1
inspired	1
respect.	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
Drubetskaya,	1
who	1
as	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
was	1
also	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
helped	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
entertain	1
the	1
visitors.	1
The	1
young	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms,	1
not	1
considering	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
receiving	1
the	1
visitors.	1
The	1
count	1
met	1
the	1
guests	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
off,	1
inviting	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very,	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
or	1
"ma	1
chere"--he	1
called	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
variation	1
in	1
his	1
tone,	1
"my	1
dear,"	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
above	1
or	1
below	1
him	1
in	1
rank--"I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
for	1
our	1
two	1
dear	1
ones	1
whose	1
name	1
day	1
we	1
are	1
keeping.	1
But	1
mind	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
or	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
offended,	1
ma	1
chere!	1
On	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
come,	1
mon	1
cher!"	1
These	1
words	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception	1
or	1
variation,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
full,	1
cheerful,	1
clean-shaven	1
face,	1
the	1
same	1
firm	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
quick,	1
repeated	1
bows.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
visitor	1
off	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
drew	1
a	1
chair	1
toward	1
him	1
or	1
her,	1
and	1
jauntily	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
enjoys	1
life	1
and	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
live,	1
he	1
swayed	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
with	1
dignity,	1
offered	1
surmises	1
about	1
the	1
weather,	1
or	1
touched	1
on	1
questions	1
of	1
health,	1
sometimes	1
in	1
Russian	1
and	1
sometimes	1
in	1
very	1
bad	1
but	1
self-confident	1
French;	1
then	1
again,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
weary	1
but	1
unflinching	1
in	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
duty,	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
see	1
some	1
visitors	1
off	1
and,	1
stroking	1
his	1
scanty	1
gray	1
hairs	1
over	1
his	1
bald	1
patch,	1
also	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
dinner.	1
Sometimes	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
anteroom	1
he	1
would	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
conservatory	1
and	1
pantry	1
into	1
the	1
large	1
marble	1
dining	1
hall,	1
where	1
tables	1
were	1
being	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
eighty	1
people;	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
footmen,	1
who	1
were	1
bringing	1
in	1
silver	1
and	1
china,	1
moving	1
tables,	1
and	1
unfolding	1
damask	1
table	1
linen,	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
Dmitri	1
Vasilevich,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
and	1
the	1
manager	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
affairs,	1
and	1
while	1
looking	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
enormous	1
table	1
would	1
say:	1
"Well,	1
Dmitri,	1
you'll	1
see	1
that	1
things	1
are	1
all	1
as	1
they	1
should	1
be?	1
That's	1
right!	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
serving,	1
that's	1
it."	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
complacent	1
sigh	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"Marya	1
Lvovna	1
Karagina	1
and	1
her	1
daughter!"	1
announced	1
the	1
countess'	1
gigantic	1
footman	1
in	1
his	1
bass	1
voice,	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
countess	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
pinch	1
from	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
her	1
husband's	1
portrait	1
on	1
it.	1
	1
"I'm	1
quite	1
worn	1
out	1
by	1
these	1
callers.	1
However,	1
I'll	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
no	1
more.	1
She	1
is	1
so	1
affected.	1
Ask	1
her	1
in,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
in	1
a	1
sad	1
voice,	1
as	1
if	1
saying:	1
"Very	1
well,	1
finish	1
me	1
off."	1
	1
A	1
tall,	1
stout,	1
and	1
proud-looking	1
woman,	1
with	1
a	1
round-faced	1
smiling	1
daughter,	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
their	1
dresses	1
rustling.	1
	1
"Dear	1
Countess,	1
what	1
an	1
age...	1
She	1
has	1
been	1
laid	1
up,	1
poor	1
child...	1
at	1
the	1
Razumovski's	1
ball...	1
and	1
Countess	1
Apraksina...	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
delighted..."	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
animated	1
feminine	1
voices,	1
interrupting	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
dresses	1
and	1
the	1
scraping	1
of	1
chairs.	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
conversations	1
began	1
which	1
last	1
out	1
until,	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
pause,	1
the	1
guests	1
rise	1
with	1
a	1
rustle	1
of	1
dresses	1
and	1
say,	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
delighted...	1
Mamma's	1
health...	1
and	1
Countess	1
Apraksina..."	1
and	1
then,	1
again	1
rustling,	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
put	1
on	1
cloaks	1
or	1
mantles,	1
and	1
drive	1
away.	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
chief	1
topic	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
the	1
illness	1
of	1
the	1
wealthy	1
and	1
celebrated	1
beau	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
day,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
about	1
his	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
Pierre,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
behaved	1
so	1
improperly	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
count,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"He	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
bad	1
health,	1
and	1
now	1
this	1
vexation	1
about	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
kill	1
him!"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
that?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
visitor	1
alluded	1
to,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
about	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
distress	1
some	1
fifteen	1
times.	1
	1
"That's	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
a	1
modern	1
education,"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"It	1
seems	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
abroad	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
liked,	1
now	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
hear	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
doing	1
such	1
terrible	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
expelled	1
by	1
the	1
police."	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
say	1
so!"	1
replied	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"He	1
chose	1
his	1
friends	1
badly,"	1
interposed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son,	1
he,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
Dolokhov	1
have,	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
what!	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
it.	1
Dolokhov	1
has	1
been	1
degraded	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
Bezukhov's	1
son	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin's	1
father	1
managed	1
somehow	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
son's	1
affair	1
hushed	1
up,	1
but	1
even	1
he	1
was	1
ordered	1
out	1
of	1
Petersburg."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
up	1
to?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
regular	1
brigands,	1
especially	1
Dolokhov,"	1
replied	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Marya	1
Ivanovna	1
Dolokhova,	1
such	1
a	1
worthy	1
woman,	1
but	1
there,	1
just	1
fancy!	1
Those	1
three	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
bear	1
somewhere,	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
carriage,	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
visit	1
some	1
actresses!	1
The	1
police	1
tried	1
to	1
interfere,	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
do?	1
They	1
tied	1
a	1
policeman	1
and	1
the	1
bear	1
back	1
to	1
back	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
bear	1
into	1
the	1
Moyka	1
Canal.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
bear	1
swimming	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
policeman	1
on	1
his	1
back!"	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
nice	1
figure	1
the	1
policeman	1
must	1
have	1
cut,	1
my	1
dear!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
count,	1
dying	1
with	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
dreadful!	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
laugh	1
at	1
it,	1
Count?"	1
	1
Yet	1
the	1
ladies	1
themselves	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
rescue	1
the	1
poor	1
man,"	1
continued	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"And	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov's	1
son	1
who	1
amuses	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
sensible	1
manner!	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
well	1
educated	1
and	1
clever.	1
This	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
foreign	1
education	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
him!	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
receive	1
him,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
money.	1
They	1
wanted	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
quite	1
declined:	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
daughters	1
to	1
consider."	1
	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
so	1
rich?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess,	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
girls,	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
assumed	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
inattention.	1
"His	1
children	1
are	1
all	1
illegitimate.	1
I	1
think	1
Pierre	1
also	1
is	1
illegitimate."	1
	1
The	1
visitor	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
with	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
think	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
intervened	1
in	1
the	1
conversation,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
connections	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
"The	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is,"	1
said	1
she	1
significantly,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper,	1
"everyone	1
knows	1
Count	1
Cyril's	1
reputation....	1
He	1
has	1
lost	1
count	1
of	1
his	1
children,	1
but	1
this	1
Pierre	1
was	1
his	1
favorite."	1
	1
"How	1
handsome	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
still	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
year	1
ago!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
countess.	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
handsomer	1
man."	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
altered	1
now,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Well,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
saying,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
is	1
the	1
next	1
heir	1
through	1
his	1
wife,	1
but	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
Pierre,	1
looked	1
after	1
his	1
education,	1
and	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
about	1
him;	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
his	1
death--and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
die	1
at	1
any	1
moment,	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Lorrain	1
has	1
come	1
from	1
Petersburg-	1
-no	1
one	1
knows	1
who	1
will	1
inherit	1
his	1
immense	1
fortune,	1
Pierre	1
or	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
Forty	1
thousand	1
serfs	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
rubles!	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
told	1
me	1
himself.	1
Besides,	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
is	1
my	1
mother's	1
second	1
cousin.	1
He's	1
also	1
my	1
Bory's	1
godfather,"	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
attached	1
no	1
importance	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
fact.	1
	1
"Prince	1
Vasili	1
arrived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
yesterday.	1
I	1
hear	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
on	1
some	1
inspection	1
business,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
between	1
ourselves,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
"that	1
is	1
a	1
pretext.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich,	1
hearing	1
how	1
ill	1
he	1
is."	1
	1
"But	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
my	1
dear,	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
capital	1
joke,"	1
said	1
the	1
count;	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
elder	1
visitor	1
was	1
not	1
listening,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies.	1
"I	1
can	1
just	1
imagine	1
what	1
a	1
funny	1
figure	1
that	1
policeman	1
cut!"	1
	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arms	1
to	1
impersonate	1
the	1
policeman,	1
his	1
portly	1
form	1
again	1
shook	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
ringing	1
laugh,	1
the	1
laugh	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
always	1
eats	1
well	1
and,	1
in	1
particular,	1
drinks	1
well.	1
"So	1
do	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
us!"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Silence	1
ensued.	1
The	1
countess	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
callers,	1
smiling	1
affably,	1
but	1
not	1
concealing	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
distressed	1
if	1
they	1
now	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
leave.	1
The	1
visitor's	1
daughter	1
was	1
already	1
smoothing	1
down	1
her	1
dress	1
with	1
an	1
inquiring	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
mother,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
were	1
heard	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
running	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
falling	1
over,	1
and	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
thirteen,	1
hiding	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
short	1
muslin	1
frock,	1
darted	1
in	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
intended	1
her	1
flight	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
so	1
far.	1
Behind	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
appeared	1
a	1
student	1
with	1
a	1
crimson	1
coat	1
collar,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards,	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
fifteen,	1
and	1
a	1
plump	1
rosy-faced	1
boy	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
jacket.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
jumped	1
up	1
and,	1
swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
spread	1
his	1
arms	1
wide	1
and	1
threw	1
them	1
round	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
in.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
here	1
she	1
is!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
laughing.	1
"My	1
pet,	1
whose	1
name	1
day	1
it	1
is.	1
My	1
dear	1
pet!"	1
	1
"Ma	1
chere,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
everything,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
feigned	1
severity.	1
"You	1
spoil	1
her,	1
Ilya,"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
my	1
dear?	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
many	1
happy	1
returns	1
of	1
your	1
name	1
day,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"What	1
a	1
charming	1
child,"	1
she	1
added,	1
addressing	1
the	1
mother.	1
	1
This	1
black-eyed,	1
wide-mouthed	1
girl,	1
not	1
pretty	1
but	1
full	1
of	1
life--with	1
childish	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
which	1
after	1
her	1
run	1
heaved	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
bodice,	1
with	1
black	1
curls	1
tossed	1
backward,	1
thin	1
bare	1
arms,	1
little	1
legs	1
in	1
lace-	1
frilled	1
drawers,	1
and	1
feet	1
in	1
low	1
slippers--was	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
charming	1
age	1
when	1
a	1
girl	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
child,	1
though	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
a	1
young	1
woman.	1
Escaping	1
from	1
her	1
father	1
she	1
ran	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
flushed	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
lace	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
mantilla--not	1
paying	1
the	1
least	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
severe	1
remark--and	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
She	1
laughed,	1
and	1
in	1
fragmentary	1
sentences	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
about	1
a	1
doll	1
which	1
she	1
produced	1
from	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
frock.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
see?...	1
My	1
doll...	1
Mimi...	1
You	1
see..."	1
was	1
all	1
Natasha	1
managed	1
to	1
utter	1
(to	1
her	1
everything	1
seemed	1
funny).	1
She	1
leaned	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
loud,	1
ringing	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
prim	1
visitor	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
joining	1
in.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
monstrosity	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother,	1
pushing	1
away	1
her	1
daughter	1
with	1
pretended	1
sternness,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
visitor	1
she	1
added:	1
"She	1
is	1
my	1
youngest	1
girl."	1
	1
Natasha,	1
raising	1
her	1
face	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
from	1
her	1
mother's	1
mantilla,	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
her	1
through	1
tears	1
of	1
laughter,	1
and	1
again	1
hid	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
The	1
visitor,	1
compelled	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
at	1
this	1
family	1
scene,	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
part	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
"is	1
Mimi	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
yours?	1
A	1
daughter,	1
I	1
suppose?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
visitor's	1
tone	1
of	1
condescension	1
to	1
childish	1
things.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
seriously.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
younger	1
generation:	1
Boris,	1
the	1
officer,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
son;	1
Nicholas,	1
the	1
undergraduate,	1
the	1
count's	1
eldest	1
son;	1
Sonya,	1
the	1
count's	1
fifteen-year-old	1
niece,	1
and	1
little	1
Petya,	1
his	1
youngest	1
boy,	1
had	1
all	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
were	1
obviously	1
trying	1
to	1
restrain	1
within	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
decorum	1
the	1
excitement	1
and	1
mirth	1
that	1
shone	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
faces.	1
Evidently	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
rooms,	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
dashed	1
out	1
so	1
impetuously,	1
the	1
conversation	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
amusing	1
than	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
talk	1
of	1
society	1
scandals,	1
the	1
weather,	1
and	1
Countess	1
Apraksina.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
glanced	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
suppress	1
their	1
laughter.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
young	1
men,	1
the	1
student	1
and	1
the	1
officer,	1
friends	1
from	1
childhood,	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
and	1
both	1
handsome	1
fellows,	1
though	1
not	1
alike.	1
Boris	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
fair,	1
and	1
his	1
calm	1
and	1
handsome	1
face	1
had	1
regular,	1
delicate	1
features.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
short	1
with	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
an	1
open	1
expression.	1
Dark	1
hairs	1
were	1
already	1
showing	1
on	1
his	1
upper	1
lip,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
expressed	1
impetuosity	1
and	1
enthusiasm.	1
Nicholas	1
blushed	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
He	1
evidently	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
say,	1
but	1
failed.	1
Boris	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
at	1
once	1
found	1
his	1
footing,	1
and	1
related	1
quietly	1
and	1
humorously	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
doll	1
Mimi	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
quite	1
a	1
young	1
lady,	1
before	1
her	1
nose	1
was	1
broken;	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
aged	1
during	1
the	1
five	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her,	1
and	1
how	1
her	1
head	1
had	1
cracked	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
skull.	1
Having	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
younger	1
brother,	1
who	1
was	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
shaking	1
with	1
suppressed	1
laughter,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
control	1
herself	1
any	1
longer,	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
her	1
nimble	1
little	1
feet	1
would	1
carry	1
her.	1
Boris	1
did	1
not	1
laugh.	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
out,	1
weren't	1
you,	1
Mamma?	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
the	1
carriage?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
mother	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
ready,"	1
she	1
answered,	1
returning	1
his	1
smile.	1
	1
Boris	1
quietly	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
Natasha.	1
The	1
plump	1
boy	1
ran	1
after	1
them	1
angrily,	1
as	1
if	1
vexed	1
that	1
their	1
program	1
had	1
been	1
disturbed.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
The	1
only	1
young	1
people	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
not	1
counting	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
visitor	1
and	1
the	1
countess'	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
(who	1
was	1
four	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
behaved	1
already	1
like	1
a	1
grown-up	1
person),	1
were	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
the	1
niece.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
a	1
slender	1
little	1
brunette	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
veiled	1
by	1
long	1
lashes,	1
thick	1
black	1
plaits	1
coiling	1
twice	1
round	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
tawny	1
tint	1
in	1
her	1
complexion	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
color	1
of	1
her	1
slender	1
but	1
graceful	1
and	1
muscular	1
arms	1
and	1
neck.	1
By	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
her	1
movements,	1
by	1
the	1
softness	1
and	1
flexibility	1
of	1
her	1
small	1
limbs,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
certain	1
coyness	1
and	1
reserve	1
of	1
manner,	1
she	1
reminded	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
pretty,	1
half-grown	1
kitten	1
which	1
promises	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
beautiful	1
little	1
cat.	1
She	1
evidently	1
considered	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
show	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
by	1
smiling,	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself	1
her	1
eyes	1
under	1
their	1
thick	1
long	1
lashes	1
watched	1
her	1
cousin	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army,	1
with	1
such	1
passionate	1
girlish	1
adoration	1
that	1
her	1
smile	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
impose	1
upon	1
anyone,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
kitten	1
had	1
settled	1
down	1
only	1
to	1
spring	1
up	1
with	1
more	1
energy	1
and	1
again	1
play	1
with	1
her	1
cousin	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
too	1
could,	1
like	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Boris,	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"Ah	1
yes,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
addressing	1
the	1
visitor	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
Nicholas,	1
"his	1
friend	1
Boris	1
has	1
become	1
an	1
officer,	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
friendship's	1
sake	1
he	1
is	1
leaving	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
me,	1
his	1
old	1
father,	1
and	1
entering	1
the	1
military	1
service,	1
my	1
dear.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
and	1
everything	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Archives	1
Department!	1
Isn't	1
that	1
friendship?"	1
remarked	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
an	1
inquiring	1
tone.	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
war	1
has	1
been	1
declared,"	1
replied	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"They've	1
been	1
saying	1
so	1
a	1
long	1
while,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
"and	1
they'll	1
say	1
so	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
My	1
dear,	1
there's	1
friendship	1
for	1
you,"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
"He's	1
joining	1
the	1
hussars."	1
	1
The	1
visitor,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say,	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
from	1
friendship,"	1
declared	1
Nicholas,	1
flaring	1
up	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
shameful	1
aspersion.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
from	1
friendship	1
at	1
all;	1
I	1
simply	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
is	1
my	1
vocation."	1
	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
cousin	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
visitor;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
regarding	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
approbation.	1
	1
"Schubert,	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
Hussars,	1
is	1
dining	1
with	1
us	1
today.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
on	1
leave	1
and	1
is	1
taking	1
Nicholas	1
back	1
with	1
him.	1
It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
speaking	1
playfully	1
of	1
a	1
matter	1
that	1
evidently	1
distressed	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
you,	1
Papa,"	1
said	1
his	1
son,	1
"that	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
go,	1
I'll	1
stay.	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
use	1
anywhere	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
army;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
diplomat	1
or	1
a	1
government	1
clerk.--I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
hide	1
what	1
I	1
feel."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
kept	1
glancing	1
with	1
the	1
flirtatiousness	1
of	1
a	1
handsome	1
youth	1
at	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
visitor.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
kitten,	1
feasting	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
him,	1
seemed	1
ready	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
to	1
start	1
her	1
gambols	1
again	1
and	1
display	1
her	1
kittenish	1
nature.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count.	1
"He	1
always	1
flares	1
up!	1
This	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
turned	1
all	1
their	1
heads;	1
they	1
all	1
think	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
an	1
ensign	1
and	1
became	1
Emperor.	1
Well,	1
well,	1
God	1
grant	1
it,"	1
he	1
added,	1
not	1
noticing	1
his	1
visitor's	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
elders	1
began	1
talking	1
about	1
Bonaparte.	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
turned	1
to	1
young	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
weren't	1
at	1
the	1
Arkharovs'	1
on	1
Thursday.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
dull	1
without	1
you,"	1
said	1
she,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
tender	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man,	1
flattered,	1
sat	1
down	1
nearer	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
coquettish	1
smile,	1
and	1
engaged	1
the	1
smiling	1
Julie	1
in	1
a	1
confidential	1
conversation	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
noticing	1
that	1
his	1
involuntary	1
smile	1
had	1
stabbed	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
who	1
blushed	1
and	1
smiled	1
unnaturally.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
talk	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
passionately	1
angry	1
glance,	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
maintain	1
the	1
artificial	1
smile	1
on	1
her	1
lips,	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
All	1
Nicholas'	1
animation	1
vanished.	1
He	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
pause	1
in	1
the	1
conversation,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
distressed	1
face	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
find	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"How	1
plainly	1
all	1
these	1
young	1
people	1
wear	1
their	1
hearts	1
on	1
their	1
sleeves!"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out.	1
"Cousinage--	1
dangereux	1
voisinage;"	1
*	1
she	1
added.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Cousinhood	1
is	1
a	1
dangerous	1
neighborhood.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
when	1
the	1
brightness	1
these	1
young	1
people	1
had	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
vanished;	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
answering	1
a	1
question	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
put	1
but	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
her	1
mind,	1
"and	1
how	1
much	1
suffering,	1
how	1
much	1
anxiety	1
one	1
has	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
rejoice	1
in	1
them	1
now!	1
And	1
yet	1
really	1
the	1
anxiety	1
is	1
greater	1
now	1
than	1
the	1
joy.	1
One	1
is	1
always,	1
always	1
anxious!	1
Especially	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
age,	1
so	1
dangerous	1
both	1
for	1
girls	1
and	1
boys."	1
	1
"It	1
all	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
bringing	1
up,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you're	1
quite	1
right,"	1
continued	1
the	1
countess.	1
"Till	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
always,	1
thank	1
God,	1
been	1
my	1
children's	1
friend	1
and	1
had	1
their	1
full	1
confidence,"	1
said	1
she,	1
repeating	1
the	1
mistake	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
parents	1
who	1
imagine	1
that	1
their	1
children	1
have	1
no	1
secrets	1
from	1
them.	1
"I	1
know	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
my	1
daughters'	1
first	1
confidante,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
Nicholas,	1
with	1
his	1
impulsive	1
nature,	1
does	1
get	1
into	1
mischief	1
(a	1
boy	1
can't	1
help	1
it),	1
he	1
will	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
never	1
be	1
like	1
those	1
Petersburg	1
young	1
men."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
are	1
splendid,	1
splendid	1
youngsters,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
always	1
solved	1
questions	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
perplexing	1
by	1
deciding	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
splendid.	1
"Just	1
fancy:	1
wants	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
hussar.	1
What's	1
one	1
to	1
do,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
charming	1
creature	1
your	1
younger	1
girl	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor;	1
"a	1
little	1
volcano!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
regular	1
volcano,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"Takes	1
after	1
me!	1
And	1
what	1
a	1
voice	1
she	1
has;	1
though	1
she's	1
my	1
daughter,	1
I	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
she'll	1
be	1
a	1
singer,	1
a	1
second	1
Salomoni!	1
We	1
have	1
engaged	1
an	1
Italian	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
lessons."	1
	1
"Isn't	1
she	1
too	1
young?	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
harms	1
the	1
voice	1
to	1
train	1
it	1
at	1
that	1
age."	1
	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
too	1
young!"	1
replied	1
the	1
count.	1
"Why,	1
our	1
mothers	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
at	1
twelve	1
or	1
thirteen."	1
	1
"And	1
she's	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Boris	1
already.	1
Just	1
fancy!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
smile,	1
looking	1
at	1
Boris	1
and	1
went	1
on,	1
evidently	1
concerned	1
with	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
always	1
occupied	1
her:	1
"Now	1
you	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
severe	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
forbid	1
it...	1
goodness	1
knows	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
up	1
to	1
on	1
the	1
sly"	1
(she	1
meant	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
kissing),	1
"but	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
know	1
every	1
word	1
she	1
utters.	1
She	1
will	1
come	1
running	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
accord	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
everything.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
spoil	1
her,	1
but	1
really	1
that	1
seems	1
the	1
best	1
plan.	1
With	1
her	1
elder	1
sister	1
I	1
was	1
stricter."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
quite	1
differently,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
handsome	1
elder	1
daughter,	1
Countess	1
Vera,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
smile	1
did	1
not	1
enhance	1
Vera's	1
beauty	1
as	1
smiles	1
generally	1
do;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
unnatural,	1
and	1
therefore	1
unpleasant,	1
expression.	1
Vera	1
was	1
good-looking,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
stupid,	1
quick	1
at	1
learning,	1
was	1
well-brought	1
up,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
voice;	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
true	1
and	1
appropriate,	1
yet,	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
everyone--the	1
visitors	1
and	1
countess	1
alike--turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
wondering	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
awkward.	1
	1
"People	1
are	1
always	1
too	1
clever	1
with	1
their	1
eldest	1
children	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
something	1
exceptional	1
of	1
them,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
denying	1
it,	1
my	1
dear?	1
Our	1
dear	1
countess	1
was	1
too	1
clever	1
with	1
Vera,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
that?	1
She's	1
turned	1
out	1
splendidly	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
he	1
added,	1
winking	1
at	1
Vera.	1
	1
The	1
guests	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
leave,	1
promising	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
"What	1
manners!	1
I	1
thought	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
go,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
guests	1
out.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
When	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
only	1
went	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
conservatory.	1
There	1
she	1
paused	1
and	1
stood	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
waiting	1
for	1
Boris	1
to	1
come	1
out.	1
She	1
was	1
already	1
growing	1
impatient,	1
and	1
stamped	1
her	1
foot,	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
at	1
his	1
not	1
coming	1
at	1
once,	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
discreet	1
steps	1
approaching	1
neither	1
quickly	1
nor	1
slowly.	1
At	1
this	1
Natasha	1
dashed	1
swiftly	1
among	1
the	1
flower	1
tubs	1
and	1
hid	1
there.	1
	1
Boris	1
paused	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
looked	1
round,	1
brushed	1
a	1
little	1
dust	1
from	1
the	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
uniform,	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
mirror	1
examined	1
his	1
handsome	1
face.	1
Natasha,	1
very	1
still,	1
peered	1
out	1
from	1
her	1
ambush,	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do.	1
He	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
before	1
the	1
glass,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
walked	1
toward	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
but	1
changed	1
her	1
mind.	1
"Let	1
him	1
look	1
for	1
me,"	1
thought	1
she.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Boris	1
gone	1
than	1
Sonya,	1
flushed,	1
in	1
tears,	1
and	1
muttering	1
angrily,	1
came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
Natasha	1
checked	1
her	1
first	1
impulse	1
to	1
run	1
out	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
her	1
hiding	1
place,	1
watching--as	1
under	1
an	1
invisible	1
cap--to	1
see	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
She	1
was	1
experiencing	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
peculiar	1
pleasure.	1
Sonya,	1
muttering	1
to	1
herself,	1
kept	1
looking	1
round	1
toward	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door.	1
It	1
opened	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
How	1
can	1
you?"	1
said	1
he,	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"It's	1
nothing,	1
nothing;	1
leave	1
me	1
alone!"	1
sobbed	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
"Well,	1
if	1
you	1
do,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better,	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
her!"	1
	1
"So-o-onya!	1
Look	1
here!	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
torture	1
me	1
and	1
yourself	1
like	1
that,	1
for	1
a	1
mere	1
fancy?"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
taking	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
Sonya	1
did	1
not	1
pull	1
it	1
away,	1
and	1
left	1
off	1
crying.	1
Natasha,	1
not	1
stirring	1
and	1
scarcely	1
breathing,	1
watched	1
from	1
her	1
ambush	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes.	1
"What	1
will	1
happen	1
now?"	1
thought	1
she.	1
	1
"Sonya!	1
What	1
is	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
me?	1
You	1
alone	1
are	1
everything!"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"And	1
I	1
will	1
prove	1
it	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
I	1
won't;	1
only	1
forgive	1
me,	1
Sonya!"	1
He	1
drew	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
nice,"	1
thought	1
Natasha;	1
and	1
when	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
conservatory	1
she	1
followed	1
and	1
called	1
Boris	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Boris,	1
come	1
here,"	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
a	1
sly	1
and	1
significant	1
look.	1
"I	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
Here,	1
here!"	1
and	1
she	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
conservatory	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
among	1
the	1
tubs	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
hiding.	1
	1
Boris	1
followed	1
her,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
something?"	1
asked	1
he.	1
	1
She	1
grew	1
confused,	1
glanced	1
round,	1
and,	1
seeing	1
the	1
doll	1
she	1
had	1
thrown	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tubs,	1
picked	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
"Kiss	1
the	1
doll,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Boris	1
looked	1
attentively	1
and	1
kindly	1
at	1
her	1
eager	1
face,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"Don't	1
you	1
want	1
to?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
come	1
here,"	1
said	1
she,	1
and	1
went	1
further	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
plants	1
and	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
doll.	1
"Closer,	1
closer!"	1
she	1
whispered.	1
	1
She	1
caught	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
by	1
his	1
cuffs,	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
solemnity	1
and	1
fear	1
appeared	1
on	1
her	1
flushed	1
face.	1
	1
"And	1
me?	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
kiss	1
me?"	1
she	1
whispered	1
almost	1
inaudibly,	1
glancing	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows,	1
smiling,	1
and	1
almost	1
crying	1
from	1
excitement.	1
	1
Boris	1
blushed.	1
	1
"How	1
funny	1
you	1
are!"	1
he	1
said,	1
bending	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
blushing	1
still	1
more,	1
but	1
he	1
waited	1
and	1
did	1
nothing.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
onto	1
a	1
tub	1
to	1
be	1
higher	1
than	1
he,	1
embraced	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
both	1
her	1
slender	1
bare	1
arms	1
clasped	1
him	1
above	1
his	1
neck,	1
and,	1
tossing	1
back	1
her	1
hair,	1
kissed	1
him	1
full	1
on	1
the	1
lips.	1
	1
Then	1
she	1
slipped	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
flowerpots	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tubs	1
and	1
stood,	1
hanging	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"Natasha,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
but..."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me?"	1
Natasha	1
broke	1
in.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am,	1
but	1
please	1
don't	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
like	1
that....	1
In	1
another	1
four	1
years...	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
for	1
your	1
hand."	1
	1
Natasha	1
considered.	1
	1
"Thirteen,	1
fourteen,	1
fifteen,	1
sixteen,"	1
she	1
counted	1
on	1
her	1
slender	1
little	1
fingers.	1
"All	1
right!	1
Then	1
it's	1
settled?"	1
	1
A	1
smile	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
eager	1
face.	1
	1
"Settled!"	1
replied	1
Boris.	1
	1
"Forever?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl.	1
"Till	1
death	1
itself?"	1
	1
She	1
took	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
face	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
adjoining	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
After	1
receiving	1
her	1
visitors,	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
she	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
admit	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
the	1
porter	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
invite	1
to	1
dinner	1
all	1
who	1
came	1
"to	1
congratulate."	1
The	1
countess	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
tête-à-tête	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
her	1
childhood,	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
properly	1
since	1
she	1
returned	1
from	1
Petersburg.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
her	1
tear-worn	1
but	1
pleasant	1
face,	1
drew	1
her	1
chair	1
nearer	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"With	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
frank,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"There	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
left	1
of	1
us	1
old	1
friends!	1
That's	1
why	1
I	1
so	1
value	1
your	1
friendship."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
looked	1
at	1
Vera	1
and	1
paused.	1
The	1
countess	1
pressed	1
her	1
friend's	1
hand.	1
	1
"Vera,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
not	1
a	1
favorite,	1
"how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
little	1
tact?	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
wanted	1
here?	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
girls,	1
or..."	1
	1
The	1
handsome	1
Vera	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
at	1
all	1
hurt.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
sooner,	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
gone,"	1
she	1
replied	1
as	1
she	1
rose	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room.	1
	1
But	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
she	1
noticed	1
two	1
couples	1
sitting,	1
one	1
pair	1
at	1
each	1
window.	1
She	1
stopped	1
and	1
smiled	1
scornfully.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
sitting	1
close	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
who	1
was	1
copying	1
out	1
some	1
verses	1
for	1
her,	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
written.	1
Boris	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
window	1
and	1
ceased	1
talking	1
when	1
Vera	1
entered.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
Vera	1
with	1
guilty,	1
happy	1
faces.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
pleasant	1
and	1
touching	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
little	1
girls	1
in	1
love;	1
but	1
apparently	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
them	1
roused	1
no	1
pleasant	1
feeling	1
in	1
Vera.	1
	1
"How	1
often	1
have	1
I	1
asked	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
things?"	1
she	1
said.	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
room	1
of	1
your	1
own,"	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
inkstand	1
from	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
minute,	1
in	1
a	1
minute,"	1
he	1
said,	1
dipping	1
his	1
pen.	1
	1
"You	1
always	1
manage	1
to	1
do	1
things	1
at	1
the	1
wrong	1
time,"	1
continued	1
Vera.	1
"You	1
came	1
rushing	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
so	1
that	1
everyone	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you."	1
	1
Though	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
quite	1
just,	1
perhaps	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
no	1
one	1
replied,	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
simply	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
She	1
lingered	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
inkstand	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"And	1
at	1
your	1
age	1
what	1
secrets	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
between	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Boris,	1
or	1
between	1
you	1
two?	1
It's	1
all	1
nonsense!"	1
	1
"Now,	1
Vera,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
you?"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
in	1
defense,	1
speaking	1
very	1
gently.	1
	1
She	1
seemed	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
kind	1
and	1
affectionate	1
to	1
everyone.	1
	1
"Very	1
silly,"	1
said	1
Vera.	1
"I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you.	1
Secrets	1
indeed!"	1
	1
"All	1
have	1
secrets	1
of	1
their	1
own,"	1
answered	1
Natasha,	1
getting	1
warmer.	1
"We	1
don't	1
interfere	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
Berg."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
think	1
not,"	1
said	1
Vera,	1
"because	1
there	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
anything	1
wrong	1
in	1
my	1
behavior.	1
But	1
I'll	1
just	1
tell	1
Mamma	1
how	1
you	1
are	1
behaving	1
with	1
Boris."	1
	1
"Natalya	1
Ilynichna	1
behaves	1
very	1
well	1
to	1
me,"	1
remarked	1
Boris.	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
complain	1
of."	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Boris!	1
You	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
diplomat	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
tiresome,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
in	1
a	1
mortified	1
voice	1
that	1
trembled	1
slightly.	1
(She	1
used	1
the	1
word	1
"diplomat,"	1
which	1
was	1
just	1
then	1
much	1
in	1
vogue	1
among	1
the	1
children,	1
in	1
the	1
special	1
sense	1
they	1
attached	1
to	1
it.)	1
"Why	1
does	1
she	1
bother	1
me?"	1
And	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Vera,	1
"You'll	1
never	1
understand	1
it,	1
because	1
you've	1
never	1
loved	1
anyone.	1
You	1
have	1
no	1
heart!	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
Madame	1
de	1
Genlis	1
and	1
nothing	1
more"	1
(this	1
nickname,	1
bestowed	1
on	1
Vera	1
by	1
Nicholas,	1
was	1
considered	1
very	1
stinging),	1
"and	1
your	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
people!	1
Go	1
and	1
flirt	1
with	1
Berg	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
please,"	1
she	1
finished	1
quickly.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
not	1
run	1
after	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
before	1
visitors..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
you've	1
done	1
what	1
you	1
wanted,"	1
put	1
in	1
Nicholas--"said	1
unpleasant	1
things	1
to	1
everyone	1
and	1
upset	1
them.	1
Let's	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
nursery."	1
	1
All	1
four,	1
like	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
scared	1
birds,	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"The	1
unpleasant	1
things	1
were	1
said	1
to	1
me,"	1
remarked	1
Vera,	1
"I	1
said	1
none	1
to	1
anyone."	1
	1
"Madame	1
de	1
Genlis!	1
Madame	1
de	1
Genlis!"	1
shouted	1
laughing	1
voices	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
The	1
handsome	1
Vera,	1
who	1
produced	1
such	1
an	1
irritating	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
effect	1
on	1
everyone,	1
smiled	1
and,	1
evidently	1
unmoved	1
by	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
arranged	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
scarf.	1
Looking	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
handsome	1
face	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
become	1
still	1
colder	1
and	1
calmer.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
still	1
going	1
on.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
"my	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
roses	1
either.	1
Don't	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
we	1
are	1
living	1
our	1
means	1
won't	1
last	1
long?	1
It's	1
all	1
the	1
Club	1
and	1
his	1
easygoing	1
nature.	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
do	1
we	1
get	1
any	1
rest?	1
Theatricals,	1
hunting,	1
and	1
heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
besides!	1
But	1
don't	1
let's	1
talk	1
about	1
me;	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
managed	1
everything.	1
I	1
often	1
wonder	1
at	1
you,	1
Annette--how	1
at	1
your	1
age	1
you	1
can	1
rush	1
off	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
to	1
those	1
ministers	1
and	1
great	1
people,	1
and	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
them	1
all!	1
It's	1
quite	1
astonishing.	1
How	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
things	1
settled?	1
I	1
couldn't	1
possibly	1
do	1
it."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
love,"	1
answered	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
"God	1
grant	1
you	1
never	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
a	1
widow	1
without	1
means	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
son	1
you	1
love	1
to	1
distraction!	1
One	1
learns	1
many	1
things	1
then,"	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
pride.	1
"That	1
lawsuit	1
taught	1
me	1
much.	1
When	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
big	1
people	1
I	1
write	1
a	1
note:	1
'Princess	1
So-and-So	1
desires	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
So	1
and-So,'	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
take	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
go	1
myself	1
two,	1
three,	1
or	1
four	1
times--	1
till	1
I	1
get	1
what	1
I	1
want.	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
what	1
they	1
think	1
of	1
me."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
apply	1
about	1
Bory?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
"You	1
see	1
yours	1
is	1
already	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
Guards,	1
while	1
my	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
going	1
as	1
a	1
cadet.	1
There's	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
interest	1
himself	1
for	1
him.	1
To	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
apply?"	1
	1
"To	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
kind.	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
agreed	1
to	1
everything,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
enthusiastically,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
all	1
the	1
humiliation	1
she	1
had	1
endured	1
to	1
gain	1
her	1
end.	1
	1
"Has	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
aged	1
much?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
we	1
acted	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
Rumyantsovs'	1
theatricals.	1
I	1
expect	1
he	1
has	1
forgotten	1
me.	1
He	1
paid	1
me	1
attentions	1
in	1
those	1
days,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
ever,"	1
replied	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
"overflowing	1
with	1
amiability.	1
His	1
position	1
has	1
not	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
'I	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
so	1
little	1
for	1
you,	1
dear	1
Princess.	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
your	1
command.'	1
Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
relation.	1
But,	1
Nataly,	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
my	1
son:	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
his	1
happiness!	1
And	1
my	1
affairs	1
are	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
bad	1
way	1
that	1
my	1
position	1
is	1
now	1
a	1
terrible	1
one,"	1
continued	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
sadly,	1
dropping	1
her	1
voice.	1
"My	1
wretched	1
lawsuit	1
takes	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
and	1
makes	1
no	1
progress.	1
Would	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
I	1
have	1
literally	1
not	1
a	1
penny	1
and	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
equip	1
Boris."	1
She	1
took	1
out	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
"I	1
need	1
five	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
and	1
have	1
only	1
one	1
twenty-five-ruble	1
note.	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state....	1
My	1
only	1
hope	1
now	1
is	1
in	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov.	1
If	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
assist	1
his	1
godson--you	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
Bory's	1
godfather--and	1
allow	1
him	1
something	1
for	1
his	1
maintenance,	1
all	1
my	1
trouble	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
thrown	1
away....	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
equip	1
him."	1
	1
The	1
countess'	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
and	1
she	1
pondered	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"I	1
often	1
think,	1
though,	1
perhaps	1
it's	1
a	1
sin,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
"that	1
here	1
lives	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov	1
so	1
rich,	1
all	1
alone...	1
that	1
tremendous	1
fortune...	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
life	1
worth?	1
It's	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
Bory's	1
life	1
is	1
only	1
just	1
beginning...."	1
	1
"Surely	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
something	1
to	1
Boris,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Heaven	1
only	1
knows,	1
my	1
dear!	1
These	1
rich	1
grandees	1
are	1
so	1
selfish.	1
Still,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
Boris	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
straight	1
out.	1
Let	1
people	1
think	1
what	1
they	1
will	1
of	1
me,	1
it's	1
really	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
my	1
son's	1
fate	1
is	1
at	1
stake."	1
The	1
princess	1
rose.	1
"It's	1
now	1
two	1
o'clock	1
and	1
you	1
dine	1
at	1
four.	1
There	1
will	1
just	1
be	1
time."	1
	1
And	1
like	1
a	1
practical	1
Petersburg	1
lady	1
who	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
time,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
sent	1
someone	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
who	1
saw	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
should	1
not	1
hear,	1
"Wish	1
me	1
good	1
luck."	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
coming	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
dining	1
hall	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
and	1
he	1
added:	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
better,	1
ask	1
Pierre	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
us.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
danced	1
with	1
the	1
children.	1
Be	1
sure	1
to	1
invite	1
him,	1
my	1
dear.	1
We	1
will	1
see	1
how	1
Taras	1
distinguishes	1
himself	1
today.	1
He	1
says	1
Count	1
Orlov	1
never	1
gave	1
such	1
a	1
dinner	1
as	1
ours	1
will	1
be!"	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Boris,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
as	1
Countess	1
Rostova's	1
carriage	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
seated	1
drove	1
over	1
the	1
straw	1
covered	1
street	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
wide	1
courtyard	1
of	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov's	1
house.	1
"My	1
dear	1
Boris,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother,	1
drawing	1
her	1
hand	1
from	1
beneath	1
her	1
old	1
mantle	1
and	1
laying	1
it	1
timidly	1
and	1
tenderly	1
on	1
her	1
son's	1
arm,	1
"be	1
affectionate	1
and	1
attentive	1
to	1
him.	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
is	1
your	1
godfather	1
after	1
all,	1
your	1
future	1
depends	1
on	1
him.	1
Remember	1
that,	1
my	1
dear,	1
and	1
be	1
nice	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
you	1
so	1
well	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
be."	1
	1
"If	1
only	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
anything	1
besides	1
humiliation	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it..."	1
answered	1
her	1
son	1
coldly.	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
your	1
sake."	1
	1
Although	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
saw	1
someone's	1
carriage	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance,	1
after	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
son	1
(who	1
without	1
asking	1
to	1
be	1
announced	1
had	1
passed	1
straight	1
through	1
the	1
glass	1
porch	1
between	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
statues	1
in	1
niches)	1
and	1
looking	1
significantly	1
at	1
the	1
lady's	1
old	1
cloak,	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
they	1
wanted	1
the	1
count	1
or	1
the	1
princesses,	1
and,	1
hearing	1
that	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count,	1
said	1
his	1
excellency	1
was	1
worse	1
today,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
excellency	1
was	1
not	1
receiving	1
anyone.	1
	1
"We	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
back,"	1
said	1
the	1
son	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"My	1
dear!"	1
exclaimed	1
his	1
mother	1
imploringly,	1
again	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
touch	1
might	1
soothe	1
or	1
rouse	1
him.	1
	1
Boris	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
mother	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cloak.	1
	1
"My	1
friend,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
in	1
gentle	1
tones,	1
addressing	1
the	1
hall	1
porter,	1
"I	1
know	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
is	1
very	1
ill...	1
that's	1
why	1
I	1
have	1
come...	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
relation.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
disturb	1
him,	1
my	1
friend...	1
I	1
only	1
need	1
see	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Sergeevich:	1
he	1
is	1
staying	1
here,	1
is	1
he	1
not?	1
Please	1
announce	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
hall	1
porter	1
sullenly	1
pulled	1
a	1
bell	1
that	1
rang	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
"Princess	1
Drubetskaya	1
to	1
see	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Sergeevich,"	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
a	1
footman	1
dressed	1
in	1
knee	1
breeches,	1
shoes,	1
and	1
a	1
swallow-tail	1
coat,	1
who	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
and	1
looked	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
halfway	1
landing.	1
	1
The	1
mother	1
smoothed	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dyed	1
silk	1
dress	1
before	1
a	1
large	1
Venetian	1
mirror	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
trodden-down	1
shoes	1
briskly	1
ascended	1
the	1
carpeted	1
stairs.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
son,	1
once	1
more	1
stimulating	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
touch,	1
"you	1
promised	1
me!"	1
	1
The	1
son,	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes,	1
followed	1
her	1
quietly.	1
	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
large	1
hall,	1
from	1
which	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
apartments	1
assigned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
son,	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
an	1
elderly	1
footman	1
who	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
as	1
they	1
entered,	1
the	1
bronze	1
handle	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
turned	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
came	1
out--wearing	1
a	1
velvet	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
star	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
custom	1
when	1
at	1
home--taking	1
leave	1
of	1
a	1
good-looking,	1
dark-haired	1
man.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Petersburg	1
doctor,	1
Lorrain.	1
	1
"Then	1
it	1
is	1
certain?"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"Prince,	1
humanum	1
est	1
errare,	1
*	1
but..."	1
replied	1
the	1
doctor,	1
swallowing	1
his	1
r's,	1
and	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
Latin	1
words	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
accent.	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
err	1
is	1
human.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
very	1
well..."	1
	1
Seeing	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
and	1
her	1
son,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
dismissed	1
the	1
doctor	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
approached	1
them	1
silently	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
inquiry.	1
The	1
son	1
noticed	1
that	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
profound	1
sorrow	1
suddenly	1
clouded	1
his	1
mother's	1
face,	1
and	1
he	1
smiled	1
slightly.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Prince!	1
In	1
what	1
sad	1
circumstances	1
we	1
meet	1
again!	1
And	1
how	1
is	1
our	1
dear	1
invalid?"	1
said	1
she,	1
as	1
though	1
unaware	1
of	1
the	1
cold	1
offensive	1
look	1
fixed	1
on	1
her.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
stared	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
Boris	1
questioningly	1
and	1
perplexed.	1
Boris	1
bowed	1
politely.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
without	1
acknowledging	1
the	1
bow	1
turned	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
answering	1
her	1
query	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
lips	1
indicating	1
very	1
little	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
patient.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible?"	1
exclaimed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
awful!	1
It	1
is	1
terrible	1
to	1
think....	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
son,"	1
she	1
added,	1
indicating	1
Boris.	1
"He	1
wanted	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
himself."	1
	1
Boris	1
bowed	1
again	1
politely.	1
	1
"Believe	1
me,	1
Prince,	1
a	1
mother's	1
heart	1
will	1
never	1
forget	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
us."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
a	1
service,	1
my	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
arranging	1
his	1
lace	1
frill,	1
and	1
in	1
tone	1
and	1
manner,	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
under	1
an	1
obligation,	1
assuming	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
much	1
greater	1
importance	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
at	1
Anna	1
Scherer's	1
reception.	1
	1
"Try	1
to	1
serve	1
well	1
and	1
show	1
yourself	1
worthy,"	1
added	1
he,	1
addressing	1
Boris	1
with	1
severity.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad....	1
Are	1
you	1
here	1
on	1
leave?"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
tone	1
of	1
indifference.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
awaiting	1
orders	1
to	1
join	1
my	1
new	1
regiment,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
Boris,	1
betraying	1
neither	1
annoyance	1
at	1
the	1
prince's	1
brusque	1
manner	1
nor	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation,	1
but	1
speaking	1
so	1
quietly	1
and	1
respectfully	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
searching	1
glance.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
living	1
with	1
your	1
mother?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
living	1
at	1
Countess	1
Rostova's,"	1
replied	1
Boris,	1
again	1
adding,	1
"your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"That	1
is,	1
with	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
who	1
married	1
Nataly	1
Shinshina,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
	1
"I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
his	1
monotonous	1
voice.	1
"I	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
how	1
Nataly	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
marry	1
that	1
unlicked	1
bear!	1
A	1
perfectly	1
absurd	1
and	1
stupid	1
fellow,	1
and	1
a	1
gambler	1
too,	1
I	1
am	1
told."	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
man,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
a	1
pathetic	1
smile,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
too	1
knew	1
that	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
deserved	1
this	1
censure,	1
but	1
asked	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
hard	1
on	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
man.	1
"What	1
do	1
the	1
doctors	1
say?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
her	1
worn	1
face	1
again	1
expressing	1
deep	1
sorrow.	1
	1
"They	1
give	1
little	1
hope,"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
should	1
so	1
like	1
to	1
thank	1
Uncle	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
Boris.	1
He	1
is	1
his	1
godson,"	1
she	1
added,	1
her	1
tone	1
suggesting	1
that	1
this	1
fact	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
much	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
became	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
frowned.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
finding	1
in	1
her	1
a	1
rival	1
for	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
fortune,	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
reassure	1
him.	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
sincere	1
affection	1
and	1
devotion	1
to	1
Uncle,"	1
said	1
she,	1
uttering	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
peculiar	1
assurance	1
and	1
unconcern,	1
"I	1
know	1
his	1
character:	1
noble,	1
upright...	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
one	1
with	1
him	1
except	1
the	1
young	1
princesses....	1
They	1
are	1
still	1
young...."	1
She	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
continued	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
"Has	1
he	1
performed	1
his	1
final	1
duty,	1
Prince?	1
How	1
priceless	1
are	1
those	1
last	1
moments!	1
It	1
can	1
make	1
things	1
no	1
worse,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
prepare	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill.	1
We	1
women,	1
Prince,"	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
tenderly,	1
"always	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
these	1
things.	1
I	1
absolutely	1
must	1
see	1
him,	1
however	1
painful	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
suffering."	1
	1
Evidently	1
the	1
prince	1
understood	1
her,	1
and	1
also	1
understood,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
	1
"Would	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
meeting	1
be	1
too	1
trying	1
for	1
him,	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Let	1
us	1
wait	1
until	1
evening.	1
The	1
doctors	1
are	1
expecting	1
a	1
crisis."	1
	1
"But	1
one	1
cannot	1
delay,	1
Prince,	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment!	1
Consider	1
that	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
at	1
stake.	1
Ah,	1
it	1
is	1
awful:	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
a	1
Christian..."	1
	1
A	1
door	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms	1
opened	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
princesses,	1
the	1
count's	1
niece,	1
entered	1
with	1
a	1
cold,	1
stern	1
face.	1
The	1
length	1
of	1
her	1
body	1
was	1
strikingly	1
out	1
of	1
proportion	1
to	1
her	1
short	1
legs.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
turned	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"Still	1
the	1
same;	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
expect,	1
this	1
noise..."	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
looking	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
stranger.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
hardly	1
knew	1
you,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
smile,	1
ambling	1
lightly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
niece.	1
"I	1
have	1
come,	1
and	1
am	1
at	1
your	1
service	1
to	1
help	1
you	1
nurse	1
my	1
uncle.	1
I	1
imagine	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
gone	1
through,"	1
and	1
she	1
sympathetically	1
turned	1
up	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
gave	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
smile,	1
but	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
gloves	1
and,	1
occupying	1
the	1
position	1
she	1
had	1
conquered,	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
inviting	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
her.	1
	1
"Boris,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"I	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count,	1
my	1
uncle;	1
but	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
to	1
Pierre	1
meanwhile	1
and	1
don't	1
forget	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
invitation.	1
They	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
dinner.	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
won't	1
go?"	1
she	1
continued,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince,	1
who	1
had	1
plainly	1
become	1
depressed,	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
only	1
too	1
glad	1
if	1
you	1
relieve	1
me	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
man....	1
Here	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
not	1
once	1
asked	1
for	1
him."	1
	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
A	1
footman	1
conducted	1
Boris	1
down	1
one	1
flight	1
of	1
stairs	1
and	1
up	1
another,	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
rooms.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Pierre,	1
after	1
all,	1
had	1
not	1
managed	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
career	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
expelled	1
from	1
there	1
for	1
riotous	1
conduct	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
story	1
told	1
about	1
him	1
at	1
Count	1
Rostov's	1
was	1
true.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
tying	1
a	1
policeman	1
to	1
a	1
bear.	1
He	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
was	1
staying	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
Though	1
he	1
expected	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
escapade	1
would	1
be	1
already	1
known	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
about	1
his	1
father--who	1
were	1
never	1
favorably	1
disposed	1
toward	1
him--would	1
have	1
used	1
it	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
count	1
against	1
him,	1
he	1
nevertheless	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
Entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
the	1
princesses	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
their	1
time,	1
he	1
greeted	1
the	1
ladies,	1
two	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
embroidery	1
frames	1
while	1
a	1
third	1
read	1
aloud.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
eldest	1
who	1
was	1
reading--the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
met	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
The	1
two	1
younger	1
ones	1
were	1
embroidering:	1
both	1
were	1
rosy	1
and	1
pretty	1
and	1
they	1
differed	1
only	1
in	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
mole	1
on	1
her	1
lip	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
much	1
prettier.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
received	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
corpse	1
or	1
a	1
leper.	1
The	1
eldest	1
princess	1
paused	1
in	1
her	1
reading	1
and	1
silently	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes;	1
the	1
second	1
assumed	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
expression;	1
while	1
the	1
youngest,	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
mole,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
cheerful	1
and	1
lively	1
disposition,	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
frame	1
to	1
hide	1
a	1
smile	1
probably	1
evoked	1
by	1
the	1
amusing	1
scene	1
she	1
foresaw.	1
She	1
drew	1
her	1
wool	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
canvas	1
and,	1
scarcely	1
able	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
laughing,	1
stooped	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
pattern.	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
cousin?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"You	1
don't	1
recognize	1
me?"	1
	1
"I	1
recognize	1
you	1
only	1
too	1
well,	1
too	1
well."	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
the	1
count?	1
Can	1
I	1
see	1
him?"	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
awkwardly	1
as	1
usual,	1
but	1
unabashed.	1
	1
"The	1
count	1
is	1
suffering	1
physically	1
and	1
mentally,	1
and	1
apparently	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
your	1
best	1
to	1
increase	1
his	1
mental	1
sufferings."	1
	1
"Can	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
count?"	1
Pierre	1
again	1
asked.	1
	1
"Hm....	1
If	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
outright,	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
him...	1
Olga,	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
Uncle's	1
beef	1
tea	1
is	1
ready--it	1
is	1
almost	1
time,"	1
she	1
added,	1
giving	1
Pierre	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
busy,	1
and	1
busy	1
making	1
his	1
father	1
comfortable,	1
while	1
evidently	1
he,	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
only	1
busy	1
causing	1
him	1
annoyance.	1
	1
Olga	1
went	1
out.	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
sisters;	1
then	1
he	1
bowed	1
and	1
said:	1
"Then	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
rooms.	1
You	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
him."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
low	1
but	1
ringing	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
sister	1
with	1
the	1
mole.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
arrived	1
and	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
count's	1
house.	1
He	1
sent	1
for	1
Pierre	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
behave	1
here	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
you	1
will	1
end	1
very	1
badly;	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
The	1
count	1
is	1
very,	1
very	1
ill,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
Since	1
then	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
disturbed	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
rooms	1
upstairs.	1
	1
When	1
Boris	1
appeared	1
at	1
his	1
door	1
Pierre	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
room,	1
stopping	1
occasionally	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
to	1
make	1
menacing	1
gestures	1
at	1
the	1
wall,	1
as	1
if	1
running	1
a	1
sword	1
through	1
an	1
invisible	1
foe,	1
and	1
glaring	1
savagely	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
resuming	1
his	1
walk,	1
muttering	1
indistinct	1
words,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
gesticulating.	1
	1
"England	1
is	1
done	1
for,"	1
said	1
he,	1
scowling	1
and	1
pointing	1
his	1
finger	1
at	1
someone	1
unseen.	1
"Mr.	1
Pitt,	1
as	1
a	1
traitor	1
to	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
man,	1
is	1
sentenced	1
to..."	1
But	1
before	1
Pierre--who	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
imagined	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
just	1
effected	1
the	1
dangerous	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Straits	1
of	1
Dover	1
and	1
captured	1
London--could	1
pronounce	1
Pitt's	1
sentence,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
well-built	1
and	1
handsome	1
young	1
officer	1
entering	1
his	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
paused.	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow	1
when	1
Boris	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
and	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
him,	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
impulsive	1
and	1
hearty	1
way	1
he	1
took	1
Boris	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
smile.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember	1
me?"	1
asked	1
Boris	1
quietly	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile.	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
with	1
my	1
mother	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count,	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
well."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
is	1
ill.	1
People	1
are	1
always	1
disturbing	1
him,"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
who	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
was.	1
	1
Boris	1
felt	1
that	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
him	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
introduce	1
himself,	1
and	1
without	1
experiencing	1
the	1
least	1
embarrassment	1
looked	1
Pierre	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
"Count	1
Rostov	1
asks	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
today,"	1
said	1
he,	1
after	1
a	1
considerable	1
pause	1
which	1
made	1
Pierre	1
feel	1
uncomfortable.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Count	1
Rostov!"	1
exclaimed	1
Pierre	1
joyfully.	1
"Then	1
you	1
are	1
his	1
son,	1
Ilya?	1
Only	1
fancy,	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
you	1
at	1
first.	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Sparrow	1
Hills	1
with	1
Madame	1
Jacquot?...	1
It's	1
such	1
an	1
age..."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken,"	1
said	1
Boris	1
deliberately,	1
with	1
a	1
bold	1
and	1
slightly	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
"I	1
am	1
Boris,	1
son	1
of	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
Drubetskaya.	1
Rostov,	1
the	1
father,	1
is	1
Ilya,	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
Nicholas.	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
any	1
Madame	1
Jacquot."	1
	1
Pierre	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
attacked	1
by	1
mosquitoes	1
or	1
bees.	1
	1
"Oh	1
dear,	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
thinking	1
about?	1
I've	1
mixed	1
everything	1
up.	1
One	1
has	1
so	1
many	1
relatives	1
in	1
Moscow!	1
So	1
you	1
are	1
Boris?	1
Of	1
course.	1
Well,	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
where	1
we	1
are.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
Boulogne	1
expedition?	1
The	1
English	1
will	1
come	1
off	1
badly,	1
you	1
know,	1
if	1
Napoleon	1
gets	1
across	1
the	1
Channel.	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
expedition	1
is	1
quite	1
feasible.	1
If	1
only	1
Villeneuve	1
doesn't	1
make	1
a	1
mess	1
of	1
things!"	1
	1
Boris	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
the	1
Boulogne	1
expedition;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
Villeneuve's	1
name.	1
	1
"We	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
are	1
more	1
occupied	1
with	1
dinner	1
parties	1
and	1
scandal	1
than	1
with	1
politics,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
quiet	1
ironical	1
tone.	1
"I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
thought	1
about	1
it.	1
Moscow	1
is	1
chiefly	1
busy	1
with	1
gossip,"	1
he	1
continued.	1
"Just	1
now	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
father."	1
	1
Pierre	1
smiled	1
in	1
his	1
good-natured	1
way	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
for	1
his	1
companion's	1
sake	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
might	1
say	1
something	1
he	1
would	1
afterwards	1
regret.	1
But	1
Boris	1
spoke	1
distinctly,	1
clearly,	1
and	1
dryly,	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Moscow	1
has	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
gossip,"	1
Boris	1
went	1
on.	1
"Everybody	1
is	1
wondering	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
will	1
leave	1
his	1
fortune,	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
perhaps	1
outlive	1
us	1
all,	1
as	1
I	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
he	1
will..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
horrid,"	1
interrupted	1
Pierre,	1
"very	1
horrid."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
still	1
afraid	1
that	1
this	1
officer	1
might	1
inadvertently	1
say	1
something	1
disconcerting	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
"And	1
it	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
Boris	1
flushing	1
slightly,	1
but	1
not	1
changing	1
his	1
tone	1
or	1
attitude,	1
"it	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
everyone	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
man?"	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
does,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
just	1
wish	1
to	1
say,	1
to	1
avoid	1
misunderstandings,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
mistaken	1
if	1
you	1
reckon	1
me	1
or	1
my	1
mother	1
among	1
such	1
people.	1
We	1
are	1
very	1
poor,	1
but	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
reason	1
that	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
rich,	1
I	1
don't	1
regard	1
myself	1
as	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
neither	1
I	1
nor	1
my	1
mother	1
would	1
ever	1
ask	1
or	1
take	1
anything	1
from	1
him."	1
	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
understand,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
did,	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sofa,	1
seized	1
Boris	1
under	1
the	1
elbow	1
in	1
his	1
quick,	1
clumsy	1
way,	1
and,	1
blushing	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
Boris,	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
mingled	1
shame	1
and	1
vexation.	1
	1
"Well,	1
this	1
is	1
strange!	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I...	1
who	1
could	1
think?...	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well..."	1
	1
But	1
Boris	1
again	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
out	1
fully.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it?	1
You	1
must	1
excuse	1
me,"	1
said	1
he,	1
putting	1
Pierre	1
at	1
ease	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
put	1
at	1
ease	1
by	1
him,	1
"but	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
offended	1
you.	1
I	1
always	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1
speak	1
out...	1
Well,	1
what	1
answer	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
take?	1
Will	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'?"	1
	1
And	1
Boris,	1
having	1
apparently	1
relieved	1
himself	1
of	1
an	1
onerous	1
duty	1
and	1
extricated	1
himself	1
from	1
an	1
awkward	1
situation	1
and	1
placed	1
another	1
in	1
it,	1
became	1
quite	1
pleasant	1
again.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
say,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
calming	1
down,	1
"you	1
are	1
a	1
wonderful	1
fellow!	1
What	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
said	1
is	1
good,	1
very	1
good.	1
Of	1
course	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
me.	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
met	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time...	1
not	1
since	1
we	1
were	1
children.	1
You	1
might	1
think	1
that	1
I...	1
I	1
understand,	1
quite	1
understand.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
myself,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
courage,	1
but	1
it's	1
splendid.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
acquaintance.	1
It's	1
queer,"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
suspected	1
me!"	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
it!	1
I	1
hope	1
we'll	1
get	1
better	1
acquainted,"	1
and	1
he	1
pressed	1
Boris'	1
hand.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
once	1
been	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
sent	1
for	1
me....	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
one	1
do?"	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
you	1
think	1
Napoleon	1
will	1
manage	1
to	1
get	1
an	1
army	1
across?"	1
asked	1
Boris	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
Boris	1
wished	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
the	1
Boulogne	1
expedition.	1
	1
A	1
footman	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
summon	1
Boris--the	1
princess	1
was	1
going.	1
Pierre,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
Boris'	1
better	1
acquaintance,	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner,	1
and	1
warmly	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
looked	1
affectionately	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
into	1
Boris'	1
eyes.	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
Pierre	1
continued	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
no	1
longer	1
piercing	1
an	1
imaginary	1
foe	1
with	1
his	1
imaginary	1
sword,	1
but	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
that	1
pleasant,	1
intelligent,	1
and	1
resolute	1
young	1
man.	1
	1
As	1
often	1
happens	1
in	1
early	1
youth,	1
especially	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
leads	1
a	1
lonely	1
life,	1
he	1
felt	1
an	1
unaccountable	1
tenderness	1
for	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
friends.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
saw	1
the	1
princess	1
off.	1
She	1
held	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
tearful.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
dreadful,	1
dreadful!"	1
she	1
was	1
saying,	1
"but	1
cost	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
may	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
duty.	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
night.	1
He	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
like	1
this.	1
Every	1
moment	1
is	1
precious.	1
I	1
can't	1
think	1
why	1
his	1
nieces	1
put	1
it	1
off.	1
Perhaps	1
God	1
will	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
prepare	1
him!...	1
Adieu,	1
Prince!	1
May	1
God	1
support	1
you..."	1
	1
"Adieu,	1
ma	1
bonne,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
state,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
carriage.	1
"He	1
hardly	1
recognizes	1
anybody."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand,	1
Mamma--what	1
is	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
Pierre?"	1
asked	1
the	1
son.	1
	1
"The	1
will	1
will	1
show	1
that,	1
my	1
dear;	1
our	1
fate	1
also	1
depends	1
on	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
us	1
anything?"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear!	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
rich,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
so	1
poor!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
that	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
sufficient	1
reason,	1
Mamma..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Heaven!	1
How	1
ill	1
he	1
is!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
mother.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
After	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
had	1
driven	1
off	1
with	1
her	1
son	1
to	1
visit	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov,	1
Countess	1
Rostova	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
all	1
alone	1
applying	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
her	1
eyes.	1
At	1
last	1
she	1
rang.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
she	1
said	1
crossly	1
to	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
kept	1
her	1
waiting	1
some	1
minutes.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
serve	1
me?	1
Then	1
I'll	1
find	1
you	1
another	1
place."	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
upset	1
by	1
her	1
friend's	1
sorrow	1
and	1
humiliating	1
poverty,	1
and	1
was	1
therefore	1
out	1
of	1
sorts,	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
with	1
her	1
always	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
calling	1
her	1
maid	1
"my	1
dear"	1
and	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
exaggerated	1
politeness.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry,	1
ma'am,"	1
answered	1
the	1
maid.	1
	1
"Ask	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
came	1
waddling	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
guilty	1
look	1
as	1
usual.	1
	1
"Well,	1
little	1
countess?	1
What	1
a	1
saute	1
of	1
game	1
au	1
madere	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
have,	1
my	1
dear!	1
I	1
tasted	1
it.	1
The	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
I	1
paid	1
for	1
Taras	1
were	1
not	1
ill-	1
spent.	1
He	1
is	1
worth	1
it!"	1
	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
wife,	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
ruffling	1
his	1
gray	1
hair.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
your	1
commands,	1
little	1
countess?"	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
my	1
dear...	1
What's	1
that	1
mess?"	1
she	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
waistcoat.	1
"It's	1
the	1
saute,	1
most	1
likely,"	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
Count,	1
I	1
want	1
some	1
money."	1
	1
Her	1
face	1
became	1
sad.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
little	1
countess!"...	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
began	1
bustling	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
his	1
pocketbook.	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
Count!	1
I	1
want	1
five	1
hundred	1
rubles,"	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
her	1
cambric	1
handkerchief	1
she	1
began	1
wiping	1
her	1
husband's	1
waistcoat.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
immediately,	1
immediately!	1
Hey,	1
who's	1
there?"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
only	1
used	1
by	1
persons	1
who	1
are	1
certain	1
that	1
those	1
they	1
call	1
will	1
rush	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
summons.	1
"Send	1
Dmitri	1
to	1
me!"	1
	1
Dmitri,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
count's	1
house	1
and	1
now	1
managed	1
all	1
his	1
affairs,	1
stepped	1
softly	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
want,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
the	1
deferential	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
entered.	1
"Bring	1
me..."	1
he	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment,	1
"yes,	1
bring	1
me	1
seven	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
yes!	1
But	1
mind,	1
don't	1
bring	1
me	1
such	1
tattered	1
and	1
dirty	1
notes	1
as	1
last	1
time,	1
but	1
nice	1
clean	1
ones	1
for	1
the	1
countess."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Dmitri,	1
clean	1
ones,	1
please,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
sighing	1
deeply.	1
	1
"When	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
them,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
asked	1
Dmitri.	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
inform	1
you...	1
But,	1
don't	1
be	1
uneasy,"	1
he	1
added,	1
noticing	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
breathe	1
heavily	1
and	1
quickly	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
approaching	1
anger.	1
"I	1
was	1
forgetting...	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
it	1
brought	1
at	1
once?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes;	1
just	1
so!	1
Bring	1
it.	1
Give	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
countess."	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
treasure	1
that	1
Dmitri	1
is,"	1
added	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
when	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
departed.	1
"There	1
is	1
never	1
any	1
'impossible'	1
with	1
him.	1
That's	1
a	1
thing	1
I	1
hate!	1
Everything	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
money,	1
Count,	1
money!	1
How	1
much	1
sorrow	1
it	1
causes	1
in	1
the	1
world,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
great	1
need	1
of	1
this	1
sum."	1
	1
"You,	1
my	1
little	1
countess,	1
are	1
a	1
notorious	1
spendthrift,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
having	1
kissed	1
his	1
wife's	1
hand	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
study.	1
	1
When	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
returned	1
from	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
the	1
money,	1
all	1
in	1
clean	1
notes,	1
was	1
lying	1
ready	1
under	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
on	1
the	1
countess'	1
little	1
table,	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
noticed	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
agitating	1
her.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
state	1
he	1
is	1
in!	1
One	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
him,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill!	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
there	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
and	1
hardly	1
said	1
a	1
word..."	1
	1
"Annette,	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
don't	1
refuse	1
me,"	1
the	1
countess	1
began,	1
with	1
a	1
blush	1
that	1
looked	1
very	1
strange	1
on	1
her	1
thin,	1
dignified,	1
elderly	1
face,	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
money	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
handkerchief.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
instantly	1
guessed	1
her	1
intention	1
and	1
stooped	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1
countess	1
at	1
the	1
appropriate	1
moment.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
for	1
Boris	1
from	1
me,	1
for	1
his	1
outfit."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
was	1
already	1
embracing	1
her	1
and	1
weeping.	1
The	1
countess	1
wept	1
too.	1
They	1
wept	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
friends,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
kindhearted,	1
and	1
because	1
they--friends	1
from	1
childhood--had	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
base	1
thing	1
as	1
money,	1
and	1
because	1
their	1
youth	1
was	1
over....	1
But	1
those	1
tears	1
were	1
pleasant	1
to	1
them	1
both.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Countess	1
Rostova,	1
with	1
her	1
daughters	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
guests,	1
was	1
already	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
count	1
took	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
showed	1
them	1
his	1
choice	1
collection	1
of	1
Turkish	1
pipes.	1
From	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
ask:	1
"Hasn't	1
she	1
come	1
yet?"	1
They	1
were	1
expecting	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
Akhrosimova,	1
known	1
in	1
society	1
as	1
le	1
terrible	1
dragon,	1
a	1
lady	1
distinguished	1
not	1
for	1
wealth	1
or	1
rank,	1
but	1
for	1
common	1
sense	1
and	1
frank	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
Moscow	1
and	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
both	1
cities	1
wondered	1
at	1
her,	1
laughed	1
privately	1
at	1
her	1
rudenesses,	1
and	1
told	1
good	1
stories	1
about	1
her,	1
while	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
all	1
without	1
exception	1
respected	1
and	1
feared	1
her.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
count's	1
room,	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
tobacco	1
smoke,	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
war	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
announced	1
in	1
a	1
manifesto,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
recruiting.	1
None	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
yet	1
seen	1
the	1
manifesto,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
knew	1
it	1
had	1
appeared.	1
The	1
count	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
between	1
two	1
guests	1
who	1
were	1
smoking	1
and	1
talking.	1
He	1
neither	1
smoked	1
nor	1
talked,	1
but	1
bending	1
his	1
head	1
first	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
watched	1
the	1
smokers	1
with	1
evident	1
pleasure	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
neighbors,	1
whom	1
he	1
egged	1
on	1
against	1
each	1
other.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
sallow,	1
clean-shaven	1
civilian	1
with	1
a	1
thin	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
face,	1
already	1
growing	1
old,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
like	1
a	1
most	1
fashionable	1
young	1
man.	1
He	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
as	1
if	1
quite	1
at	1
home	1
and,	1
having	1
stuck	1
an	1
amber	1
mouthpiece	1
far	1
into	1
his	1
mouth,	1
was	1
inhaling	1
the	1
smoke	1
spasmodically	1
and	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes.	1
This	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
bachelor,	1
Shinshin,	1
a	1
cousin	1
of	1
the	1
countess',	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
"a	1
sharp	1
tongue"	1
as	1
they	1
said	1
in	1
Moscow	1
society.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
condescending	1
to	1
his	1
companion.	1
The	1
latter,	1
a	1
fresh,	1
rosy	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards,	1
irreproachably	1
washed,	1
brushed,	1
and	1
buttoned,	1
held	1
his	1
pipe	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
with	1
red	1
lips	1
gently	1
inhaled	1
the	1
smoke,	1
letting	1
it	1
escape	1
from	1
his	1
handsome	1
mouth	1
in	1
rings.	1
This	1
was	1
Lieutenant	1
Berg,	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment	1
with	1
whom	1
Boris	1
was	1
to	1
travel	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
about	1
whom	1
Natasha	1
had	1
teased	1
her	1
elder	1
sister	1
Vera,	1
speaking	1
of	1
Berg	1
as	1
her	1
"intended."	1
The	1
count	1
sat	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
listened	1
attentively.	1
His	1
favorite	1
occupation	1
when	1
not	1
playing	1
boston,	1
a	1
card	1
game	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of,	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
listener,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
setting	1
two	1
loquacious	1
talkers	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
old	1
chap,	1
mon	1
tres	1
honorable	1
Alphonse	1
Karlovich,"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
laughing	1
ironically	1
and	1
mixing	1
the	1
most	1
ordinary	1
Russian	1
expressions	1
with	1
the	1
choicest	1
French	1
phrases--which	1
was	1
a	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
his	1
speech.	1
"Vous	1
comptez	1
vous	1
faire	1
des	1
rentes	1
sur	1
l'etat;	1
*	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
company?"	1
	1
	1
*	1
You	1
expect	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
income	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
	1
"No,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich;	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry	1
the	1
advantages	1
are	1
far	1
less	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
infantry.	1
Just	1
consider	1
my	1
own	1
position	1
now,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich..."	1
	1
Berg	1
always	1
spoke	1
quietly,	1
politely,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
precision.	1
His	1
conversation	1
always	1
related	1
entirely	1
to	1
himself;	1
he	1
would	1
remain	1
calm	1
and	1
silent	1
when	1
the	1
talk	1
related	1
to	1
any	1
topic	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
direct	1
bearing	1
on	1
himself.	1
He	1
could	1
remain	1
silent	1
for	1
hours	1
without	1
being	1
at	1
all	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
countenance	1
himself	1
or	1
making	1
others	1
uncomfortable,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
conversation	1
concerned	1
himself	1
he	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
talk	1
circumstantially	1
and	1
with	1
evident	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
"Consider	1
my	1
position,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich.	1
Were	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry	1
I	1
should	1
get	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
every	1
four	1
months,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
lieutenant;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
receive	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty,"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
Shinshin	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
a	1
joyful,	1
pleasant	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
obvious	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
success	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
chief	1
desire	1
of	1
everyone	1
else.	1
	1
"Besides	1
that,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich,	1
by	1
exchanging	1
into	1
the	1
Guards	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
prominent	1
position,"	1
continued	1
Berg,	1
"and	1
vacancies	1
occur	1
much	1
more	1
frequently	1
in	1
the	1
Foot	1
Guards.	1
Then	1
just	1
think	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
rubles!	1
I	1
even	1
manage	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
little	1
aside	1
and	1
to	1
send	1
something	1
to	1
my	1
father,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
emitting	1
a	1
smoke	1
ring.	1
	1
"La	1
balance	1
y	1
est...	1
*	1
A	1
German	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
skin	1
a	1
flint,	1
as	1
the	1
proverb	1
says,"	1
remarked	1
Shinshin,	1
moving	1
his	1
pipe	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
winking	1
at	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
	1
*	1
So	1
that	1
squares	1
matters.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
The	1
other	1
guests	1
seeing	1
that	1
Shinshin	1
was	1
talking	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
listen.	1
Berg,	1
oblivious	1
of	1
irony	1
or	1
indifference,	1
continued	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
by	1
exchanging	1
into	1
the	1
Guards	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
gained	1
a	1
step	1
on	1
his	1
old	1
comrades	1
of	1
the	1
Cadet	1
Corps;	1
how	1
in	1
wartime	1
the	1
company	1
commander	1
might	1
get	1
killed	1
and	1
he,	1
as	1
senior	1
in	1
the	1
company,	1
might	1
easily	1
succeed	1
to	1
the	1
post;	1
how	1
popular	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
and	1
how	1
satisfied	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
Berg	1
evidently	1
enjoyed	1
narrating	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
suspect	1
that	1
others,	1
too,	1
might	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
interests.	1
But	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
so	1
prettily	1
sedate,	1
and	1
the	1
naivete	1
of	1
his	1
youthful	1
egotism	1
was	1
so	1
obvious,	1
that	1
he	1
disarmed	1
his	1
hearers.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
boy,	1
you'll	1
get	1
along	1
wherever	1
you	1
go--foot	1
or	1
horse--that	1
I'll	1
warrant,"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
patting	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
feet	1
off	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
Berg	1
smiled	1
joyously.	1
The	1
count,	1
by	1
his	1
guests,	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
moment	1
before	1
a	1
big	1
dinner	1
when	1
the	1
assembled	1
guests,	1
expecting	1
the	1
summons	1
to	1
zakuska,	1
*	1
avoid	1
engaging	1
in	1
any	1
long	1
conversation	1
but	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
move	1
about	1
and	1
talk,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
impatient	1
for	1
their	1
food.	1
The	1
host	1
and	1
hostess	1
look	1
toward	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
glance	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
visitors	1
try	1
to	1
guess	1
from	1
these	1
glances	1
who,	1
or	1
what,	1
they	1
are	1
waiting	1
for--some	1
important	1
relation	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
arrived,	1
or	1
a	1
dish	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
ready.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Hors	1
d'oeuvres.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
come	1
just	1
at	1
dinnertime	1
and	1
was	1
sitting	1
awkwardly	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
chair	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
across,	1
blocking	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
everyone.	1
The	1
countess	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
talk,	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
naively	1
looking	1
around	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
somebody	1
and	1
answered	1
all	1
her	1
questions	1
in	1
monosyllables.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
fact.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
guests,	1
knowing	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
with	1
the	1
bear,	1
looked	1
with	1
curiosity	1
at	1
this	1
big,	1
stout,	1
quiet	1
man,	1
wondering	1
how	1
such	1
a	1
clumsy,	1
modest	1
fellow	1
could	1
have	1
played	1
such	1
a	1
prank	1
on	1
a	1
policeman.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
only	1
lately	1
arrived?"	1
the	1
countess	1
asked	1
him.	1
	1
"Oui,	1
madame,"	1
replied	1
he,	1
looking	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
my	1
husband?"	1
	1
"Non,	1
madame."	1
He	1
smiled	1
quite	1
inappropriately.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
Paris	1
recently,	1
I	1
believe?	1
I	1
suppose	1
it's	1
very	1
interesting."	1
	1
"Very	1
interesting."	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
The	1
latter	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
being	1
asked	1
to	1
entertain	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
his	1
father;	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
her,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
countess,	1
only	1
in	1
monosyllables.	1
The	1
other	1
guests	1
were	1
all	1
conversing	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
"The	1
Razumovskis...	1
It	1
was	1
charming...	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
kind...	1
Countess	1
Apraksina..."	1
was	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
The	1
countess	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
	1
"Marya	1
Dmitrievna?"	1
came	1
her	1
voice	1
from	1
there.	1
	1
"Herself,"	1
came	1
the	1
answer	1
in	1
a	1
rough	1
voice,	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
unmarried	1
ladies	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
married	1
ones	1
except	1
the	1
very	1
oldest	1
rose.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Tall	1
and	1
stout,	1
holding	1
high	1
her	1
fifty-year-old	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
gray	1
curls,	1
she	1
stood	1
surveying	1
the	1
guests,	1
and	1
leisurely	1
arranged	1
her	1
wide	1
sleeves	1
as	1
if	1
rolling	1
them	1
up.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
always	1
spoke	1
in	1
Russian.	1
	1
"Health	1
and	1
happiness	1
to	1
her	1
whose	1
name	1
day	1
we	1
are	1
keeping	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
children,"	1
she	1
said,	1
in	1
her	1
loud,	1
full-toned	1
voice	1
which	1
drowned	1
all	1
others.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
old	1
sinner,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
who	1
was	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand,	1
"you're	1
feeling	1
dull	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
I	1
daresay?	1
Nowhere	1
to	1
hunt	1
with	1
your	1
dogs?	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
old	1
man?	1
Just	1
see	1
how	1
these	1
nestlings	1
are	1
growing	1
up,"	1
and	1
she	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
girls.	1
"You	1
must	1
look	1
for	1
husbands	1
for	1
them	1
whether	1
you	1
like	1
it	1
or	1
not...."	1
	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"how's	1
my	1
Cossack?"	1
(Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
always	1
called	1
Natasha	1
a	1
Cossack)	1
and	1
she	1
stroked	1
the	1
child's	1
arm	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
fearless	1
and	1
gay	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hand.	1
"I	1
know	1
she's	1
a	1
scamp	1
of	1
a	1
girl,	1
but	1
I	1
like	1
her."	1
	1
She	1
took	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
pear-shaped	1
ruby	1
earrings	1
from	1
her	1
huge	1
reticule	1
and,	1
having	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
rosy	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
beamed	1
with	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
her	1
saint's-day	1
fete,	1
turned	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
addressed	1
herself	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
eh,	1
friend!	1
Come	1
here	1
a	1
bit,"	1
said	1
she,	1
assuming	1
a	1
soft	1
high	1
tone	1
of	1
voice.	1
"Come	1
here,	1
my	1
friend..."	1
and	1
she	1
ominously	1
tucked	1
up	1
her	1
sleeves	1
still	1
higher.	1
Pierre	1
approached,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
childlike	1
way	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"Come	1
nearer,	1
come	1
nearer,	1
friend!	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
to	1
tell	1
your	1
father	1
the	1
truth	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
favor,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
case	1
it's	1
my	1
evident	1
duty."	1
She	1
paused.	1
All	1
were	1
silent,	1
expectant	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
follow,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
clearly	1
only	1
a	1
prelude.	1
	1
"A	1
fine	1
lad!	1
My	1
word!	1
A	1
fine	1
lad!...	1
His	1
father	1
lies	1
on	1
his	1
deathbed	1
and	1
he	1
amuses	1
himself	1
setting	1
a	1
policeman	1
astride	1
a	1
bear!	1
For	1
shame,	1
sir,	1
for	1
shame!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
if	1
you	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
war."	1
	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
from	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
table?"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
went	1
in	1
first	1
with	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
the	1
countess	1
followed	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
a	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
them	1
because	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
regiment;	1
then	1
came	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
Shinshin.	1
Berg	1
gave	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
Vera.	1
The	1
smiling	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
Nicholas.	1
After	1
them	1
other	1
couples	1
followed,	1
filling	1
the	1
whole	1
dining	1
hall,	1
and	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children,	1
tutors,	1
and	1
governesses	1
followed	1
singly.	1
The	1
footmen	1
began	1
moving	1
about,	1
chairs	1
scraped,	1
the	1
band	1
struck	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
gallery,	1
and	1
the	1
guests	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
places.	1
Then	1
the	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
household	1
band	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
knives	1
and	1
forks,	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
visitors,	1
and	1
the	1
soft	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
footmen.	1
At	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
sat	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
on	1
her	1
right	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
on	1
her	1
left,	1
the	1
other	1
lady	1
visitors	1
were	1
farther	1
down.	1
At	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
sat	1
the	1
count,	1
with	1
the	1
hussar	1
colonel	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
and	1
Shinshin	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
male	1
visitors	1
on	1
his	1
right.	1
Midway	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
table	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
sat	1
the	1
grownup	1
young	1
people:	1
Vera	1
beside	1
Berg,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
beside	1
Boris;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
the	1
children,	1
tutors,	1
and	1
governesses.	1
From	1
behind	1
the	1
crystal	1
decanters	1
and	1
fruit	1
vases,	1
the	1
count	1
kept	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
tall	1
cap	1
with	1
its	1
light-blue	1
ribbons,	1
and	1
busily	1
filled	1
his	1
neighbors'	1
glasses,	1
not	1
neglecting	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
countess	1
in	1
turn,	1
without	1
omitting	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess,	1
threw	1
significant	1
glances	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
pineapples	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
whose	1
face	1
and	1
bald	1
head	1
seemed	1
by	1
their	1
redness	1
to	1
contrast	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
with	1
his	1
gray	1
hair.	1
At	1
the	1
ladies'	1
end	1
an	1
even	1
chatter	1
of	1
voices	1
was	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
at	1
the	1
men's	1
end	1
the	1
voices	1
sounded	1
louder	1
and	1
louder,	1
especially	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars	1
who,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
flushed,	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
held	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
pattern	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
guests.	1
Berg	1
with	1
tender	1
smiles	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
Vera	1
that	1
love	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
earthly	1
but	1
a	1
heavenly	1
feeling.	1
Boris	1
was	1
telling	1
his	1
new	1
friend	1
Pierre	1
who	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
and	1
exchanging	1
glances	1
with	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite.	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
little	1
but	1
examined	1
the	1
new	1
faces,	1
and	1
ate	1
a	1
great	1
deal.	1
Of	1
the	1
two	1
soups	1
he	1
chose	1
turtle	1
with	1
savory	1
patties	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
game	1
without	1
omitting	1
a	1
single	1
dish	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wines.	1
These	1
latter	1
the	1
butler	1
thrust	1
mysteriously	1
forward,	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
napkin,	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
next	1
man's	1
shoulders	1
and	1
whispered:	1
"Dry	1
Madeira"...	1
"Hungarian"...	1
or	1
"Rhine	1
wine"	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
be.	1
Of	1
the	1
four	1
crystal	1
glasses	1
engraved	1
with	1
the	1
count's	1
monogram	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
his	1
plate,	1
Pierre	1
held	1
out	1
one	1
at	1
random	1
and	1
drank	1
with	1
enjoyment,	1
gazing	1
with	1
ever-	1
increasing	1
amiability	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
guests.	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite,	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
Boris	1
as	1
girls	1
of	1
thirteen	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
boy	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
and	1
have	1
just	1
kissed	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
Sometimes	1
that	1
same	1
look	1
fell	1
on	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
that	1
funny	1
lively	1
little	1
girl's	1
look	1
made	1
him	1
inclined	1
to	1
laugh	1
without	1
knowing	1
why.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
sat	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
Sonya,	1
beside	1
Julie	1
Karagina,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
talking	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
involuntary	1
smile.	1
Sonya	1
wore	1
a	1
company	1
smile	1
but	1
was	1
evidently	1
tormented	1
by	1
jealousy;	1
now	1
she	1
turned	1
pale,	1
now	1
blushed	1
and	1
strained	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
overhear	1
what	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Julie	1
were	1
saying	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
governess	1
kept	1
looking	1
round	1
uneasily	1
as	1
if	1
preparing	1
to	1
resent	1
any	1
slight	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
put	1
upon	1
the	1
children.	1
The	1
German	1
tutor	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
all	1
the	1
dishes,	1
wines,	1
and	1
kinds	1
of	1
dessert,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
full	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
Germany;	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
greatly	1
offended	1
when	1
the	1
butler	1
with	1
a	1
bottle	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
napkin	1
passed	1
him	1
by.	1
He	1
frowned,	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
any	1
of	1
that	1
wine,	1
but	1
was	1
mortified	1
because	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
quench	1
his	1
thirst	1
or	1
from	1
greediness	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
it,	1
but	1
simply	1
from	1
a	1
conscientious	1
desire	1
for	1
knowledge.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
At	1
the	1
men's	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
talk	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated.	1
The	1
colonel	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
declaration	1
of	1
war	1
had	1
already	1
appeared	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
copy,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
seen,	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
been	1
forwarded	1
by	1
courier	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
the	1
deuce	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
fight	1
Bonaparte?"	1
remarked	1
Shinshin.	1
"He	1
has	1
stopped	1
Austria's	1
cackle	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
our	1
turn	1
next."	1
	1
The	1
colonel	1
was	1
a	1
stout,	1
tall,	1
plethoric	1
German,	1
evidently	1
devoted	1
to	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
patriotically	1
Russian.	1
He	1
resented	1
Shinshin's	1
remark.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
reasson,	1
my	1
goot	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he,	1
speaking	1
with	1
a	1
German	1
accent,	1
"for	1
the	1
reasson	1
zat	1
ze	1
Emperor	1
knows	1
zat.	1
He	1
declares	1
in	1
ze	1
manifessto	1

and	1
dignity	1
of	1
ze	1
Empire	1
as	1
vell	1
as	1
ze	1
sanctity	1
of	1
its	1
alliances..."	1
he	1
spoke	1
this	1
last	1
word	1
with	1
particular	1
emphasis	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
it	1
lay	1
the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
Then	1
with	1
the	1
unerring	1
official	1
memory	1
that	1
characterized	1
him	1
he	1
repeated	1
from	1
the	1
opening	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
manifesto:	1
	1
...	1
and	1
the	1
wish,	1
which	1
constitutes	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
sole	1
and	1
absolute	1
aim-	1
-to	1
establish	1
peace	1
in	1
Europe	1
on	1
firm	1
foundations--has	1
now	1
decided	1
him	1
to	1
despatch	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
abroad	1
and	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
new	1
condition	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
that	1
purpose.	1
	1
"Zat,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
is	1
vy..."	1
he	1
concluded,	1
drinking	1
a	1
tumbler	1
of	1
wine	1
with	1
dignity	1
and	1
looking	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
for	1
approval.	1
	1
"Connaissez-vous	1
le	1
Proverbe:	1
*	1
'Jerome,	1
Jerome,	1
do	1
not	1
roam,	1
but	1
turn	1
spindles	1
at	1
home!'?"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
puckering	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
smiling.	1
"Cela	1
nous	1
convient	1
a	1
merveille.*(2)	1
Suvorov	1
now--he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about;	1
yet	1
they	1
beat	1
him	1
a	1
plate	1
couture,*(3)	1
and	1
where	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
find	1
Suvorovs	1
now?	1
Je	1
vous	1
demande	1

said	1
he,	1
continually	1
changing	1
from	1
French	1
to	1
Russian.	1
	1
	1
*Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
proverb?	1
	1

That	1

	1
*(3)	1
Hollow.	1
	1
*(4)	1
I	1
just	1
ask	1

that.	1
	1
"Ve	1
must	1
vight	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
tr-r-op	1
of	1
our	1
plood!"	1
said	1
the	1
colonel,	1
thumping	1
the	1
table;	1
"and	1
ve	1
must	1
tie	1
for	1
our	1
Emperor,	1
and	1

pe	1

And	1
ve	1
must	1
discuss	1
it	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
po-o-ossible"...	1
he	1
dwelt	1
particularly	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
possible...	1
"as	1
po-o-ossible,"	1
he	1
ended,	1
again	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
"Zat	1
is	1
how	1
ve	1
old	1
hussars	1
look	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
zere's	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it!	1
And	1
how	1
do	1
you,	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
hussar,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
judge	1
of	1
it?"	1
he	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
being	1
discussed	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
his	1
partner	1
with	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
intent	1
on	1
the	1
colonel.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
quite	1
of	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas,	1
flaming	1
up,	1
turning	1
his	1
plate	1
round	1
and	1
moving	1
his	1
wineglasses	1
about	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
decision	1
and	1
desperation	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
facing	1
some	1
great	1
danger.	1
"I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
we	1
Russians	1
must	1
die	1
or	1
conquer,"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
conscious--as	1
were	1
others--after	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
uttered	1
that	1
his	1
remarks	1
were	1
too	1
enthusiastic	1
and	1
emphatic	1
for	1
the	1
occasion	1
and	1
were	1
therefore	1
awkward.	1
	1
"What	1
you	1
said	1
just	1
now	1
was	1
splendid!"	1
said	1
his	1
partner	1
Julie.	1
	1
Sonya	1
trembled	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
blushed	1
to	1
her	1
ears	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
and	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1
while	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
speaking.	1
	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
colonel's	1
speech	1
and	1
nodded	1
approvingly.	1
	1
"That's	1
fine,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"The	1
young	1
man's	1
a	1
real	1
hussar!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
colonel,	1
again	1
thumping	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
noise	1
about	1
over	1
there?"	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
deep	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
inquired	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
thumping	1
the	1
table	1
for?"	1
she	1
demanded	1
of	1
the	1
hussar,	1
"and	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
exciting	1
yourself?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
French	1
are	1
here?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
speaking	1
ze	1
truce,"	1
replied	1
the	1
hussar	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
war,"	1
the	1
count	1
shouted	1
down	1
the	1
table.	1
"You	1
know	1
my	1
son's	1
going,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna?	1
My	1
son	1
is	1
going."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
four	1
sons	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
don't	1
fret.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
in	1
God's	1
hands.	1
You	1
may	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
bed	1
or	1
God	1
may	1
spare	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
battle,"	1
replied	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
deep	1
voice,	1
which	1
easily	1
carried	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"That's	1
true!"	1
	1
Once	1
more	1
the	1
conversations	1
concentrated,	1
the	1
ladies'	1
at	1
the	1
one	1
end	1
and	1
the	1
men's	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
ask,"	1
Natasha's	1
little	1
brother	1
was	1
saying;	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
won't	1
ask!"	1
	1
"I	1
will,"	1
replied	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Her	1
face	1
suddenly	1
flushed	1
with	1
reckless	1
and	1
joyous	1
resolution.	1
She	1
half	1
rose,	1
by	1
a	1
glance	1
inviting	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite,	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
coming,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
mother:	1
	1
"Mamma!"	1
rang	1
out	1
the	1
clear	1
contralto	1
notes	1
of	1
her	1
childish	1
voice,	1
audible	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess,	1
startled;	1
but	1
seeing	1
by	1
her	1
daughter's	1
face	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
mischief,	1
she	1
shook	1
a	1
finger	1
at	1
her	1
sternly	1
with	1
a	1
threatening	1
and	1
forbidding	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
hushed.	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
What	1
sweets	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
have?"	1
and	1
Natasha's	1
voice	1
sounded	1
still	1
more	1
firm	1
and	1
resolute.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
tried	1
to	1
frown,	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
shook	1
her	1
fat	1
finger.	1
	1
"Cossack!"	1
she	1
said	1
threateningly.	1
	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
guests,	1
uncertain	1
how	1
to	1
regard	1
this	1
sally,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
"You	1
had	1
better	1
take	1
care!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
What	1
sweets	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
have?"	1
Natasha	1
again	1
cried	1
boldly,	1
with	1
saucy	1
gaiety,	1
confident	1
that	1
her	1
prank	1
would	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
good	1
part.	1
	1
Sonya	1
and	1
fat	1
little	1
Petya	1
doubled	1
up	1
with	1
laughter.	1
	1
"You	1
see!	1
I	1
have	1
asked,"	1
whispered	1
Natasha	1
to	1
her	1
little	1
brother	1
and	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
glancing	1
at	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
"Ice	1
pudding,	1
but	1
you	1
won't	1
get	1
any,"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
Natasha	1
saw	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
braved	1
even	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
"Marya	1
Dmitrievna!	1
What	1
kind	1
of	1
ice	1
pudding?	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
ice	1
cream."	1
	1
"Carrot	1
ices."	1
	1
"No!	1
What	1
kind,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna?	1
What	1
kind?"	1
she	1
almost	1
screamed;	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
know!"	1
	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
joined	1
in.	1
Everyone	1
laughed,	1
not	1
at	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
answer	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
incredible	1
boldness	1
and	1
smartness	1
of	1
this	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
dared	1
to	1
treat	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
in	1
this	1
fashion.	1
	1
Natasha	1
only	1
desisted	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
pineapple	1
ice.	1
Before	1
the	1
ices,	1
champagne	1
was	1
served	1
round.	1
The	1
band	1
again	1
struck	1
up,	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
kissed,	1
and	1
the	1
guests,	1
leaving	1
their	1
seats,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
"congratulate"	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
reached	1
across	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
clink	1
glasses	1
with	1
the	1
count,	1
with	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
Again	1
the	1
footmen	1
rushed	1
about,	1
chairs	1
scraped,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
order	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
but	1
with	1
redder	1
faces,	1
the	1
guests	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
study.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
The	1
card	1
tables	1
were	1
drawn	1
out,	1
sets	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
boston,	1
and	1
the	1
count's	1
visitors	1
settled	1
themselves,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
drawing	1
rooms,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
library.	1
	1
The	1
count,	1
holding	1
his	1
cards	1
fanwise,	1
kept	1
himself	1
with	1
difficulty	1
from	1
dropping	1
into	1
his	1
usual	1
after-dinner	1
nap,	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
everything.	1
The	1
young	1
people,	1
at	1
the	1
countess'	1
instigation,	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
harp.	1
Julie	1
by	1
general	1
request	1
played	1
first.	1
After	1
she	1
had	1
played	1
a	1
little	1
air	1
with	1
variations	1
on	1
the	1
harp,	1
she	1
joined	1
the	1
other	1
young	1
ladies	1
in	1
begging	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
were	1
noted	1
for	1
their	1
musical	1
talent,	1
to	1
sing	1
something.	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
treated	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
grown	1
up,	1
was	1
evidently	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
felt	1
shy.	1
	1
"What	1
shall	1
we	1
sing?"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"'The	1
Brook,'"	1
suggested	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
let's	1
be	1
quick.	1
Boris,	1
come	1
here,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"But	1
where	1
is	1
Sonya?"	1
	1
She	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
her	1
friend	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
ran	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
Running	1
into	1
Sonya's	1
room	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
her	1
there,	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
nursery,	1
but	1
Sonya	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
either.	1
Natasha	1
concluded	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
chest	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
The	1
chest	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
was	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
mourning	1
for	1
the	1
younger	1
female	1
generation	1
in	1
the	1
Rostov	1
household.	1
And	1
there	1
in	1
fact	1
was	1
Sonya	1
lying	1
face	1
downward	1
on	1
Nurse's	1
dirty	1
feather	1
bed	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
chest,	1
crumpling	1
her	1
gauzy	1
pink	1
dress	1
under	1
her,	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
slender	1
fingers,	1
and	1
sobbing	1
so	1
convulsively	1
that	1
her	1
bare	1
little	1
shoulders	1
shook.	1
Natasha's	1
face,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
radiantly	1
happy	1
all	1
that	1
saint's	1
day,	1
suddenly	1
changed:	1
her	1
eyes	1
became	1
fixed,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
shiver	1
passed	1
down	1
her	1
broad	1
neck	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
her	1
mouth	1
drooped.	1
	1
"Sonya!	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
matter?...	1
Oo...	1
Oo...	1
Oo...!"	1
And	1
Natasha's	1
large	1
mouth	1
widened,	1
making	1
her	1
look	1
quite	1
ugly,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
wail	1
like	1
a	1
baby	1
without	1
knowing	1
why,	1
except	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
crying.	1
Sonya	1
tried	1
to	1
lift	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
answer	1
but	1
could	1
not,	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
still	1
deeper	1
in	1
the	1
bed.	1
Natasha	1
wept,	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
blue-striped	1
feather	1
bed	1
and	1
hugging	1
her	1
friend.	1
With	1
an	1
effort	1
Sonya	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
wiping	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
explaining.	1
	1
"Nicholas	1
is	1
going	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
week's	1
time,	1
his...	1
papers...	1
have	1
come...	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
himself...	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
cry,"	1
and	1
she	1
showed	1
a	1
paper	1
she	1
held	1
in	1
her	1
hand--with	1
the	1
verses	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
written,	1
"still,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
cry,	1
but	1
you	1
can't...	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
understand...	1
what	1
a	1
soul	1
he	1
has!"	1
	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
again	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
noble	1
soul.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you...	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
envious...	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
Boris	1
also,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
gaining	1
a	1
little	1
strength;	1
"he	1
is	1
nice...	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
difficulties	1
in	1
your	1
way....	1
But	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
my	1
cousin...	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
to...	1
the	1
Metropolitan	1
himself...	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
done.	1
And	1
besides,	1
if	1
she	1
tells	1
Mamma"	1
(Sonya	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
called	1
her	1
so)	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
spoiling	1
Nicholas'	1
career	1
and	1
am	1
heartless	1
and	1
ungrateful,	1
while	1
truly...	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,"	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross,	1
"I	1
love	1
her	1
so	1
much,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
you,	1
only	1
Vera...	1
And	1
what	1
for?	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
her?	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
willingly	1
sacrifice	1
everything,	1
only	1
I	1
have	1
nothing...."	1
	1
Sonya	1
could	1
not	1
continue,	1
and	1
again	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
feather	1
bed.	1
Natasha	1
began	1
consoling	1
her,	1
but	1
her	1
face	1
showed	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
her	1
friend's	1
trouble.	1
	1
"Sonya,"	1
she	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
guessed	1
the	1
true	1
reason	1
of	1
her	1
friend's	1
sorrow,	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
Vera	1
has	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
you	1
since	1
dinner?	1
Hasn't	1
she?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
these	1
verses	1
Nicholas	1
wrote	1
himself	1
and	1
I	1
copied	1
some	1
others,	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
them	1
on	1
my	1
table	1
and	1
said	1
she'd	1
show	1
them	1
to	1
Mamma,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
ungrateful,	1
and	1
that	1
Mamma	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
me,	1
but	1
that	1
he'll	1
marry	1
Julie.	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
he's	1
been	1
with	1
her	1
all	1
day...	1
Natasha,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
deserve	1
it?..."	1
	1
And	1
again	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
sob,	1
more	1
bitterly	1
than	1
before.	1
Natasha	1
lifted	1
her	1
up,	1
hugged	1
her,	1
and,	1
smiling	1
through	1
her	1
tears,	1
began	1
comforting	1
her.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
don't	1
believe	1
her,	1
darling!	1
Don't	1
believe	1
her!	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
and	1
Nicholas,	1
all	1
three	1
of	1
us,	1
talked	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
after	1
supper?	1
Why,	1
we	1
settled	1
how	1
everything	1
was	1
to	1
be.	1
I	1
don't	1
quite	1
remember	1
how,	1
but	1
don't	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
all	1
be	1
arranged	1
and	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
all	1
was?	1
There's	1
Uncle	1
Shinshin's	1
brother	1
has	1
married	1
his	1
first	1
cousin.	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
only	1
second	1
cousins,	1
you	1
know.	1
And	1
Boris	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
possible.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
clever	1
and	1
so	1
good!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
cry,	1
Sonya,	1
dear	1
love,	1
darling	1
Sonya!"	1
and	1
she	1
kissed	1
her	1
and	1
laughed.	1
"Vera's	1
spiteful;	1
never	1
mind	1
her!	1
And	1
all	1
will	1
come	1
right	1
and	1
she	1
won't	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
Mamma.	1
Nicholas	1
will	1
tell	1
her	1
himself,	1
and	1
he	1
doesn't	1
care	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
Julie."	1
	1
Natasha	1
kissed	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
hair.	1
	1
Sonya	1
sat	1
up.	1
The	1
little	1
kitten	1
brightened,	1
its	1
eyes	1
shone,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
ready	1
to	1
lift	1
its	1
tail,	1
jump	1
down	1
on	1
its	1
soft	1
paws,	1
and	1
begin	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
worsted	1
as	1
a	1
kitten	1
should.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
so?...	1
Really?	1
Truly?"	1
she	1
said,	1
quickly	1
smoothing	1
her	1
frock	1
and	1
hair.	1
	1
"Really,	1
truly!"	1
answered	1
Natasha,	1
pushing	1
in	1
a	1
crisp	1
lock	1
that	1
had	1
strayed	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
friend's	1
plaits.	1
	1
Both	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Well,	1
let's	1
go	1
and	1
sing	1
'The	1
Brook.'"	1
	1
"Come	1
along!"	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
fat	1
Pierre	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite	1
me	1
is	1
so	1
funny!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
stopping	1
suddenly.	1
"I	1
feel	1
so	1
happy!"	1
	1
And	1
she	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
run	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
	1
Sonya,	1
shaking	1
off	1
some	1
down	1
which	1
clung	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
tucking	1
away	1
the	1
verses	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
bony	1
little	1
chest,	1
ran	1
after	1
Natasha	1
down	1
the	1
passage	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
flushed	1
face	1
and	1
light,	1
joyous	1
steps.	1
At	1
the	1
visitors'	1
request	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
sang	1
the	1
quartette,	1
"The	1
Brook,"	1
with	1
which	1
everyone	1
was	1
delighted.	1
Then	1
Nicholas	1
sang	1
a	1
song	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
learned:	1
	1
	1
At	1
nighttime	1
in	1
the	1
moon's	1
fair	1
glow	1
How	1
sweet,	1
as	1
fancies	1
wander	1
free,	1
To	1
feel	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
there's	1
one	1
Who	1
still	1
is	1
thinking	1
but	1
of	1
thee!	1
	1
That	1
while	1
her	1
fingers	1
touch	1
the	1
harp	1
Wafting	1
sweet	1
music	1
o'er	1
the	1
lea,	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
thee	1
thus	1
swells	1
her	1
heart,	1
Sighing	1
its	1
message	1
out	1
to	1
thee...	1
	1
A	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
then	1
bliss	1
unspoilt,	1
But	1
oh!	1
till	1
then	1
I	1
cannot	1
live!...	1
	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
the	1
last	1
verse	1
before	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
to	1
dance	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
hall,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
coughing	1
of	1
the	1
musicians	1
were	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
gallery.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
where	1
Shinshin	1
had	1
engaged	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
recently	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad,	1
in	1
a	1
political	1
conversation	1
in	1
which	1
several	1
others	1
joined	1
but	1
which	1
bored	1
Pierre.	1
When	1
the	1
music	1
began	1
Natasha	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
walking	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
said,	1
laughing	1
and	1
blushing:	1
	1
"Mamma	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
dancers."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
mixing	1
the	1
figures,"	1
Pierre	1
replied;	1
"but	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
teacher..."	1
And	1
lowering	1
his	1
big	1
arm	1
he	1
offered	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
slender	1
little	1
girl.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
couples	1
were	1
arranging	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
musicians	1
tuning	1
up,	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
partner.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
perfectly	1
happy;	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
with	1
a	1
grown-up	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
abroad.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
conspicuous	1
place	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
grown-up	1
lady.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
fan	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
hold.	1
Assuming	1
quite	1
the	1
pose	1
of	1
a	1
society	1
woman	1
(heaven	1
knows	1
when	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
learned	1
it)	1
she	1
talked	1
with	1
her	1
partner,	1
fanning	1
herself	1
and	1
smiling	1
over	1
the	1
fan.	1
	1
"Dear,	1
dear!	1
Just	1
look	1
at	1
her!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
she	1
crossed	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Natasha	1
blushed	1
and	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
Mamma!	1
Why	1
should	1
you?	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
be	1
surprised	1
at?"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
ecossaise	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
clatter	1
of	1
chairs	1
being	1
pushed	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
had	1
been	1
playing	1
cards	1
with	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
distinguished	1
and	1
older	1
visitors.	1
They	1
now,	1
stretching	1
themselves	1
after	1
sitting	1
so	1
long,	1
and	1
replacing	1
their	1
purses	1
and	1
pocketbooks,	1
entered	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
First	1
came	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
and	1
the	1
count,	1
both	1
with	1
merry	1
countenances.	1
The	1
count,	1
with	1
playful	1
ceremony	1
somewhat	1
in	1
ballet	1
style,	1
offered	1
his	1
bent	1
arm	1
to	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
He	1
drew	1
himself	1
up,	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
debonair	1
gallantry	1
lit	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
ecossaise	1
was	1
ended,	1
he	1
clapped	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
musicians	1
and	1
shouted	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
gallery,	1
addressing	1
the	1
first	1
violin:	1
	1
"Semen!	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
Daniel	1
Cooper?"	1
	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
count's	1
favorite	1
dance,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
danced	1
in	1
his	1
youth.	1
(Strictly	1
speaking,	1
Daniel	1
Cooper	1
was	1
one	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
anglaise.)	1
	1
"Look	1
at	1
Papa!"	1
shouted	1
Natasha	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
company,	1
and	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
with	1
a	1
grown-up	1
partner	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
curly	1
head	1
to	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
ring	1
with	1
her	1
laughter.	1
	1
And	1
indeed	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
looked	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
jovial	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
standing	1
beside	1
his	1
tall	1
and	1
stout	1
partner,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
curved	1
his	1
arms,	1
beat	1
time,	1
straightened	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
turned	1
out	1
his	1
toes,	1
tapped	1
gently	1
with	1
his	1
foot,	1
and,	1
by	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
broadened	1
his	1
round	1
face	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
prepared	1
the	1
onlookers	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
follow.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
provocatively	1
gay	1
strains	1
of	1
Daniel	1
Cooper	1
(somewhat	1
resembling	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
merry	1
peasant	1
dance)	1
began	1
to	1
sound,	1
all	1
the	1
doorways	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom	1
were	1
suddenly	1
filled	1
by	1
the	1
domestic	1
serfs--the	1
men	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
on	1
the	1
other--who	1
with	1
beaming	1
faces	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
master	1
making	1
merry.	1
	1
"Just	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
master!	1
A	1
regular	1
eagle	1
he	1
is!"	1
loudly	1
remarked	1
the	1
nurse,	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doorways.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
danced	1
well	1
and	1
knew	1
it.	1
But	1
his	1
partner	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
dance	1
well.	1
Her	1
enormous	1
figure	1
stood	1
erect,	1
her	1
powerful	1
arms	1
hanging	1
down	1
(she	1
had	1
handed	1
her	1
reticule	1
to	1
the	1
countess),	1
and	1
only	1
her	1
stern	1
but	1
handsome	1
face	1
really	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
dance.	1
What	1
was	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
plump	1
figure,	1
in	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
found	1
expression	1
only	1
in	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
beaming	1
face	1
and	1
quivering	1
nose.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
count,	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
swing	1
of	1
it,	1
charmed	1
the	1
spectators	1
by	1
the	1
unexpectedness	1
of	1
his	1
adroit	1
maneuvers	1
and	1
the	1
agility	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
capered	1
about	1
on	1
his	1
light	1
feet,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
produced	1
no	1
less	1
impression	1
by	1
slight	1
exertions--the	1
least	1
effort	1
to	1
move	1
her	1
shoulders	1
or	1
bend	1
her	1
arms	1
when	1
turning,	1
or	1
stamp	1
her	1
foot--	1
which	1
everyone	1
appreciated	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
her	1
size	1
and	1
habitual	1
severity.	1
The	1
dance	1
grew	1
livelier	1
and	1
livelier.	1
The	1
other	1
couples	1
could	1
not	1
attract	1
a	1
moment's	1
attention	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
evolutions	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
All	1
were	1
watching	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
Natasha	1
kept	1
pulling	1
everyone	1
by	1
sleeve	1
or	1
dress,	1
urging	1
them	1
to	1
"look	1
at	1
Papa!"	1
though	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
never	1
took	1
their	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
couple.	1
In	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
the	1
dance	1
the	1
count,	1
breathing	1
deeply,	1
waved	1
and	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
musicians	1
to	1
play	1
faster.	1
Faster,	1
faster,	1
and	1
faster;	1
lightly,	1
more	1
lightly,	1
and	1
yet	1
more	1
lightly	1
whirled	1
the	1
count,	1
flying	1
round	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
toes,	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
heels;	1
until,	1
turning	1
his	1
partner	1
round	1
to	1
her	1
seat,	1
he	1
executed	1
the	1
final	1
pas,	1
raising	1
his	1
soft	1
foot	1
backwards,	1
bowing	1
his	1
perspiring	1
head,	1
smiling	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
wide	1
sweep	1
with	1
his	1
arm,	1
amid	1
a	1
thunder	1
of	1
applause	1
and	1
laughter	1
led	1
by	1
Natasha.	1
Both	1
partners	1
stood	1
still,	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
and	1
wiping	1
their	1
faces	1
with	1
their	1
cambric	1
handkerchiefs.	1
	1
"That's	1
how	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
dance	1
in	1
our	1
time,	1
ma	1
chere,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
a	1
Daniel	1
Cooper!"	1
exclaimed	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
tucking	1
up	1
her	1
sleeves	1
and	1
puffing	1
heavily.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
While	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
ballroom	1
the	1
sixth	1
anglaise	1
was	1
being	1
danced,	1
to	1
a	1
tune	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
weary	1
musicians	1
blundered,	1
and	1
while	1
tired	1
footmen	1
and	1
cooks	1
were	1
getting	1
the	1
supper,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
had	1
a	1
sixth	1
stroke.	1
The	1
doctors	1
pronounced	1
recovery	1
impossible.	1
After	1
a	1
mute	1
confession,	1
communion	1
was	1
administered	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
preparations	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
sacrament	1
of	1
unction,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
bustle	1
and	1
thrill	1
of	1
suspense	1
usual	1
at	1
such	1
moments.	1
Outside	1
the	1
house,	1
beyond	1
the	1
gates,	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
undertakers,	1
who	1
hid	1
whenever	1
a	1
carriage	1
drove	1
up,	1
waited	1
in	1
expectation	1
of	1
an	1
important	1
order	1
for	1
an	1
expensive	1
funeral.	1
The	1
Military	1
Governor	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
assiduous	1
in	1
sending	1
aides-de-camp	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
the	1
count's	1
health,	1
came	1
himself	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
bid	1
a	1
last	1
farewell	1
to	1
the	1
celebrated	1
grandee	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
court,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov.	1
	1
The	1
magnificent	1
reception	1
room	1
was	1
crowded.	1
Everyone	1
stood	1
up	1
respectfully	1
when	1
the	1
Military	1
Governor,	1
having	1
stayed	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
passed	1
out,	1
slightly	1
acknowledging	1
their	1
bows	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
escape	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
the	1
glances	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
doctors,	1
clergy,	1
and	1
relatives	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
thinner	1
and	1
paler	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days,	1
escorted	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
repeating	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
low	1
tones.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
Military	1
Governor	1
had	1
gone,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sat	1
down	1
all	1
alone	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
crossing	1
one	1
leg	1
high	1
over	1
the	1
other,	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbow	1
on	1
his	1
knee	1
and	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
After	1
sitting	1
so	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
rose,	1
and,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes,	1
went	1
with	1
unusually	1
hurried	1
steps	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
corridor	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess.	1
	1
Those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
dimly	1
lit	1
reception	1
room	1
spoke	1
in	1
nervous	1
whispers,	1
and,	1
whenever	1
anyone	1
went	1
into	1
or	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
dying	1
man's	1
room,	1
grew	1
silent	1
and	1
gazed	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
curiosity	1
or	1
expectancy	1
at	1
his	1
door,	1
which	1
creaked	1
slightly	1
when	1
opened.	1
	1
"The	1
limits	1
of	1
human	1
life...	1
are	1
fixed	1
and	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
o'erpassed,"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
priest	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
listening	1
naively	1
to	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
"I	1
wonder,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
administer	1
unction?"	1
asked	1
the	1
lady,	1
adding	1
the	1
priest's	1
clerical	1
title,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
opinion	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
madam,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
sacrament,"	1
replied	1
the	1
priest,	1
passing	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
thin	1
grizzled	1
strands	1
of	1
hair	1
combed	1
back	1
across	1
his	1
bald	1
head.	1
	1
"Who	1
was	1
that?	1
The	1
Military	1
Governor	1
himself?"	1
was	1
being	1
asked	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
"How	1
young-looking	1
he	1
is!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
over	1
sixty.	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
count	1
no	1
longer	1
recognizes	1
anyone.	1
They	1
wished	1
to	1
administer	1
the	1
sacrament	1
of	1
unction."	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
someone	1
who	1
received	1
that	1
sacrament	1
seven	1
times."	1
	1
The	1
second	1
princess	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
sickroom	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
red	1
from	1
weeping	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
Dr.	1
Lorrain,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
graceful	1
pose	1
under	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
Catherine,	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbow	1
on	1
a	1
table.	1
	1
"Beautiful,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
remark	1
about	1
the	1
weather.	1
"The	1
weather	1
is	1
beautiful,	1
Princess;	1
and	1
besides,	1
in	1
Moscow	1
one	1
feels	1
as	1
if	1
one	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
country."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"So	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
drink?"	1
	1
Lorrain	1
considered.	1
	1
"Has	1
he	1
taken	1
his	1
medicine?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
	1
"Take	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
boiled	1
water	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
pinch	1
of	1
cream	1
of	1
tartar,"	1
and	1
he	1
indicated	1
with	1
his	1
delicate	1
fingers	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
a	1
pinch.	1
	1
"Dere	1
has	1
neffer	1
been	1
a	1
gase,"	1
a	1
German	1
doctor	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
an	1
aide-de-	1
camp,	1
"dat	1
one	1
liffs	1
after	1
de	1
sird	1
stroke."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
a	1
well-preserved	1
man	1
he	1
was!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
aide-de-camp.	1
"And	1
who	1
will	1
inherit	1
his	1
wealth?"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
"It	1
von't	1
go	1
begging,"	1
replied	1
the	1
German	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Everyone	1
again	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
door,	1
which	1
creaked	1
as	1
the	1
second	1
princess	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
drink	1
she	1
had	1
prepared	1
according	1
to	1
Lorrain's	1
instructions.	1
The	1
German	1
doctor	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Lorrain.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
can	1
last	1
till	1
morning?"	1
asked	1
the	1
German,	1
addressing	1
Lorrain	1
in	1
French	1
which	1
he	1
pronounced	1
badly.	1
	1
Lorrain,	1
pursing	1
up	1
his	1
lips,	1
waved	1
a	1
severely	1
negative	1
finger	1
before	1
his	1
nose.	1
	1
"Tonight,	1
not	1
later,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
decorous	1
smile	1
of	1
self-satisfaction	1
at	1
being	1
able	1
clearly	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
state	1
the	1
patient's	1
condition.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
princess'	1
room.	1
	1
In	1
this	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
dark;	1
only	1
two	1
tiny	1
lamps	1
were	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
icons	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
pleasant	1
scent	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
burnt	1
pastilles.	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
crowded	1
with	1
small	1
pieces	1
of	1
furniture,	1
whatnots,	1
cupboards,	1
and	1
little	1
tables.	1
The	1
quilt	1
of	1
a	1
high,	1
white	1
feather	1
bed	1
was	1
just	1
visible	1
behind	1
a	1
screen.	1
A	1
small	1
dog	1
began	1
to	1
bark.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
is	1
it	1
you,	1
cousin?"	1
	1
She	1
rose	1
and	1
smoothed	1
her	1
hair,	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
usual	1
so	1
extremely	1
smooth	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
one	1
piece	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
varnish.	1
	1
"Has	1
anything	1
happened?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
terrified."	1
	1
"No,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
change.	1
I	1
only	1
came	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
about	1
business,	1
Catiche,"	1
*	1
muttered	1
the	1
prince,	1
seating	1
himself	1
wearily	1
on	1
the	1
chair	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
vacated.	1
"You	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
place	1
warm,	1
I	1
must	1
say,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"Well,	1
sit	1
down:	1
let's	1
have	1
a	1
talk."	1
	1
	1
*Catherine.	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
perhaps	1
something	1
had	1
happened,"	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
her	1
unchanging	1
stonily	1
severe	1
expression;	1
and,	1
sitting	1
down	1
opposite	1
the	1
prince,	1
she	1
prepared	1
to	1
listen.	1
	1
"I	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
nap,	1
mon	1
cousin,	1
but	1
I	1
can't."	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
bending	1
it	1
downwards	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
habit.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
this	1
"well?"	1
referred	1
to	1
much	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
understood	1
without	1
naming.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
straight,	1
rigid	1
body,	1
abnormally	1
long	1
for	1
her	1
legs,	1
looked	1
directly	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
with	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
emotion	1
in	1
her	1
prominent	1
gray	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
icons	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
This	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
devotion,	1
or	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
hope	1
of	1
resting	1
before	1
long.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
understood	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
weariness.	1
	1
"And	1
I?"	1
he	1
said;	1
"do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
me?	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
worn	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
post	1
horse,	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
you,	1
Catiche,	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
talk."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
his	1
cheeks	1
began	1
to	1
twitch	1
nervously,	1
now	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
giving	1
his	1
face	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
expression	1
which	1
was	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
on	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
drawing	1
room.	1
His	1
eyes	1
too	1
seemed	1
strange;	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
they	1
looked	1
impudently	1
sly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
glanced	1
round	1
in	1
alarm.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
holding	1
her	1
little	1
dog	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
bony	1
hands,	1
looked	1
attentively	1
into	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
eyes	1
evidently	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
break	1
silence,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
morning.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
my	1
dear	1
princess	1
and	1
cousin,	1
Catherine	1
Semenovna,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
theme,	1
apparently	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
inner	1
struggle;	1
"at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
this	1
one	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
everything.	1
One	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
future,	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
you...	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
all,	1
like	1
children	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
as	1
you	1
know."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
moving,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
dull	1
expression.	1
	1
"And	1
then	1
of	1
course	1
my	1
family	1
has	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
considered,"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
went	1
on,	1
testily	1
pushing	1
away	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her.	1
"You	1
know,	1
Catiche,	1
that	1
we--you	1
three	1
sisters,	1
Mamontov,	1
and	1
my	1
wife--	1
are	1
the	1
count's	1
only	1
direct	1
heirs.	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
matters.	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
easier	1
for	1
me;	1
but,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
getting	1
on	1
for	1
sixty	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
anything.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
Pierre?	1
The	1
count,"	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
portrait,	1
"definitely	1
demanded	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
called."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
the	1
princess,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
considering	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
or	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
simply	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
constantly	1
pray	1
God	1
to	1
grant,	1
mon	1
cousin,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
"and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
He	1
would	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
allow	1
his	1
noble	1
soul	1
peacefully	1
to	1
leave	1
this..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course,"	1
interrupted	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
impatiently,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
and	1
angrily	1
pulling	1
back	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
pushed	1
away.	1
"But...	1
in	1
short,	1
the	1
fact	1
is...	1
you	1
know	1
yourself	1
that	1
last	1
winter	1
the	1
count	1
made	1
a	1
will	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
left	1
all	1
his	1
property,	1
not	1
to	1
us	1
his	1
direct	1
heirs,	1
but	1
to	1
Pierre."	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
made	1
wills	1
enough!"	1
quietly	1
remarked	1
the	1
princess.	1
"But	1
he	1
cannot	1
leave	1
the	1
estate	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
Pierre	1
is	1
illegitimate."	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
suddenly,	1
clutching	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
and	1
becoming	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
talking	1
more	1
rapidly:	1
"what	1
if	1
a	1
letter	1
has	1
been	1
written	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
count	1
asks	1
for	1
Pierre's	1
legitimation?	1
Do	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
in	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
services,	1
his	1
request	1
would	1
be	1
granted?..."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
smiled	1
as	1
people	1
do	1
who	1
think	1
they	1
know	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
subject	1
under	1
discussion	1
than	1
those	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
with.	1
	1
"I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
more,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
seizing	1
her	1
hand,	1
"that	1
letter	1
was	1
written,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
sent,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
knew	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
only	1
question	1
is,	1
has	1
it	1
been	1
destroyed	1
or	1
not?	1
If	1
not,	1
then	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
all	1
is	1
over,"	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sighed	1
to	1
intimate	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
all	1
is	1
over,	1
"and	1
the	1
count's	1
papers	1
are	1
opened,	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
will	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
the	1
petition	1
will	1
certainly	1
be	1
granted.	1
Pierre	1
will	1
get	1
everything	1
as	1
the	1
legitimate	1
son."	1
	1
"And	1
our	1
share?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess	1
smiling	1
ironically,	1
as	1
if	1
anything	1
might	1
happen,	1
only	1
not	1
that.	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
poor	1
Catiche,	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
daylight!	1
He	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
the	1
legal	1
heir	1
to	1
everything	1
and	1
you	1
won't	1
get	1
anything.	1
You	1
must	1
know,	1
my	1
dear,	1
whether	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
were	1
written,	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
or	1
not.	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
somehow	1
been	1
overlooked,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
are,	1
and	1
must	1
find	1
them,	1
because..."	1
	1
"What	1
next?"	1
the	1
princess	1
interrupted,	1
smiling	1
sardonically	1
and	1
not	1
changing	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
stupid;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
this:	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
cannot	1
inherit...	1
un	1
batard!"	1
*	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
supposing	1
that	1
this	1
translation	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
would	1
effectively	1
prove	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
the	1
invalidity	1
of	1
his	1
contention.	1
	1
	1
*	1
A	1
bastard.	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
Catiche!	1
Can't	1
you	1
understand!	1
You	1
are	1
so	1
intelligent,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don't	1
see	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
begging	1
him	1
to	1
recognize	1
Pierre	1
as	1
legitimate,	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
Pierre	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
Pierre	1
but	1
will	1
become	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
will	1
then	1
inherit	1
everything	1
under	1
the	1
will?	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
are	1
not	1
destroyed,	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
dutiful	1
et	1
tout	1
ce	1
qui	1
s'ensuit!	1
*	1
That's	1
certain."	1
	1
	1
*	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
follows	1
therefrom.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
the	1
will	1
was	1
made,	1
but	1
I	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
invalid;	1
and	1
you,	1
mon	1
cousin,	1
seem	1
to	1
consider	1
me	1
a	1
perfect	1
fool,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
women	1
assume	1
when	1
they	1
suppose	1
they	1
are	1
saying	1
something	1
witty	1
and	1
stinging.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Princess	1
Catherine	1
Semenovna,"	1
began	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
impatiently,	1
"I	1
came	1
here	1
not	1
to	1
wrangle	1
with	1
you,	1
but	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
your	1
interests	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
kinswoman,	1
a	1
good,	1
kind,	1
true	1
relation.	1
And	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
tenth	1
time	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
the	1
will	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
favor	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
count's	1
papers,	1
then,	1
my	1
dear	1
girl,	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
sisters	1
are	1
not	1
heiresses!	1
If	1
you	1
don't	1
believe	1
me,	1
then	1
believe	1
an	1
expert.	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
Dmitri	1
Onufrich"	1
(the	1
family	1
solicitor)	1
"and	1
he	1
says	1
the	1
same."	1
	1
At	1
this	1
a	1
sudden	1
change	1
evidently	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
princess'	1
ideas;	1
her	1
thin	1
lips	1
grew	1
white,	1
though	1
her	1
eyes	1
did	1
not	1
change,	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
passed	1
through	1
such	1
transitions	1
as	1
she	1
herself	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
expect.	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
fine	1
thing!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
never	1
wanted	1
anything	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
now."	1
	1
She	1
pushed	1
the	1
little	1
dog	1
off	1
her	1
lap	1
and	1
smoothed	1
her	1
dress.	1
	1
"And	1
this	1
is	1
gratitude--this	1
is	1
recognition	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
for	1
his	1
sake!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"It's	1
splendid!	1
Fine!	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
anything,	1
Prince."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
one.	1
There	1
are	1
your	1
sisters..."	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
long	1
ago	1
but	1
had	1
forgotten.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
expect	1
nothing	1
but	1
meanness,	1
deceit,	1
envy,	1
intrigue,	1
and	1
ingratitude--the	1
blackest	1
ingratitude--in	1
this	1
house..."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
that	1
will	1
is?"	1
insisted	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
his	1
cheeks	1
twitching	1
more	1
than	1
ever.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
fool!	1
I	1
still	1
believed	1
in	1
people,	1
loved	1
them,	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
myself.	1
But	1
only	1
the	1
base,	1
the	1
vile	1
succeed!	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
intriguing!"	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
wished	1
to	1
rise,	1
but	1
the	1
prince	1
held	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
suddenly	1
lost	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race.	1
She	1
gave	1
her	1
companion	1
an	1
angry	1
glance.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
still	1
time,	1
my	1
dear.	1
You	1
must	1
remember,	1
Catiche,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
casually	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
anger,	1
of	1
illness,	1
and	1
was	1
afterwards	1
forgotten.	1
Our	1
duty,	1
my	1
dear,	1
is	1
to	1
rectify	1
his	1
mistake,	1
to	1
ease	1
his	1
last	1
moments	1
by	1
not	1
letting	1
him	1
commit	1
this	1
injustice,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
rendering	1
unhappy	1
those	1
who..."	1
	1
"Who	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
for	1
him,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
princess,	1
who	1
would	1
again	1
have	1
risen	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
prince	1
still	1
held	1
her	1
fast,	1
"though	1
he	1
never	1
could	1
appreciate	1
it.	1
No,	1
mon	1
cousin,"	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
"I	1
shall	1
always	1
remember	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
one	1
must	1
expect	1
no	1
reward,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
honor	1
nor	1
justice.	1
In	1
this	1
world	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
cunning	1
and	1
cruel."	1
	1
"Now	1
come,	1
come!	1
Be	1
reasonable.	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
excellent	1
heart."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
wicked	1
heart."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
your	1
heart,"	1
repeated	1
the	1
prince.	1
"I	1
value	1
your	1
friendship	1
and	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
as	1
good	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
me.	1
Don't	1
upset	1
yourself,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
sensibly	1
while	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
time,	1
be	1
it	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
be	1
it	1
but	1
an	1
hour....	1
Tell	1
me	1
all	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
the	1
will,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
where	1
it	1
is.	1
You	1
must	1
know.	1
We	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
He	1
has,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
forgotten	1
it	1
and	1
will	1
wish	1
to	1
destroy	1
it.	1
You	1
understand	1
that	1
my	1
sole	1
desire	1
is	1
conscientiously	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
wishes;	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
only	1
reason	1
for	1
being	1
here.	1
I	1
came	1
simply	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
and	1
you."	1
	1
"Now	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
all!	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
intriguing--I	1
know!"	1
cried	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
the	1
point,	1
my	1
dear."	1
	1
"It's	1
that	1
protege	1
of	1
yours,	1
that	1
sweet	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya,	1
that	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
whom	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
for	1
a	1
housemaid...	1
the	1
infamous,	1
vile	1
woman!"	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
lose	1
any	1
time..."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
don't	1
talk	1
to	1
me!	1
Last	1
winter	1
she	1
wheedled	1
herself	1
in	1
here	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
count	1
such	1
vile,	1
disgraceful	1
things	1
about	1
us,	1
especially	1
about	1
Sophie--I	1
can't	1
repeat	1
them--that	1
it	1
made	1
the	1
count	1
quite	1
ill	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
us	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
fortnight.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
he	1
wrote	1
this	1
vile,	1
infamous	1
paper,	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
invalid."	1
	1
"We've	1
got	1
to	1
it	1
at	1
last--why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
it	1
sooner?"	1
	1
"It's	1
in	1
the	1
inlaid	1
portfolio	1
that	1
he	1
keeps	1
under	1
his	1
pillow,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
ignoring	1
his	1
question.	1
"Now	1
I	1
know!	1
Yes;	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
sin,	1
a	1
great	1
sin,	1
it	1
is	1
hatred	1
of	1
that	1
vile	1
woman!"	1
almost	1
shrieked	1
the	1
princess,	1
now	1
quite	1
changed.	1
"And	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
come	1
worming	1
herself	1
in	1
here	1
for?	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
my	1
mind.	1
The	1
time	1
will	1
come!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXII	1
	1
While	1
these	1
conversations	1
were	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
princess'	1
room,	1
a	1
carriage	1
containing	1
Pierre	1
(who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
for)	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
(who	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
accompany	1
him)	1
was	1
driving	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
house.	1
As	1
the	1
wheels	1
rolled	1
softly	1
over	1
the	1
straw	1
beneath	1
the	1
windows,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
having	1
turned	1
with	1
words	1
of	1
comfort	1
to	1
her	1
companion,	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asleep	1
in	1
his	1
corner	1
and	1
woke	1
him	1
up.	1
Rousing	1
himself,	1
Pierre	1
followed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
dying	1
father	1
which	1
awaited	1
him.	1
He	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
entrance	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
door.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
steps	1
two	1
men,	1
who	1
looked	1
like	1
tradespeople,	1
ran	1
hurriedly	1
from	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
wall.	1
Pausing	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
several	1
other	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
both	1
sides.	1
But	1
neither	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
nor	1
the	1
footman	1
nor	1
the	1
coachman,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
these	1
people,	1
took	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
them.	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
right,"	1
Pierre	1
concluded,	1
and	1
followed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
She	1
hurriedly	1
ascended	1
the	1
narrow	1
dimly	1
lit	1
stone	1
staircase,	1
calling	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
was	1
lagging	1
behind,	1
to	1
follow.	1
Though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
all,	1
still	1
less	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
stairs,	1
yet	1
judging	1
by	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
air	1
of	1
assurance	1
and	1
haste,	1
Pierre	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
absolutely	1
necessary.	1
Halfway	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
they	1
were	1
almost	1
knocked	1
over	1
by	1
some	1
men	1
who,	1
carrying	1
pails,	1
came	1
running	1
downstairs,	1
their	1
boots	1
clattering.	1
These	1
men	1
pressed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
to	1
let	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
pass	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
evince	1
the	1
least	1
surprise	1
at	1
seeing	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
"Is	1
this	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
princesses'	1
apartments?"	1
asked	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
a	1
footman	1
in	1
a	1
bold	1
loud	1
voice,	1
as	1
if	1
anything	1
were	1
now	1
permissible;	1
"the	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
ma'am."	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
the	1
count	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
landing.	1
"I'd	1
better	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
room."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
paused	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
up.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
friend!"	1
she	1
said,	1
touching	1
his	1
arm	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
son's	1
when	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
afternoon,	1
"believe	1
me	1
I	1
suffer	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
you	1
do,	1
but	1
be	1
a	1
man!"	1
	1
"But	1
really,	1
hadn't	1
I	1
better	1
go	1
away?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
looking	1
kindly	1
at	1
her	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend!	1
Forget	1
the	1
wrongs	1
that	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
you.	1
Think	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
father...	1
perhaps	1
in	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
death."	1
She	1
sighed.	1
"I	1
have	1
loved	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
son	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
Trust	1
yourself	1
to	1
me,	1
Pierre.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
forget	1
your	1
interests."	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
a	1
word,	1
but	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
grew	1
stronger,	1
and	1
he	1
meekly	1
followed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
opening	1
a	1
door.	1
	1
This	1
door	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
back	1
anteroom.	1
An	1
old	1
man,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
princesses,	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
knitting	1
a	1
stocking.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
these	1
rooms.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
addressing	1
a	1
maid	1
who	1
was	1
hurrying	1
past	1
with	1
a	1
decanter	1
on	1
a	1
tray	1
as	1
"my	1
dear"	1
and	1
"my	1
sweet,"	1
asked	1
about	1
the	1
princess'	1
health	1
and	1
then	1
led	1
Pierre	1
along	1
a	1
stone	1
passage.	1
The	1
first	1
door	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
princesses'	1
apartments.	1
The	1
maid	1
with	1
the	1
decanter	1
in	1
her	1
haste	1
had	1
not	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
(everything	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
haste	1
at	1
that	1
time),	1
and	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
in	1
passing	1
instinctively	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
where	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
were	1
sitting	1
close	1
together	1
talking.	1
Seeing	1
them	1
pass,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
drew	1
back	1
with	1
obvious	1
impatience,	1
while	1
the	1
princess	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
desperation	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might.	1
	1
This	1
action	1
was	1
so	1
unlike	1
her	1
usual	1
composure	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
depicted	1
on	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
face	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
dignity	1
that	1
Pierre	1
stopped	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
at	1
his	1
guide.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
evinced	1
no	1
surprise,	1
she	1
only	1
smiled	1
faintly	1
and	1
sighed,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
expected.	1
	1
"Be	1
a	1
man,	1
my	1
friend.	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
after	1
your	1
interests,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
look,	1
and	1
went	1
still	1
faster	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about,	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
what	1
"watching	1
over	1
his	1
interests"	1
meant,	1
but	1
he	1
decided	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
had	1
to	1
be.	1
From	1
the	1
passage	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
large,	1
dimly	1
lit	1
room	1
adjoining	1
the	1
count's	1
reception	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
sumptuous	1
but	1
cold	1
apartments	1
known	1
to	1
Pierre	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
approach,	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
there	1
now	1
stood	1
an	1
empty	1
bath,	1
and	1
water	1
had	1
been	1
spilled	1
on	1
the	1
carpet.	1
They	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
deacon	1
with	1
a	1
censer	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
servant	1
who	1
passed	1
out	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
without	1
heeding	1
them.	1
They	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
familiar	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
two	1
Italian	1
windows	1
opening	1
into	1
the	1
conservatory,	1
with	1
its	1
large	1
bust	1
and	1
full	1
length	1
portrait	1
of	1
Catherine	1
the	1
Great.	1
The	1
same	1
people	1
were	1
still	1
sitting	1
here	1
in	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
positions	1
as	1
before,	1
whispering	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
All	1
became	1
silent	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
pale	1
tear-worn	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
as	1
she	1
entered,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
big	1
stout	1
figure	1
of	1
Pierre	1
who,	1
hanging	1
his	1
head,	1
meekly	1
followed	1
her.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
face	1
expressed	1
a	1
consciousness	1
that	1
the	1
decisive	1
moment	1
had	1
arrived.	1
With	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
practical	1
Petersburg	1
lady	1
she	1
now,	1
keeping	1
Pierre	1
close	1
beside	1
her,	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
even	1
more	1
boldly	1
than	1
that	1
afternoon.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
as	1
she	1
brought	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
person	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
wished	1
to	1
see,	1
her	1
own	1
admission	1
was	1
assured.	1
Casting	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
at	1
all	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
noticing	1
the	1
count's	1
confessor	1
there,	1
she	1
glided	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
amble,	1
not	1
exactly	1
bowing	1
yet	1
seeming	1
to	1
grow	1
suddenly	1
smaller,	1
and	1
respectfully	1
received	1
the	1
blessing	1
first	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
another	1
priest.	1
	1
"God	1
be	1
thanked	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
time,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
priests;	1
"all	1
we	1
relatives	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
such	1
anxiety.	1
This	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
count's	1
son,"	1
she	1
added	1
more	1
softly.	1
"What	1
a	1
terrible	1
moment!"	1
	1
Having	1
said	1
this	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
"Dear	1
doctor,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"this	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
count's	1
son.	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
hope?"	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
cast	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
upwards	1
and	1
silently	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
movement	1
raised	1
her	1
shoulders	1
and	1
eyes,	1
almost	1
closing	1
the	1
latter,	1
sighed,	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
To	1
him,	1
in	1
a	1
particularly	1
respectful	1
and	1
tenderly	1
sad	1
voice,	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"Trust	1
in	1
His	1
mercy!"	1
and	1
pointing	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
sofa	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
sit	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
her,	1
she	1
went	1
silently	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
watching	1
and	1
it	1
creaked	1
very	1
slightly	1
as	1
she	1
disappeared	1
behind	1
it.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
monitress	1
implicitly,	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
sofa	1
she	1
had	1
indicated.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
had	1
disappeared	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
curiosity	1
and	1
sympathy.	1
He	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
whispered	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
casting	1
significant	1
looks	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
awe	1
and	1
even	1
servility.	1
A	1
deference	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
received	1
was	1
shown	1
him.	1
A	1
strange	1
lady,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
rose	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
her	1
seat;	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
picked	1
up	1
and	1
returned	1
a	1
glove	1
Pierre	1
had	1
dropped;	1
the	1
doctors	1
became	1
respectfully	1
silent	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
him.	1
At	1
first	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
another	1
seat	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
trouble	1
the	1
lady,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
glove	1
himself	1
and	1
to	1
pass	1
round	1
the	1
doctors	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
way;	1
but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
do,	1
and	1
that	1
tonight	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
obliged	1
to	1
perform	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
awful	1
rite	1
which	1
everyone	1
expected	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
therefore	1
bound	1
to	1
accept	1
their	1
services.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
glove	1
in	1
silence	1
from	1
the	1
aide-de-	1
camp,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
lady's	1
chair,	1
placing	1
his	1
huge	1
hands	1
symmetrically	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
in	1
the	1
naive	1
attitude	1
of	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
statue,	1
and	1
decided	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
do	1
foolish	1
things	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
act	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
ideas	1
tonight,	1
but	1
must	1
yield	1
himself	1
up	1
entirely	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
guiding	1
him.	1
	1
Not	1
two	1
minutes	1
had	1
passed	1
before	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
with	1
head	1
erect	1
majestically	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
was	1
wearing	1
his	1
long	1
coat	1
with	1
three	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
grown	1
thinner	1
since	1
the	1
morning;	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
larger	1
than	1
usual	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
and	1
noticed	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
(a	1
thing	1
he	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
do),	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
downwards	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
firmly	1
fixed	1
on.	1
	1
"Courage,	1
courage,	1
my	1
friend!	1
He	1
has	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
you.	1
That	1
is	1
well!"	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
But	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
ask:	1
"How	1
is..."	1
and	1
hesitated,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
"the	1
count,"	1
yet	1
ashamed	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
"father."	1
	1
"He	1
had	1
another	1
stroke	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago.	1
Courage,	1
my	1
friend..."	1
	1
Pierre's	1
mind	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
confused	1
state	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
"stroke"	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
blow	1
from	1
something.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
perplexity,	1
and	1
only	1
later	1
grasped	1
that	1
a	1
stroke	1
was	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
illness.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
Lorrain	1
in	1
passing	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
tiptoe.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
walk	1
well	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
jerked	1
at	1
each	1
step.	1
The	1
eldest	1
princess	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
deacons	1
and	1
some	1
servants	1
also	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Through	1
that	1
door	1
was	1
heard	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
things	1
being	1
moved	1
about,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression,	1
pale	1
but	1
resolute	1
in	1
the	1
discharge	1
of	1
duty,	1
ran	1
out	1
and	1
touching	1
Pierre	1
lightly	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
said:	1
	1
"The	1
divine	1
mercy	1
is	1
inexhaustible!	1
Unction	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
administered.	1
Come."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
stepping	1
on	1
the	1
soft	1
carpet,	1
and	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
strange	1
lady,	1
the	1
aide-de-camp,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
all	1
followed	1
him	1
in,	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
no	1
further	1
need	1
for	1
permission	1
to	1
enter	1
that	1
room.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXIII	1
	1
Pierre	1
well	1
knew	1
this	1
large	1
room	1
divided	1
by	1
columns	1
and	1
an	1
arch,	1
its	1
walls	1
hung	1
round	1
with	1
Persian	1
carpets.	1
The	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
behind	1
the	1
columns,	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
silk-curtained	1
mahogany	1
bedstead	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
an	1
immense	1
case	1
containing	1
icons,	1
was	1
brightly	1
illuminated	1
with	1
red	1
light	1
like	1
a	1
Russian	1
church	1
during	1
evening	1
service.	1
Under	1
the	1
gleaming	1
icons	1
stood	1
a	1
long	1
invalid	1
chair,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
chair	1
on	1
snowy-	1
white	1
smooth	1
pillows,	1
evidently	1
freshly	1
changed,	1
Pierre	1
saw--covered	1
to	1
the	1
waist	1
by	1
a	1
bright	1
green	1
quilt--the	1
familiar,	1
majestic	1
figure	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
with	1
that	1
gray	1
mane	1
of	1
hair	1
above	1
his	1
broad	1
forehead	1
which	1
reminded	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
characteristically	1
noble	1
wrinkles	1
of	1
his	1
handsome,	1
ruddy	1
face.	1
He	1
lay	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
icons;	1
his	1
large	1
thick	1
hands	1
outside	1
the	1
quilt.	1
Into	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
which	1
was	1
lying	1
palm	1
downwards,	1
a	1
wax	1
taper	1
had	1
been	1
thrust	1
between	1
forefinger	1
and	1
thumb,	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
servant,	1
bending	1
over	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
chair,	1
held	1
it	1
in	1
position.	1
By	1
the	1
chair	1
stood	1
the	1
priests,	1
their	1
long	1
hair	1
falling	1
over	1
their	1
magnificent	1
glittering	1
vestments,	1
with	1
lighted	1
tapers	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
slowly	1
and	1
solemnly	1
conducting	1
the	1
service.	1
A	1
little	1
behind	1
them	1
stood	1
the	1
two	1
younger	1
princesses	1
holding	1
handkerchiefs	1
to	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
their	1
eldest	1
sister,	1
Catiche,	1
with	1
a	1
vicious	1
and	1
determined	1
look	1
steadily	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
icons,	1
as	1
though	1
declaring	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
for	1
herself	1
should	1
she	1
glance	1
round.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
a	1
meek,	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
all-forgiving	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
near	1
the	1
strange	1
lady.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
near	1
the	1
invalid	1
chair,	1
a	1
wax	1
taper	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand,	1
was	1
leaning	1
his	1
left	1
arm	1
on	1
the	1
carved	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
velvet	1
chair	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
purpose,	1
and	1
was	1
crossing	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
turning	1
his	1
eyes	1
upward	1
each	1
time	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
forehead.	1
His	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
calm	1
look	1
of	1
piety	1
and	1
resignation	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
"If	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
these	1
sentiments,"	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying,	1
"so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you!"	1
	1
Behind	1
him	1
stood	1
the	1
aide-de-camp,	1
the	1
doctors,	1
and	1
the	1
menservants;	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
had	1
separated	1
as	1
in	1
church.	1
All	1
were	1
silently	1
crossing	1
themselves,	1
and	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
service,	1
the	1
subdued	1
chanting	1
of	1
deep	1
bass	1
voices,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
intervals	1
sighs	1
and	1
the	1
shuffling	1
of	1
feet	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
importance	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
quite	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
about,	1
went	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
where	1
Pierre	1
was	1
standing	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
taper.	1
He	1
lit	1
it	1
and,	1
distracted	1
by	1
observing	1
those	1
around	1
him,	1
began	1
crossing	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
held	1
the	1
taper.	1
	1
Sophie,	1
the	1
rosy,	1
laughter-loving,	1
youngest	1
princess	1
with	1
the	1
mole,	1
watched	1
him.	1
She	1
smiled,	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
remained	1
with	1
it	1
hidden	1
for	1
awhile;	1
then	1
looking	1
up	1
and	1
seeing	1
Pierre	1
she	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
She	1
evidently	1
felt	1
unable	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
laughing,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
looking	1
at	1
him:	1
so	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
temptation	1
she	1
slipped	1
quietly	1
behind	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
columns.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
suddenly	1
ceased,	1
they	1
whispered	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
the	1
count's	1
hand	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
ladies.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
stepped	1
forward	1
and,	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Lorrain	1
from	1
behind	1
her	1
back.	1
The	1
French	1
doctor	1
held	1
no	1
taper;	1
he	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
columns	1
in	1
a	1
respectful	1
attitude	1
implying	1
that	1
he,	1
a	1
foreigner,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
differences	1
of	1
faith,	1
understood	1
the	1
full	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
rite	1
now	1
being	1
performed	1
and	1
even	1
approved	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
now	1
approached	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
noiseless	1
step	1
of	1
one	1
in	1
full	1
vigor	1
of	1
life,	1
with	1
his	1
delicate	1
white	1
fingers	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
green	1
quilt	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
was	1
free,	1
and	1
turning	1
sideways	1
felt	1
the	1
pulse	1
and	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment.	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
given	1
something	1
to	1
drink,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
around	1
him,	1
then	1
the	1
people	1
resumed	1
their	1
places	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
continued.	1
During	1
this	1
interval	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
left	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
leaning,	1
and--with	1
an	1
air	1
which	1
intimated	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
and	1
if	1
others	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
them--did	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
but	1
passed	1
by	1
him,	1
joined	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
and	1
moved	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
stood	1
the	1
high	1
bedstead	1
with	1
its	1
silken	1
hangings.	1
On	1
leaving	1
the	1
bed	1
both	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
passed	1
out	1
by	1
a	1
back	1
door,	1
but	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
places	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
before	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
concluded.	1
Pierre	1
paid	1
no	1
more	1
attention	1
to	1
this	1
occurrence	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on,	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
happening	1
around	1
him	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
essential.	1
	1
The	1
chanting	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
ceased,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
heard	1
respectfully	1
congratulating	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
on	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
sacrament.	1
The	1
dying	1
man	1
lay	1
as	1
lifeless	1
and	1
immovable	1
as	1
before.	1
Around	1
him	1
everyone	1
began	1
to	1
stir:	1
steps	1
were	1
audible	1
and	1
whispers,	1
among	1
which	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
distinct.	1
	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
her	1
say:	1
	1
"Certainly	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
moved	1
onto	1
the	1
bed;	1
here	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible..."	1
	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
so	1
surrounded	1
by	1
doctors,	1
princesses,	1
and	1
servants	1
that	1
Pierre	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
see	1
the	1
reddish-yellow	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
gray	1
mane--	1
which,	1
though	1
he	1
saw	1
other	1
faces	1
as	1
well,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
moment	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
service.	1
He	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
cautious	1
movements	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
crowded	1
round	1
the	1
invalid	1
chair	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
lifted	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
and	1
were	1
moving	1
him.	1
	1
"Catch	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
or	1
you'll	1
drop	1
him!"	1
he	1
heard	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
whisper.	1
"Catch	1
hold	1
from	1
underneath.	1
Here!"	1
exclaimed	1
different	1
voices;	1
and	1
the	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
of	1
the	1
bearers	1
and	1
the	1
shuffling	1
of	1
their	1
feet	1
grew	1
more	1
hurried,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
weight	1
they	1
were	1
carrying	1
were	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
As	1
the	1
bearers,	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
passed	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
momentary	1
glimpse	1
between	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
man's	1
high,	1
stout,	1
uncovered	1
chest	1
and	1
powerful	1
shoulders,	1
raised	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
holding	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
armpits,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
gray,	1
curly,	1
leonine	1
head.	1
This	1
head,	1
with	1
its	1
remarkably	1
broad	1
brow	1
and	1
cheekbones,	1
its	1
handsome,	1
sensual	1
mouth,	1
and	1
its	1
cold,	1
majestic	1
expression,	1
was	1
not	1
disfigured	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
death.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
it	1
three	1
months	1
before,	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
But	1
now	1
this	1
head	1
was	1
swaying	1
helplessly	1
with	1
the	1
uneven	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
bearers,	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
listless	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
itself	1
upon	1
nothing.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
bustle	1
beside	1
the	1
high	1
bedstead,	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
dispersed.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
touched	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
and	1
said,	1
"Come."	1
Pierre	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
laid	1
in	1
a	1
stately	1
pose	1
in	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
ceremony	1
just	1
completed.	1
He	1
lay	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
propped	1
high	1
on	1
the	1
pillows.	1
His	1
hands	1
were	1
symmetrically	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
green	1
silk	1
quilt,	1
the	1
palms	1
downward.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
gazing	1
straight	1
at	1
him,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
understood	1
by	1
mortal	1
man.	1
Either	1
this	1
look	1
meant	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
one	1
has	1
eyes	1
they	1
must	1
look	1
somewhere,	1
or	1
it	1
meant	1
too	1
much.	1
Pierre	1
hesitated,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
guide.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
made	1
a	1
hurried	1
sign	1
with	1
her	1
eyes,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
man's	1
hand	1
and	1
moving	1
her	1
lips	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
send	1
it	1
a	1
kiss.	1
Pierre,	1
carefully	1
stretching	1
his	1
neck	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
quilt,	1
followed	1
her	1
suggestion	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
boned,	1
fleshy	1
hand.	1
Neither	1
the	1
hand	1
nor	1
a	1
single	1
muscle	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
face	1
stirred.	1
Once	1
more	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
next.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
indicated	1
a	1
chair	1
that	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
bed.	1
Pierre	1
obediently	1
sat	1
down,	1
his	1
eyes	1
asking	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
doing	1
right.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
nodded	1
approvingly.	1
Again	1
Pierre	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
naively	1
symmetrical	1
pose	1
of	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
statue,	1
evidently	1
distressed	1
that	1
his	1
stout	1
and	1
clumsy	1
body	1
took	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
room	1
and	1
doing	1
his	1
utmost	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
possible.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
still	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
he	1
sat	1
down.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
indicated	1
by	1
her	1
attitude	1
her	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
pathetic	1
importance	1
of	1
these	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
son.	1
This	1
lasted	1
about	1
two	1
minutes,	1
which	1
to	1
Pierre	1
seemed	1
an	1
hour.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
broad	1
muscles	1
and	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
twitch.	1
The	1
twitching	1
increased,	1
the	1
handsome	1
mouth	1
was	1
drawn	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
(only	1
now	1
did	1
Pierre	1
realize	1
how	1
near	1
death	1
his	1
father	1
was),	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
distorted	1
mouth	1
issued	1
an	1
indistinct,	1
hoarse	1
sound.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
looked	1
attentively	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
man's	1
eyes,	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
wanted;	1
she	1
pointed	1
first	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
then	1
to	1
some	1
drink,	1
then	1
named	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
an	1
inquiring	1
whisper,	1
then	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
quilt.	1
The	1
eyes	1
and	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
showed	1
impatience.	1
He	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
stood	1
constantly	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
"Wants	1
to	1
turn	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
servant,	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
count's	1
heavy	1
body	1
toward	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
to	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
being	1
turned	1
over,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
arms	1
fell	1
back	1
helplessly	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
fruitless	1
effort	1
to	1
pull	1
it	1
forward.	1
Whether	1
he	1
noticed	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
terror	1
with	1
which	1
Pierre	1
regarded	1
that	1
lifeless	1
arm,	1
or	1
whether	1
some	1
other	1
thought	1
flitted	1
across	1
his	1
dying	1
brain,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
refractory	1
arm,	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
terror-stricken	1
face,	1
and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
arm,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
a	1
feeble,	1
piteous	1
smile	1
appeared,	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
features,	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
deride	1
his	1
own	1
helplessness.	1
At	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
smile	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
an	1
unexpected	1
quivering	1
in	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
tickling	1
in	1
his	1
nose,	1
and	1
tears	1
dimmed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
turned	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
side	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall.	1
He	1
sighed.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
dozing,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
observing	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
princesses	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
turn	1
at	1
watching.	1
"Let	1
us	1
go."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXIV	1
	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
except	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
who	1
were	1
sitting	1
under	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
Catherine	1
the	1
Great	1
and	1
talking	1
eagerly.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
they	1
became	1
silent,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
princess	1
hide	1
something	1
as	1
she	1
whispered:	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
bear	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
woman."	1
	1
"Catiche	1
has	1
had	1
tea	1
served	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
drawing	1
room,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Go	1
and	1
take	1
something,	1
my	1
poor	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
hold	1
out."	1
	1
To	1
Pierre	1
he	1
said	1
nothing,	1
merely	1
giving	1
his	1
arm	1
a	1
sympathetic	1
squeeze	1
below	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
with	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
into	1
the	1
small	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
refreshing	1
after	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night	1
as	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
this	1
delicious	1
Russian	1
tea,"	1
Lorrain	1
was	1
saying	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
restrained	1
animation	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
sipping	1
tea	1
from	1
a	1
delicate	1
Chinese	1
handleless	1
cup	1
before	1
a	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
tea	1
and	1
a	1
cold	1
supper	1
were	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
circular	1
room.	1
Around	1
the	1
table	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
house	1
that	1
night	1
had	1
gathered	1
to	1
fortify	1
themselves.	1
Pierre	1
well	1
remembered	1
this	1
small	1
circular	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
its	1
mirrors	1
and	1
little	1
tables.	1
During	1
balls	1
given	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
dance,	1
had	1
liked	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
ladies	1
who,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
in	1
their	1
ball	1
dresses	1
with	1
diamonds	1
and	1
pearls	1
on	1
their	1
bare	1
shoulders,	1
looked	1
at	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
brilliantly	1
lighted	1
mirrors	1
which	1
repeated	1
their	1
reflections	1
several	1
times.	1
Now	1
this	1
same	1
room	1
was	1
dimly	1
lighted	1
by	1
two	1
candles.	1
On	1
one	1
small	1
table	1
tea	1
things	1
and	1
supper	1
dishes	1
stood	1
in	1
disorder,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
a	1
motley	1
throng	1
of	1
people	1
sat	1
there,	1
not	1
merrymaking,	1
but	1
somberly	1
whispering,	1
and	1
betraying	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
movement	1
that	1
they	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
forgot	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
happen	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
eat	1
anything	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
very	1
much	1
have	1
liked	1
to.	1
He	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
monitress	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
again	1
going	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess.	1
Pierre	1
concluded	1
that	1
this	1
also	1
was	1
essential,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
interval	1
followed	1
her.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
the	1
princess,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
speaking	1
in	1
excited	1
whispers.	1
	1
"Permit	1
me,	1
Princess,	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
necessary	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
not	1
necessary,"	1
said	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
speakers,	1
evidently	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
room.	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
princess,"	1
answered	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
blandly	1
but	1
impressively,	1
blocking	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
and	1
preventing	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
passing,	1
"won't	1
this	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
poor	1
Uncle	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
needs	1
repose?	1
Worldly	1
conversation	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
already	1
prepared..."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
in	1
his	1
familiar	1
attitude,	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
crossed	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
other.	1
His	1
cheeks,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
flabby	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
heavier	1
below,	1
were	1
twitching	1
violently;	1
but	1
he	1
wore	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
little	1
concerned	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
saying.	1
	1
"Come,	1
my	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
let	1
Catiche	1
do	1
as	1
she	1
pleases.	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
fond	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
of	1
her."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
paper,"	1
said	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ladies,	1
addressing	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
an	1
inlaid	1
portfolio	1
she	1
held	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
"All	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
his	1
real	1
will	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
writing	1
table,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
paper	1
he	1
has	1
forgotten...."	1
	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
pass	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
sprang	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bar	1
her	1
path.	1
	1
"I	1
know,	1
my	1
dear,	1
kind	1
princess,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
seizing	1
the	1
portfolio	1
so	1
firmly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
easily.	1
"Dear	1
princess,	1
I	1
beg	1
and	1
implore	1
you,	1
have	1
some	1
pity	1
on	1
him!	1
Je	1
vous	1
en	1
conjure..."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
Their	1
efforts	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
the	1
portfolio	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
audible,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
speak,	1
her	1
words	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
flattering	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
Though	1
the	1
latter	1
held	1
on	1
tenaciously,	1
her	1
voice	1
lost	1
none	1
of	1
its	1
honeyed	1
firmness	1
and	1
softness.	1
	1
"Pierre,	1
my	1
dear,	1
come	1
here.	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
a	1
family	1
consultation;	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
Prince?"	1
	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak,	1
cousin?"	1
suddenly	1
shrieked	1
the	1
princess	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
heard	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
startled.	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
remain	1
silent	1
when	1
heaven	1
knows	1
who	1
permits	1
herself	1
to	1
interfere,	1
making	1
a	1
scene	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
threshold	1
of	1
a	1
dying	1
man's	1
room?	1
Intriguer!"	1
she	1
hissed	1
viciously,	1
and	1
tugged	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might	1
at	1
the	1
portfolio.	1
	1
But	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
went	1
forward	1
a	1
step	1
or	1
two	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
portfolio,	1
and	1
changed	1
her	1
grip.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
rose.	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
reproach	1
and	1
surprise,	1
"this	1
is	1
absurd!	1
Come,	1
let	1
go	1
I	1
tell	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
let	1
go.	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
too!"	1
	1
But	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
did	1
not	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
"Let	1
go,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
responsibility.	1
I	1
myself	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
him,	1
I!...	1
does	1
that	1
satisfy	1
you?"	1
	1
"But,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
"after	1
such	1
a	1
solemn	1
sacrament,	1
allow	1
him	1
a	1
moment's	1
peace!	1
Here,	1
Pierre,	1
tell	1
them	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
said	1
she,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who,	1
having	1
come	1
quite	1
close,	1
was	1
gazing	1
with	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
angry	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
which	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
dignity,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
twitching	1
cheeks	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"Remember	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
consequences,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
severely.	1
"You	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing."	1
	1
"Vile	1
woman!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
princess,	1
darting	1
unexpectedly	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
portfolio	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
that	1
terrible	1
door,	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
watched	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
opened	1
so	1
quietly,	1
burst	1
noisily	1
open	1
and	1
banged	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
sisters	1
rushed	1
out	1
wringing	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing!"	1
she	1
cried	1
vehemently.	1
"He	1
is	1
dying	1
and	1
you	1
leave	1
me	1
alone	1
with	1
him!"	1
	1
Her	1
sister	1
dropped	1
the	1
portfolio.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
stooping,	1
quickly	1
caught	1
up	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
contention	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
The	1
eldest	1
princess	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
recovering	1
themselves,	1
followed	1
her.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
eldest	1
sister	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
hard	1
face,	1
again	1
biting	1
her	1
underlip.	1
At	1
sight	1
of	1
Pierre	1
her	1
expression	1
showed	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
hatred.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
now	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
glad!"	1
said	1
she;	1
"this	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
waiting	1
for."	1
And	1
bursting	1
into	1
tears	1
she	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
came	1
next.	1
He	1
staggered	1
to	1
the	1
sofa	1
on	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
and	1
dropped	1
onto	1
it,	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
jaw	1
quivered	1
and	1
shook	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
an	1
ague.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
friend!"	1
said	1
he,	1
taking	1
Pierre	1
by	1
the	1
elbow;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
a	1
sincerity	1
and	1
weakness	1
Pierre	1
had	1
never	1
observed	1
in	1
it	1
before.	1
"How	1
often	1
we	1
sin,	1
how	1
much	1
we	1
deceive,	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
what?	1
I	1
am	1
near	1
sixty,	1
dear	1
friend...	1
I	1
too...	1
All	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
death,	1
all!	1
Death	1
is	1
awful..."	1
and	1
he	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
came	1
out	1
last.	1
She	1
approached	1
Pierre	1
with	1
slow,	1
quiet	1
steps.	1
	1
"Pierre!"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
inquiring	1
look.	1
She	1
kissed	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
on	1
his	1
forehead,	1
wetting	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
tears.	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
no	1
more...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"Come,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you.	1
Try	1
to	1
weep,	1
nothing	1
gives	1
such	1
relief	1
as	1
tears."	1
	1
She	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
Pierre	1
was	1
glad	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
face.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
returned	1
he	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre:	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
dear,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
for	1
us	1
all,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
you.	1
But	1
God	1
will	1
support	1
you:	1
you	1
are	1
young,	1
and	1
are	1
now,	1
I	1
hope,	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
fortune.	1
The	1
will	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
opened.	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
your	1
head,	1
but	1
it	1
imposes	1
duties	1
on	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
man."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
silent.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
later	1
on	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
there,	1
God	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened!	1
You	1
know,	1
Uncle	1
promised	1
me	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
Boris.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time.	1
I	1
hope,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
you	1
will	1
carry	1
out	1
your	1
father's	1
wish?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
understood	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
coloring	1
shyly	1
looked	1
in	1
silence	1
at	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
After	1
her	1
talk	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
On	1
waking	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
she	1
told	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
death.	1
She	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
died	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
wish	1
to	1
die,	1
that	1
his	1
end	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
touching	1
but	1
edifying.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
meeting	1
between	1
father	1
and	1
son,	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
touching	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
tears,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
had	1
behaved	1
better	1
during	1
those	1
awful	1
moments--the	1
father	1
who	1
so	1
remembered	1
everything	1
and	1
everybody	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
such	1
pathetic	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
son,	1
or	1
Pierre,	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pitiful	1
to	1
see,	1
so	1
stricken	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
grief,	1
though	1
he	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
sadden	1
his	1
dying	1
father.	1
"It	1
is	1
painful,	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
one	1
good.	1
It	1
uplifts	1
the	1
soul	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
and	1
his	1
worthy	1
son,"	1
said	1
she.	1
Of	1
the	1
behavior	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
she	1
spoke	1
disapprovingly,	1
but	1
in	1
whispers	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
secret.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXV	1
	1
At	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Andreevich	1
Bolkonski's	1
estate,	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
young	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
daily	1
expected,	1
but	1
this	1
expectation	1
did	1
not	1
upset	1
the	1
regular	1
routine	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
household.	1
General	1
in	1
Chief	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Andreevich	1
(nicknamed	1
in	1
society,	1
"the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia")	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Paul	1
had	1
exiled	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
estate	1
had	1
lived	1
there	1
continuously	1
with	1
his	1
daughter,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
her	1
companion,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
Though	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
reign	1
he	1
was	1
free	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
capitals,	1
he	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
remarking	1
that	1
anyone	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
could	1
come	1
the	1
hundred	1
miles	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
while	1
he	1
himself	1
needed	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
nothing.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
only	1
two	1
sources	1
of	1
human	1
vice--idleness	1
and	1
superstition,	1
and	1
only	1
two	1
virtues--activity	1
and	1
intelligence.	1
He	1
himself	1
undertook	1
his	1
daughter's	1
education,	1
and	1
to	1
develop	1
these	1
two	1
cardinal	1
virtues	1
in	1
her	1
gave	1
her	1
lessons	1
in	1
algebra	1
and	1
geometry	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
twenty,	1
and	1
arranged	1
her	1
life	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
whole	1
time	1
was	1
occupied.	1
He	1
was	1
himself	1
always	1
occupied:	1
writing	1
his	1
memoirs,	1
solving	1
problems	1
in	1
higher	1
mathematics,	1
turning	1
snuffboxes	1
on	1
a	1
lathe,	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
or	1
superintending	1
the	1
building	1
that	1
was	1
always	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
his	1
estate.	1
As	1
regularity	1
is	1
a	1
prime	1
condition	1
facilitating	1
activity,	1
regularity	1
in	1
his	1
household	1
was	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
point	1
of	1
exactitude.	1
He	1
always	1
came	1
to	1
table	1
under	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
conditions,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
minute.	1
With	1
those	1
about	1
him,	1
from	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
his	1
serfs,	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
sharp	1
and	1
invariably	1
exacting,	1
so	1
that	1
without	1
being	1
a	1
hardhearted	1
man	1
he	1
inspired	1
such	1
fear	1
and	1
respect	1
as	1
few	1
hardhearted	1
men	1
would	1
have	1
aroused.	1
Although	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
retirement	1
and	1
had	1
now	1
no	1
influence	1
in	1
political	1
affairs,	1
every	1
high	1
official	1
appointed	1
to	1
the	1
province	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
prince's	1
estate	1
lay	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
and	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
lofty	1
antechamber	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
architect,	1
gardener,	1
or	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did,	1
till	1
the	1
prince	1
appeared	1
punctually	1
to	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour.	1
Everyone	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
antechamber	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
even	1
fear	1
when	1
the	1
enormously	1
high	1
study	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
rather	1
small	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
powdered	1
wig,	1
small	1
withered	1
hands,	1
and	1
bushy	1
gray	1
eyebrows	1
which,	1
when	1
he	1
frowned,	1
sometimes	1
hid	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
his	1
shrewd,	1
youthfully	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
couple	1
were	1
to	1
arrive,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
entered	1
the	1
antechamber	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
for	1
the	1
morning	1
greeting,	1
crossing	1
herself	1
with	1
trepidation	1
and	1
repeating	1
a	1
silent	1
prayer.	1
Every	1
morning	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
like	1
that,	1
and	1
every	1
morning	1
prayed	1
that	1
the	1
daily	1
interview	1
might	1
pass	1
off	1
well.	1
	1
An	1
old	1
powdered	1
manservant	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
antechamber	1
rose	1
quietly	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
"Please	1
walk	1
in."	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
regular	1
hum	1
of	1
a	1
lathe.	1
The	1
princess	1
timidly	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
moved	1
noiselessly	1
and	1
easily.	1
She	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
entrance.	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
working	1
at	1
the	1
lathe	1
and	1
after	1
glancing	1
round	1
continued	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
The	1
enormous	1
study	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
things	1
evidently	1
in	1
constant	1
use.	1
The	1
large	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
plans,	1
the	1
tall	1
glass-fronted	1
bookcases	1
with	1
keys	1
in	1
the	1
locks,	1
the	1
high	1
desk	1
for	1
writing	1
while	1
standing	1
up,	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
an	1
open	1
exercise	1
book,	1
and	1
the	1
lathe	1
with	1
tools	1
laid	1
ready	1
to	1
hand	1
and	1
shavings	1
scattered	1
around--all	1
indicated	1
continuous,	1
varied,	1
and	1
orderly	1
activity.	1
The	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
foot	1
shod	1
in	1
a	1
Tartar	1
boot	1
embroidered	1
with	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
firm	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
lean	1
sinewy	1
hand,	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
still	1
possessed	1
the	1
tenacious	1
endurance	1
and	1
vigor	1
of	1
hardy	1
old	1
age.	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
turns	1
of	1
the	1
lathe	1
he	1
removed	1
his	1
foot	1
from	1
the	1
pedal,	1
wiped	1
his	1
chisel,	1
dropped	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
leather	1
pouch	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
lathe,	1
and,	1
approaching	1
the	1
table,	1
summoned	1
his	1
daughter.	1
He	1
never	1
gave	1
his	1
children	1
a	1
blessing,	1
so	1
he	1
simply	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
bristly	1
cheek	1
(as	1
yet	1
unshaven)	1
and,	1
regarding	1
her	1
tenderly	1
and	1
attentively,	1
said	1
severely:	1
	1
"Quite	1
well?	1
All	1
right	1
then,	1
sit	1
down."	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
containing	1
lessons	1
in	1
geometry	1
written	1
by	1
himself	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
foot.	1
	1
"For	1
tomorrow!"	1
said	1
he,	1
quickly	1
finding	1
the	1
page	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
scratch	1
from	1
one	1
paragraph	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
his	1
hard	1
nail.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
here's	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
suddenly,	1
taking	1
a	1
letter	1
addressed	1
in	1
a	1
woman's	1
hand	1
from	1
a	1
bag	1
hanging	1
above	1
the	1
table,	1
onto	1
which	1
he	1
threw	1
it.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
red	1
patches	1
showed	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
princess'	1
face.	1
She	1
took	1
it	1
quickly	1
and	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
over	1
it.	1
	1
"From	1
Heloise?"	1
asked	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
his	1
still	1
sound,	1
yellowish	1
teeth.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
from	1
Julie,"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
and	1
a	1
timid	1
smile.	1
	1
"I'll	1
let	1
two	1
more	1
letters	1
pass,	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
I'll	1
read,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
sternly;	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
you	1
write	1
much	1
nonsense.	1
I'll	1
read	1
the	1
third!"	1
	1
"Read	1
this	1
if	1
you	1
like,	1
Father,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
blushing	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
"The	1
third,	1
I	1
said	1
the	1
third!"	1
cried	1
the	1
prince	1
abruptly,	1
pushing	1
the	1
letter	1
away,	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
drew	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
containing	1
geometrical	1
figures.	1
	1
"Well,	1
madam,"	1
he	1
began,	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
book	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
placing	1
an	1
arm	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
sat,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
surrounded	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
by	1
the	1
acrid	1
scent	1
of	1
old	1
age	1
and	1
tobacco,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
so	1
long.	1
"Now,	1
madam,	1
these	1
triangles	1
are	1
equal;	1
please	1
note	1
that	1
the	1
angle	1
ABC..."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
way	1
at	1
her	1
father's	1
eyes	1
glittering	1
close	1
to	1
her;	1
the	1
red	1
patches	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
came	1
and	1
went,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
nothing	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
her	1
fear	1
would	1
prevent	1
her	1
understanding	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
further	1
explanations,	1
however	1
clear	1
they	1
might	1
be.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
teacher's	1
fault	1
or	1
the	1
pupil's,	1
this	1
same	1
thing	1
happened	1
every	1
day:	1
the	1
princess'	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
anything,	1
but	1
was	1
only	1
conscious	1
of	1
her	1
stern	1
father's	1
withered	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her,	1
of	1
his	1
breath	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
could	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
quickly	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
problem	1
in	1
peace.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
beside	1
himself:	1
moved	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
noisily	1
backward	1
and	1
forward,	1
made	1
efforts	1
to	1
control	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
become	1
vehement,	1
but	1
almost	1
always	1
did	1
become	1
vehement,	1
scolded,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
flung	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
gave	1
a	1
wrong	1
answer.	1
	1
"Well	1
now,	1
isn't	1
she	1
a	1
fool!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince,	1
pushing	1
the	1
book	1
aside	1
and	1
turning	1
sharply	1
away;	1
but	1
rising	1
immediately,	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
lightly	1
touched	1
his	1
daughter's	1
hair	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again.	1
	1
He	1
drew	1
up	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
explain.	1
	1
"This	1
won't	1
do,	1
Princess;	1
it	1
won't	1
do,"	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
having	1
taken	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
day's	1
lesson,	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
leave:	1
"Mathematics	1
are	1
most	1
important,	1
madam!	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
like	1
our	1
silly	1
ladies.	1
Get	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
you'll	1
like	1
it,"	1
and	1
he	1
patted	1
her	1
cheek.	1
"It	1
will	1
drive	1
all	1
the	1
nonsense	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
head."	1
	1
She	1
turned	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
uncut	1
book	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
desk.	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
Key	1
to	1
the	1
Mysteries	1
that	1
your	1
Heloise	1
has	1
sent	1
you.	1
Religious!	1
I	1
don't	1
interfere	1
with	1
anyone's	1
belief...	1
I	1
have	1
looked	1
at	1
it.	1
Take	1
it.	1
Well,	1
now	1
go.	1
Go."	1
	1
He	1
patted	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
himself	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
her.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
sad,	1
scared	1
expression	1
that	1
rarely	1
left	1
her	1
and	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
plain,	1
sickly	1
face	1
yet	1
plainer.	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
writing	1
table,	1
on	1
which	1
stood	1
miniature	1
portraits	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
littered	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
papers.	1
The	1
princess	1
was	1
as	1
untidy	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
tidy.	1
She	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
geometry	1
book	1
and	1
eagerly	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
her	1
letter.	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
her	1
most	1
intimate	1
friend	1
from	1
childhood;	1
that	1
same	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
name-	1
day	1
party.	1
	1
Julie	1
wrote	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
Dear	1
and	1
precious	1
Friend,	1
How	1
terrible	1
and	1
frightful	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
separation!	1
Though	1
I	1
tell	1
myself	1
that	1
half	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
half	1
my	1
happiness	1
are	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
distance	1
separating	1
us	1
our	1
hearts	1
are	1
united	1
by	1
indissoluble	1
bonds,	1
my	1
heart	1
rebels	1
against	1
fate	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
and	1
distractions	1
around	1
me	1
I	1
cannot	1
overcome	1
a	1
certain	1
secret	1
sorrow	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
ever	1
since	1
we	1
parted.	1
Why	1
are	1
we	1
not	1
together	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
last	1
summer,	1
in	1
your	1
big	1
study,	1
on	1
the	1
blue	1
sofa,	1
the	1
confidential	1
sofa?	1
Why	1
cannot	1
I	1
now,	1
as	1
three	1
months	1
ago,	1
draw	1
fresh	1
moral	1
strength	1
from	1
your	1
look,	1
so	1
gentle,	1
calm,	1
and	1
penetrating,	1
a	1
look	1
I	1
loved	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
write?	1
	1
Having	1
read	1
thus	1
far,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sighed	1
and	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
mirror	1
which	1
stood	1
on	1
her	1
right.	1
It	1
reflected	1
a	1
weak,	1
ungraceful	1
figure	1
and	1
thin	1
face.	1
Her	1
eyes,	1
always	1
sad,	1
now	1
looked	1
with	1
particular	1
hopelessness	1
at	1
her	1
reflection	1
in	1
the	1
glass.	1
"She	1
flatters	1
me,"	1
thought	1
the	1
princess,	1
turning	1
away	1
and	1
continuing	1
to	1
read.	1
But	1
Julie	1
did	1
not	1
flatter	1
her	1
friend,	1
the	1
princess'	1
eyes--large,	1
deep	1
and	1
luminous	1
(it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
times	1
there	1
radiated	1
from	1
them	1
shafts	1
of	1
warm	1
light)--were	1
so	1
beautiful	1
that	1
very	1
often	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
plainness	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
they	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
attraction	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
beauty.	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
never	1
saw	1
the	1
beautiful	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
eyes--the	1
look	1
they	1
had	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
herself.	1
As	1
with	1
everyone,	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
forced	1
unnatural	1
expression	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
glass.	1
She	1
went	1
on	1
reading:	1
	1
All	1
Moscow	1
talks	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
war.	1
One	1
of	1
my	1
two	1
brothers	1
is	1
already	1
abroad,	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Guards,	1
who	1
are	1
starting	1
on	1
their	1
march	1
to	1
the	1
frontier.	1
Our	1
dear	1
Emperor	1
has	1
left	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
thought	1
intends	1
to	1
expose	1
his	1
precious	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
chances	1
of	1
war.	1
God	1
grant	1
that	1
the	1
Corsican	1
monster	1
who	1
is	1
destroying	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
Europe	1
may	1
be	1
overthrown	1
by	1
the	1
angel	1
whom	1
it	1
has	1
pleased	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
in	1
His	1
goodness,	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
as	1
sovereign!	1
To	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
my	1
brothers,	1
this	1
war	1
has	1
deprived	1
me	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
associations	1
nearest	1
my	1
heart.	1
I	1
mean	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
enthusiasm	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
remain	1
inactive	1
and	1
has	1
left	1
the	1
university	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army.	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
to	1
you,	1
dear	1
Mary,	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
extreme	1
youth	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
grief	1
to	1
me.	1
This	1
young	1
man,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
you	1
last	1
summer,	1
is	1
so	1
noble-minded	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
that	1
real	1
youthfulness	1
which	1
one	1
seldom	1
finds	1
nowadays	1
among	1
our	1
old	1
men	1
of	1
twenty	1
and,	1
particularly,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
frank	1
and	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
heart.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
pure	1
and	1
poetic	1
that	1
my	1
relations	1
with	1
him,	1
transient	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sweetest	1
comforts	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
heart,	1
which	1
has	1
already	1
suffered	1
so	1
much.	1
Someday	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
our	1
parting	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
then.	1
That	1
is	1
still	1
too	1
fresh.	1
Ah,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
you	1
are	1
happy	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
these	1
poignant	1
joys	1
and	1
sorrows.	1
You	1
are	1
fortunate,	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
are	1
generally	1
the	1
stronger!	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
Count	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
too	1
young	1
ever	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
a	1
friend,	1
but	1
this	1
sweet	1
friendship,	1
this	1
poetic	1
and	1
pure	1
intimacy,	1
were	1
what	1
my	1
heart	1
needed.	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
this!	1
The	1
chief	1
news,	1
about	1
which	1
all	1
Moscow	1
gossips,	1
is	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
old	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
Fancy!	1
The	1
three	1
princesses	1
have	1
received	1
very	1
little,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
nothing,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre	1
who	1
has	1
inherited	1
all	1
the	1
property	1
and	1
has	1
besides	1
been	1
recognized	1
as	1
legitimate;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
and	1
possessor	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
fortune	1
in	1
Russia.	1
It	1
is	1
rumored	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
played	1
a	1
very	1
despicable	1
part	1
in	1
this	1
affair	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
quite	1
crestfallen.	1
	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
understand	1
very	1
little	1
about	1
all	1
these	1
matters	1
of	1
wills	1
and	1
inheritance;	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
whom	1
we	1
all	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
as	1
plain	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
has	1
become	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
fortunes	1
in	1
Russia,	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
amused	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
and	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
mammas	1
burdened	1
by	1
marriageable	1
daughters,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
themselves,	1
toward	1
him,	1
though,	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
me,	1
he	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
poor	1
sort	1
of	1
fellow.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
past	1
two	1
years	1
people	1
have	1
amused	1
themselves	1
by	1
finding	1
husbands	1
for	1
me	1
(most	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
don't	1
even	1
know),	1
the	1
matchmaking	1
chronicles	1
of	1
Moscow	1
now	1
speak	1
of	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
future	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova.	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
desire	1
for	1
the	1
post.	1
A	1
propos	1
of	1
marriages:	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
while	1
ago	1
that	1
universal	1
auntie	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
told	1
me,	1
under	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
strict	1
secrecy,	1
of	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
marriage	1
for	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
than	1
with	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son	1
Anatole,	1
whom	1
they	1
wish	1
to	1
reform	1
by	1
marrying	1
him	1
to	1
someone	1
rich	1
and	1
distinguee,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
you	1
that	1
his	1
relations'	1
choice	1
has	1
fallen.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
handsome	1
and	1
a	1
terrible	1
scapegrace.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
gossip.	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
second	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper,	1
and	1
Mamma	1
has	1
sent	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
dine	1
at	1
the	1
Apraksins'.	1
Read	1
the	1
mystical	1
book	1
I	1
am	1
sending	1
you;	1
it	1
has	1
an	1
enormous	1
success	1
here.	1
Though	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
in	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
the	1
feeble	1
human	1
mind	1
to	1
grasp,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
admirable	1
book	1
which	1
calms	1
and	1
elevates	1
the	1
soul.	1
Adieu!	1
Give	1
my	1
respects	1
to	1
monsieur	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
compliments	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
I	1
embrace	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
love	1
you.	1
	1
JULIE	1
	1
P.S.	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
news	1
of	1
your	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
charming	1
little	1
wife.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
pondered	1
awhile	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
entirely	1
transformed.	1
Then	1
she	1
suddenly	1
rose	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
heavy	1
tread	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1
She	1
took	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
and	1
her	1
hand	1
moved	1
rapidly	1
over	1
it.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
reply	1
she	1
wrote,	1
also	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
Dear	1
and	1
precious	1
Friend,	1
Your	1
letter	1
of	1
the	1
13th	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
great	1
delight.	1
So	1
you	1
still	1
love	1
me,	1
my	1
romantic	1
Julie?	1
Separation,	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
say	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
is	1
bad,	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
its	1
usual	1
effect	1
on	1
you.	1
You	1
complain	1
of	1
our	1
separation.	1
What	1
then	1
should	1
I	1
say,	1
if	1
I	1
dared	1
complain,	1
I	1
who	1
am	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
are	1
dear	1
to	1
me?	1
Ah,	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
religion	1
to	1
console	1
us	1
life	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
sad.	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
look	1
severely	1
on	1
your	1
affection	1
for	1
that	1
young	1
man?	1
On	1
such	1
matters	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
severe	1
with	1
myself.	1
I	1
understand	1
such	1
feelings	1
in	1
others,	1
and	1
if	1
never	1
having	1
felt	1
them	1
I	1
cannot	1
approve	1
of	1
them,	1
neither	1
do	1
I	1
condemn	1
them.	1
Only	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
Christian	1
love,	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
neighbor,	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
enemy,	1
is	1
worthier,	1
sweeter,	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
the	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
can	1
inspire	1
in	1
a	1
romantic	1
and	1
loving	1
young	1
girl	1
like	1
yourself.	1
	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
death	1
reached	1
us	1
before	1
your	1
letter	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
much	1
affected	1
by	1
it.	1
He	1
says	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
representative	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
century,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
own	1
turn	1
now,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
he	1
can	1
to	1
let	1
his	1
turn	1
come	1
as	1
late	1
as	1
possible.	1
God	1
preserve	1
us	1
from	1
that	1
terrible	1
misfortune!	1
	1
I	1
cannot	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
about	1
Pierre,	1
whom	1
I	1
knew	1
as	1
a	1
child.	1
He	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
excellent	1
heart,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
quality	1
I	1
value	1
most	1
in	1
people.	1
As	1
to	1
his	1
inheritance	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
played	1
by	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
sad	1
for	1
both.	1
Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
our	1
divine	1
Saviour's	1
words,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
Kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
are	1
terribly	1
true.	1
I	1
pity	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
but	1
am	1
still	1
more	1
sorry	1
for	1
Pierre.	1
So	1
young,	1
and	1
burdened	1
with	1
such	1
riches--to	1
what	1
temptations	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
exposed!	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
asked	1
what	1
I	1
desire	1
most	1
on	1
earth,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
poorer	1
than	1
the	1
poorest	1
beggar.	1
A	1
thousand	1
thanks,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
for	1
the	1
volume	1
you	1
have	1
sent	1
me	1
and	1
which	1
has	1
such	1
success	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Yet	1
since	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
among	1
some	1
good	1
things	1
it	1
contains	1
others	1
which	1
our	1
weak	1
human	1
understanding	1
cannot	1
grasp,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
rather	1
useless	1
to	1
spend	1
time	1
in	1
reading	1
what	1
is	1
unintelligible	1
and	1
can	1
therefore	1
bear	1
no	1
fruit.	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
the	1
fondness	1
some	1
people	1
have	1
for	1
confusing	1
their	1
minds	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
mystical	1
books	1
that	1
merely	1
awaken	1
their	1
doubts	1
and	1
excite	1
their	1
imagination,	1
giving	1
them	1
a	1
bent	1
for	1
exaggeration	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
Christian	1
simplicity.	1
Let	1
us	1
rather	1
read	1
the	1
Epistles	1
and	1
Gospels.	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
seek	1
to	1
penetrate	1
what	1
mysteries	1
they	1
contain;	1
for	1
how	1
can	1
we,	1
miserable	1
sinners	1
that	1
we	1
are,	1
know	1
the	1
terrible	1
and	1
holy	1
secrets	1
of	1
Providence	1
while	1
we	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
flesh	1
which	1
forms	1
an	1
impenetrable	1
veil	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
the	1
Eternal?	1
Let	1
us	1
rather	1
confine	1
ourselves	1
to	1
studying	1
those	1
sublime	1
rules	1
which	1
our	1
divine	1
Saviour	1
has	1
left	1
for	1
our	1
guidance	1
here	1
below.	1
Let	1
us	1
try	1
to	1
conform	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
follow	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
less	1
we	1
let	1
our	1
feeble	1
human	1
minds	1
roam,	1
the	1
better	1
we	1
shall	1
please	1
God,	1
who	1
rejects	1
all	1
knowledge	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
Him;	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
we	1
seek	1
to	1
fathom	1
what	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
conceal	1
from	1
us,	1
the	1
sooner	1
will	1
He	1
vouchsafe	1
its	1
revelation	1
to	1
us	1
through	1
His	1
divine	1
Spirit.	1
	1
My	1
father	1
has	1
not	1
spoken	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
suitor,	1
but	1
has	1
only	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
and	1
is	1
expecting	1
a	1
visit	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
project	1
of	1
marriage	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,	1
dear	1
sweet	1
friend,	1
that	1
I	1
look	1
on	1
marriage	1
as	1
a	1
divine	1
institution	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
must	1
conform.	1
However	1
painful	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
me,	1
should	1
the	1
Almighty	1
lay	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
wife	1
and	1
mother	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
perform	1
them	1
as	1
faithfully	1
as	1
I	1
can,	1
without	1
disquieting	1
myself	1
by	1
examining	1
my	1
feelings	1
toward	1
him	1
whom	1
He	1
may	1
give	1
me	1
for	1
husband.	1
	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
my	1
brother,	1
who	1
announces	1
his	1
speedy	1
arrival	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
with	1
his	1
wife.	1
This	1
pleasure	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
brief	1
one,	1
however,	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
us	1
again	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
this	1
unhappy	1
war	1
into	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
drawn,	1
God	1
knows	1
how	1
or	1
why.	1
Not	1
only	1
where	1
you	1
are--at	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
affairs	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
world--is	1
the	1
talk	1
all	1
of	1
war,	1
even	1
here	1
amid	1
fieldwork	1
and	1
the	1
calm	1
of	1
nature--which	1
townsfolk	1
consider	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
country--rumors	1
of	1
war	1
are	1
heard	1
and	1
painfully	1
felt.	1
My	1
father	1
talks	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
marches	1
and	1
countermarches,	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
understand	1
nothing;	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
during	1
my	1
daily	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
I	1
witnessed	1
a	1
heartrending	1
scene....	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
conscripts	1
enrolled	1
from	1
our	1
people	1
and	1
starting	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army.	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
mothers,	1
wives,	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
going	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
sobs.	1
It	1
seems	1
as	1
though	1
mankind	1
has	1
forgotten	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
its	1
divine	1
Saviour,	1
Who	1
preached	1
love	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
injuries--	1
and	1
that	1
men	1
attribute	1
the	1
greatest	1
merit	1
to	1
skill	1
in	1
killing	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Adieu,	1
dear	1
and	1
kind	1
friend;	1
may	1
our	1
divine	1
Saviour	1
and	1
His	1
most	1
Holy	1
Mother	1
keep	1
you	1
in	1
their	1
holy	1
and	1
all-powerful	1
care!	1
	1
MARY	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you	1
are	1
sending	1
off	1
a	1
letter,	1
Princess?	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
dispatched	1
mine.	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
mother,"	1
said	1
the	1
smiling	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
rapidly,	1
in	1
her	1
pleasant	1
mellow	1
tones	1
and	1
with	1
guttural	1
r's.	1
She	1
brought	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
strenuous,	1
mournful,	1
and	1
gloomy	1
world	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
atmosphere,	1
careless,	1
lighthearted,	1
and	1
self-satisfied.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
I	1
must	1
warn	1
you,"	1
she	1
added,	1
lowering	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
evidently	1
listening	1
to	1
herself	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
speaking	1
with	1
exaggerated	1
grasseyement,	1
"the	1
prince	1
has	1
been	1
scolding	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich.	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
humor,	1
very	1
morose.	1
Be	1
prepared."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
dear	1
friend,"	1
replied	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
"I	1
have	1
asked	1
you	1
never	1
to	1
warn	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
humor	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
in.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
myself	1
to	1
judge	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
others	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
and,	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
five	1
minutes	1
late	1
in	1
starting	1
her	1
practice	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
alarm.	1
Between	1
twelve	1
and	1
two	1
o'clock,	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
mapped	1
out,	1
the	1
prince	1
rested	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
played	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVI	1
	1
The	1
gray-haired	1
valet	1
was	1
sitting	1
drowsily	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
snoring	1
of	1
the	1
prince,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
large	1
study.	1
From	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
through	1
the	1
closed	1
doors	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
difficult	1
passages--twenty	1
times	1
repeated--of	1
a	1
sonata	1
by	1
Dussek.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
a	1
closed	1
carriage	1
and	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
hood	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
helped	1
his	1
little	1
wife	1
to	1
alight,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
before	1
him.	1
Old	1
Tikhon,	1
wearing	1
a	1
wig,	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
antechamber,	1
reported	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
hastily	1
closed	1
the	1
door.	1
Tikhon	1
knew	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
son's	1
arrival	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
unusual	1
event	1
must	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
appointed	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
apparently	1
knew	1
this	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Tikhon;	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
his	1
father's	1
habits	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
last,	1
and,	1
having	1
assured	1
himself	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
"He	1
will	1
get	1
up	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
across	1
to	1
Mary's	1
room,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
grown	1
stouter	1
during	1
this	1
time,	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
short,	1
downy,	1
smiling	1
lip	1
lifted	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
just	1
as	1
merrily	1
and	1
prettily	1
as	1
ever.	1
	1
"Why,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
palace!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
looking	1
around	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
people	1
compliment	1
their	1
host	1
at	1
a	1
ball.	1
"Let's	1
come,	1
quick,	1
quick!"	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
round,	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
Tikhon,	1
at	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
accompanied	1
them.	1
	1
"Is	1
that	1
Mary	1
practicing?	1
Let's	1
go	1
quietly	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
by	1
surprise."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
followed	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
courteous	1
but	1
sad	1
expression.	1
	1
"You've	1
grown	1
older,	1
Tikhon,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
passing	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
who	1
kissed	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
Before	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
clavichord	1
came,	1
the	1
pretty,	1
fair	1
haired	1
Frenchwoman,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
rushed	1
out	1
apparently	1
beside	1
herself	1
with	1
delight.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
what	1
joy	1
for	1
the	1
princess!"	1
exclaimed	1
she:	1
"At	1
last!	1
I	1
must	1
let	1
her	1
know."	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
please	1
not...	1
You	1
are	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
kissing	1
her.	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
already	1
through	1
my	1
sister-in-law's	1
friendship	1
for	1
you.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
expecting	1
us?"	1
	1
They	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
oft-repeated	1
passage	1
of	1
the	1
sonata.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
grimace,	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
something	1
unpleasant.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
passage	1
broke	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
a	1
cry	1
was	1
heard,	1
then	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
heavy	1
tread	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
kissing.	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
princesses,	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
met	1
once	1
before	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
wedding,	1
were	1
in	1
each	1
other's	1
arms	1
warmly	1
pressing	1
their	1
lips	1
to	1
whatever	1
place	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
touch.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
stood	1
near	1
them	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
heart,	1
with	1
a	1
beatific	1
smile	1
and	1
obviously	1
equally	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
or	1
to	1
laugh.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
frowned,	1
as	1
lovers	1
of	1
music	1
do	1
when	1
they	1
hear	1
a	1
false	1
note.	1
The	1
two	1
women	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
late,	1
seized	1
each	1
other's	1
hands,	1
kissing	1
them	1
and	1
pulling	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
kissing	1
each	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
face,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
surprise	1
both	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
kissed	1
again.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
evidently	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
women	1
it	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
cry,	1
and	1
apparently	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
their	1
heads	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
otherwise	1
at	1
this	1
meeting.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
my	1
dear!...	1
Ah!	1
Mary!"	1
they	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
and	1
then	1
laughed.	1
"I	1
dreamed	1
last	1
night..."--"You	1
were	1
not	1
expecting	1
us?..."	1
"Ah!	1
Mary,	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
thinner?..."	1
"And	1
you	1
have	1
grown	1
stouter!..."	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
the	1
princess	1
at	1
once,"	1
put	1
in	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea!..."	1
exclaimed	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Ah,	1
Andrew,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
you."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
his	1
sister,	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
kissed	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
crybaby	1
as	1
ever.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
turned	1
toward	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
through	1
her	1
tears	1
the	1
loving,	1
warm,	1
gentle	1
look	1
of	1
her	1
large	1
luminous	1
eyes,	1
very	1
beautiful	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
rested	1
on	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
talked	1
incessantly,	1
her	1
short,	1
downy	1
upper	1
lip	1
continually	1
and	1
rapidly	1
touching	1
her	1
rosy	1
nether	1
lip	1
when	1
necessary	1
and	1
drawing	1
up	1
again	1
next	1
moment	1
when	1
her	1
face	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
glittering	1
teeth	1
and	1
sparkling	1
eyes.	1
She	1
told	1
of	1
an	1
accident	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
Spasski	1
Hill	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
serious	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
condition,	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
that	1
informed	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
all	1
her	1
clothes	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
heaven	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
dress	1
in	1
here;	1
and	1
that	1
Andrew	1
had	1
quite	1
changed,	1
and	1
that	1
Kitty	1
Odyntsova	1
had	1
married	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
suitor	1
for	1
Mary,	1
a	1
real	1
one,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
later.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
still	1
looking	1
silently	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
sadness.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
following	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
independent	1
of	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
words.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
Petersburg	1
fete	1
she	1
addressed	1
her	1
brother:	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
Andrew?"	1
she	1
said	1
sighing.	1
	1
Lise	1
sighed	1
too.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
even	1
tomorrow,"	1
replied	1
her	1
brother.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
leaving	1
me	1
here,	1
God	1
knows	1
why,	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
promotion..."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
but	1
continuing	1
her	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
sister-in-law	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
figure.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
certain?"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
changed.	1
She	1
sighed	1
and	1
said:	1
"Yes,	1
quite	1
certain.	1
Ah!	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
dreadful..."	1
	1
Her	1
lip	1
descended.	1
She	1
brought	1
her	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"She	1
needs	1
rest,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
"Don't	1
you,	1
Lise?	1
Take	1
her	1
to	1
your	1
room	1
and	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
Father.	1
How	1
is	1
he?	1
Just	1
the	1
same?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
just	1
the	1
same.	1
Though	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
your	1
opinion	1
will	1
be,"	1
answered	1
the	1
princess	1
joyfully.	1
	1
"And	1
are	1
the	1
hours	1
the	1
same?	1
And	1
the	1
walks	1
in	1
the	1
avenues?	1
And	1
the	1
lathe?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
which	1
showed	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
weaknesses.	1
	1
"The	1
hours	1
are	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
the	1
lathe,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
mathematics	1
and	1
my	1
geometry	1
lessons,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
gleefully,	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
lessons	1
in	1
geometry	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
greatest	1
delights	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
had	1
elapsed	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
get	1
up,	1
Tikhon	1
came	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
young	1
prince	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
made	1
a	1
departure	1
from	1
his	1
usual	1
routine	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
his	1
son's	1
arrival:	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
admit	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
apartments	1
while	1
he	1
dressed	1
for	1
dinner.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
always	1
dressed	1
in	1
old-fashioned	1
style,	1
wearing	1
an	1
antique	1
coat	1
and	1
powdered	1
hair;	1
and	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
his	1
father's	1
dressing	1
room	1
(not	1
with	1
the	1
contemptuous	1
look	1
and	1
manner	1
he	1
wore	1
in	1
drawing	1
rooms,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
animated	1
face	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
Pierre),	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
leather-covered	1
chair,	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
powdering	1
mantle,	1
entrusting	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
Tikhon.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
here's	1
the	1
warrior!	1
Wants	1
to	1
vanquish	1
Buonaparte?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
shaking	1
his	1
powdered	1
head	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
tail,	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
holding	1
fast	1
to	1
plait,	1
would	1
allow.	1
	1
"You	1
at	1
least	1
must	1
tackle	1
him	1
properly,	1
or	1
else	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
he'll	1
soon	1
have	1
us,	1
too,	1
for	1
his	1
subjects!	1
How	1
are	1
you?"	1
And	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
cheek.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper	1
after	1
his	1
nap	1
before	1
dinner.	1
(He	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
nap	1
"after	1
dinner	1
was	1
silver--before	1
dinner,	1
golden.")	1
He	1
cast	1
happy,	1
sidelong	1
glances	1
at	1
his	1
son	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
thick,	1
bushy	1
eyebrows.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
father	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
indicated	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
on	1
his	1
father's	1
favorite	1
topic--	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
more	1
particularly	1
of	1
Bonaparte.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Father,	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
brought	1
my	1
wife	1
who	1
is	1
pregnant,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
following	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
face	1
with	1
an	1
eager	1
and	1
respectful	1
look.	1
"How	1
is	1
your	1
health?"	1
	1
"Only	1
fools	1
and	1
rakes	1
fall	1
ill,	1
my	1
boy.	1
You	1
know	1
me:	1
I	1
am	1
busy	1
from	1
morning	1
till	1
night	1
and	1
abstemious,	1
so	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
am	1
well."	1
	1
"Thank	1
God,"	1
said	1
his	1
son	1
smiling.	1
	1
"God	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it!	1
Well,	1
go	1
on,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
hobby;	1
"tell	1
me	1
how	1
the	1
Germans	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
to	1
fight	1
Bonaparte	1
by	1
this	1
new	1
science	1
you	1
call	1
'strategy.'"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
time	1
to	1
collect	1
my	1
wits,	1
Father,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
his	1
father's	1
foibles	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
his	1
son	1
from	1
loving	1
and	1
honoring	1
him.	1
"Why,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
settle	1
down!"	1
	1
"Nonsense,	1
nonsense!"	1
cried	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
shaking	1
his	1
pigtail	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
firmly	1
plaited,	1
and	1
grasping	1
his	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
"The	1
house	1
for	1
your	1
wife	1
is	1
ready.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
will	1
take	1
her	1
there	1
and	1
show	1
her	1
over,	1
and	1
they'll	1
talk	1
nineteen	1
to	1
the	1
dozen.	1
That's	1
their	1
woman's	1
way!	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
her.	1
Sit	1
down	1
and	1
talk.	1
About	1
Mikhelson's	1
army	1
I	1
understand--Tolstoy's	1
too...	1
a	1
simultaneous	1
expedition....	1
But	1
what's	1
the	1
southern	1
army	1
to	1
do?	1
Prussia	1
is	1
neutral...	1
I	1
know	1
that.	1
What	1
about	1
Austria?"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
followed	1
by	1
Tikhon,	1
who	1
ran	1
after	1
him,	1
handing	1
him	1
different	1
articles	1
of	1
clothing.	1
"What	1
of	1
Sweden?	1
How	1
will	1
they	1
cross	1
Pomerania?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
seeing	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
insisted,	1
began--at	1
first	1
reluctantly,	1
but	1
gradually	1
with	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animation,	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
changing	1
unconsciously	1
from	1
Russian	1
to	1
French	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on--to	1
explain	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
operation	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
campaign.	1
He	1
explained	1
how	1
an	1
army,	1
ninety	1
thousand	1
strong,	1
was	1
to	1
threaten	1
Prussia	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
neutrality	1
and	1
draw	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
war;	1
how	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
army	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
some	1
Swedish	1
forces	1
at	1
Stralsund;	1
how	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
Austrians,	1
with	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
Russians,	1
were	1
to	1
operate	1
in	1
Italy	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
Rhine;	1
how	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
Russians	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
English	1
were	1
to	1
land	1
at	1
Naples,	1
and	1
how	1
a	1
total	1
force	1
of	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
was	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
from	1
different	1
sides.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
did	1
not	1
evince	1
the	1
least	1
interest	1
during	1
this	1
explanation,	1
but	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
it	1
continued	1
to	1
dress	1
while	1
walking	1
about,	1
and	1
three	1
times	1
unexpectedly	1
interrupted.	1
Once	1
he	1
stopped	1
it	1
by	1
shouting:	1
"The	1
white	1
one,	1
the	1
white	1
one!"	1
	1
This	1
meant	1
that	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
not	1
handing	1
him	1
the	1
waistcoat	1
he	1
wanted.	1
Another	1
time	1
he	1
interrupted,	1
saying:	1
	1
"And	1
will	1
she	1
soon	1
be	1
confined?"	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
reproachfully	1
said:	1
"That's	1
bad!	1
Go	1
on,	1
go	1
on."	1
	1
The	1
third	1
interruption	1
came	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
finishing	1
his	1
description.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
sing,	1
in	1
the	1
cracked	1
voice	1
of	1
old	1
age:	1
"Malbrook	1
s'en	1
va-t-en	1
guerre.	1
Dieu	1
sait	1
quand	1
reviendra."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Marlborough	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
wars;	1
God	1
knows	1
when	1
he'll	1
return."	1
	1
His	1
son	1
only	1
smiled.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
say	1
it's	1
a	1
plan	1
I	1
approve	1
of,"	1
said	1
the	1
son;	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
telling	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is.	1
Napoleon	1
has	1
also	1
formed	1
his	1
plan	1
by	1
now,	1
not	1
worse	1
than	1
this	1
one."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you've	1
told	1
me	1
nothing	1
new,"	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
repeated,	1
meditatively	1
and	1
rapidly:	1
	1
"Dieu	1
sait	1
quand	1
reviendra.	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
room."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXVII	1
	1
At	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour	1
the	1
prince,	1
powdered	1
and	1
shaven,	1
entered	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
where	1
his	1
daughter-in-law,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
were	1
already	1
awaiting	1
him	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
architect,	1
who	1
by	1
a	1
strange	1
caprice	1
of	1
his	1
employer's	1
was	1
admitted	1
to	1
table	1
though	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
that	1
insignificant	1
individual	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
could	1
certainly	1
not	1
have	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
honor.	1
The	1
prince,	1
who	1
generally	1
kept	1
very	1
strictly	1
to	1
social	1
distinctions	1
and	1
rarely	1
admitted	1
even	1
important	1
government	1
officials	1
to	1
his	1
table,	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
selected	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
(who	1
always	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
to	1
blow	1
his	1
nose	1
on	1
his	1
checked	1
handkerchief)	1
to	1
illustrate	1
the	1
theory	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
are	1
equals,	1
and	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
impressed	1
on	1
his	1
daughter	1
that	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
was	1
"not	1
a	1
whit	1
worse	1
than	1
you	1
or	1
I."	1
At	1
dinner	1
the	1
prince	1
usually	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
taciturn	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
to	1
anyone	1
else.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
dining	1
room,	1
which	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
lofty,	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
and	1
the	1
footmen--one	1
behind	1
each	1
chair--stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
enter.	1
The	1
head	1
butler,	1
napkin	1
on	1
arm,	1
was	1
scanning	1
the	1
setting	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
the	1
footmen,	1
and	1
anxiously	1
glancing	1
from	1
the	1
clock	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
to	1
enter.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
large	1
gilt	1
frame,	1
new	1
to	1
him,	1
containing	1
the	1
genealogical	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
Princes	1
Bolkonski,	1
opposite	1
which	1
hung	1
another	1
such	1
frame	1
with	1
a	1
badly	1
painted	1
portrait	1
(evidently	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
artist	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
estate)	1
of	1
a	1
ruling	1
prince,	1
in	1
a	1
crown--an	1
alleged	1
descendant	1
of	1
Rurik	1
and	1
ancestor	1
of	1
the	1
Bolkonskis.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
looking	1
again	1
at	1
that	1
genealogical	1
tree,	1
shook	1
his	1
head,	1
laughing	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
laughs	1
who	1
looks	1
at	1
a	1
portrait	1
so	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
amusing.	1
	1
"How	1
thoroughly	1
like	1
him	1
that	1
is!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
in	1
surprise.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
laughing	1
at.	1
Everything	1
her	1
father	1
did	1
inspired	1
her	1
with	1
reverence	1
and	1
was	1
beyond	1
question.	1
	1
"Everyone	1
has	1
his	1
Achilles'	1
heel,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Fancy,	1
with	1
his	1
powerful	1
mind,	1
indulging	1
in	1
such	1
nonsense!"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
criticism	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply,	1
when	1
the	1
expected	1
footsteps	1
were	1
heard	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
study.	1
The	1
prince	1
walked	1
in	1
quickly	1
and	1
jauntily	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
wont,	1
as	1
if	1
intentionally	1
contrasting	1
the	1
briskness	1
of	1
his	1
manners	1
with	1
the	1
strict	1
formality	1
of	1
his	1
house.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
great	1
clock	1
struck	1
two	1
and	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
shrill	1
tone	1
joined	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
prince	1
stood	1
still;	1
his	1
lively	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
from	1
under	1
their	1
thick,	1
bushy	1
eyebrows	1
sternly	1
scanned	1
all	1
present	1
and	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
She	1
felt,	1
as	1
courtiers	1
do	1
when	1
the	1
Tsar	1
enters,	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
respect	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
inspired	1
in	1
all	1
around	1
him.	1
He	1
stroked	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
then	1
patted	1
her	1
awkwardly	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
neck.	1
	1
"I'm	1
glad,	1
glad,	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
looking	1
attentively	1
into	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
then	1
quickly	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
"Sit	1
down,	1
sit	1
down!	1
Sit	1
down,	1
Michael	1
Ianovich!"	1
	1
He	1
indicated	1
a	1
place	1
beside	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
daughter-in-law.	1
A	1
footman	1
moved	1
the	1
chair	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"Ho,	1
ho!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
casting	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
her	1
rounded	1
figure.	1
"You've	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
That's	1
bad!"	1
	1
He	1
laughed	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
dry,	1
cold,	1
unpleasant	1
way,	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
only	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
walk,	1
walk	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
did	1
not,	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to,	1
hear	1
his	1
words.	1
She	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
seemed	1
confused.	1
The	1
prince	1
asked	1
her	1
about	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
smile	1
and	1
talk.	1
He	1
asked	1
about	1
mutual	1
acquaintances,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
chattered	1
away	1
giving	1
him	1
greetings	1
from	1
various	1
people	1
and	1
retelling	1
the	1
town	1
gossip.	1
	1
"Countess	1
Apraksina,	1
poor	1
thing,	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
cried	1
her	1
eyes	1
out,"	1
she	1
said,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
lively.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
became	1
animated	1
the	1
prince	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
sternly,	1
and	1
suddenly,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
studied	1
her	1
sufficiently	1
and	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
definite	1
idea	1
of	1
her,	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
addressed	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
our	1
Bonaparte	1
will	1
be	1
having	1
a	1
bad	1
time	1
of	1
it.	1
Prince	1
Andrew"	1
(he	1
always	1
spoke	1
thus	1
of	1
his	1
son)	1
"has	1
been	1
telling	1
me	1
what	1
forces	1
are	1
being	1
collected	1
against	1
him!	1
While	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
much	1
of	1
him."	1
	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
know	1
when	1
"you	1
and	1
I"	1
had	1
said	1
such	1
things	1
about	1
Bonaparte,	1
but	1
understanding	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wanted	1
as	1
a	1
peg	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
hang	1
the	1
prince's	1
favorite	1
topic,	1
he	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
prince,	1
wondering	1
what	1
would	1
follow.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
tactician!"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
his	1
son,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
architect.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
conversation	1
again	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
war,	1
on	1
Bonaparte,	1
and	1
the	1
generals	1
and	1
statesmen	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
seemed	1
convinced	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
mere	1
babies	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
A	1
B	1
C	1
of	1
war	1
or	1
of	1
politics,	1
and	1
that	1
Bonaparte	1
was	1
an	1
insignificant	1
little	1
Frenchy,	1
successful	1
only	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
Potemkins	1
or	1
Suvorovs	1
left	1
to	1
oppose	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
convinced	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
political	1
difficulties	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
no	1
real	1
war,	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
puppet	1
show	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
playing,	1
pretending	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
real.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gaily	1
bore	1
with	1
his	1
father's	1
ridicule	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
men,	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
on	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
evident	1
pleasure.	1
	1
"The	1
past	1
always	1
seems	1
good,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
did	1
not	1
Suvorov	1
himself	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
trap	1
Moreau	1
set	1
him,	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
escape?"	1
	1
"Who	1
told	1
you	1
that?	1
Who?"	1
cried	1
the	1
prince.	1
"Suvorov!"	1
And	1
he	1
jerked	1
away	1
his	1
plate,	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
briskly	1
caught.	1
"Suvorov!...	1
Consider,	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
Two...	1
Frederick	1
and	1
Suvorov;	1
Moreau!...	1
Moreau	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
prisoner	1
if	1
Suvorov	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
free	1
hand;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath	1
on	1
his	1
hands.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
puzzled	1
the	1
devil	1
himself!	1
When	1
you	1
get	1
there	1
you'll	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
those	1
Hofs-	1
kriegs-wurst-Raths	1
are!	1
Suvorov	1
couldn't	1
manage	1
them	1
so	1
what	1
chance	1
has	1
Michael	1
Kutuzov?	1
No,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"you	1
and	1
your	1
generals	1
won't	1
get	1
on	1
against	1
Buonaparte;	1
you'll	1
have	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
the	1
French,	1
so	1
that	1
birds	1
of	1
a	1
feather	1
may	1
fight	1
together.	1
The	1
German,	1
Pahlen,	1
has	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
New	1
York	1
in	1
America,	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
Moreau,"	1
he	1
said,	1
alluding	1
to	1
the	1
invitation	1
made	1
that	1
year	1
to	1
Moreau	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
Russian	1
service....	1
"Wonderful!...	1
Were	1
the	1
Potemkins,	1
Suvorovs,	1
and	1
Orlovs	1
Germans?	1
No,	1
lad,	1
either	1
you	1
fellows	1
have	1
all	1
lost	1
your	1
wits,	1
or	1
I	1
have	1
outlived	1
mine.	1
May	1
God	1
help	1
you,	1
but	1
we'll	1
see	1
what	1
will	1
happen.	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
great	1
commander	1
among	1
them!	1
Hm!..."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
at	1
all	1
say	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
plans	1
are	1
good,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
surprised	1
at	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
Bonaparte.	1
You	1
may	1
laugh	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
like,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
Bonaparte	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
general!"	1
	1
"Michael	1
Ivanovich!"	1
cried	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
the	1
architect	1
who,	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
roast	1
meat,	1
hoped	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten:	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
Buonaparte	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
tactician?	1
Here,	1
he	1
says	1
the	1
same	1
thing."	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
the	1
architect.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
again	1
laughed	1
his	1
frigid	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Buonaparte	1
was	1
born	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
spoon	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
He	1
has	1
got	1
splendid	1
soldiers.	1
Besides	1
he	1
began	1
by	1
attacking	1
Germans.	1
And	1
only	1
idlers	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
beat	1
the	1
Germans.	1
Since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
everybody	1
has	1
beaten	1
the	1
Germans.	1
They	1
beat	1
no	1
one--except	1
one	1
another.	1
He	1
made	1
his	1
reputation	1
fighting	1
them."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
began	1
explaining	1
all	1
the	1
blunders	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
him,	1
Bonaparte	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
his	1
campaigns	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
politics.	1
His	1
son	1
made	1
no	1
rejoinder,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
whatever	1
arguments	1
were	1
presented	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
little	1
able	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
opinion.	1
He	1
listened,	1
refraining	1
from	1
a	1
reply,	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
wondered	1
how	1
this	1
old	1
man,	1
living	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years,	1
could	1
know	1
and	1
discuss	1
so	1
minutely	1
and	1
acutely	1
all	1
the	1
recent	1
European	1
military	1
and	1
political	1
events.	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
I'm	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
don't	1
understand	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
affairs?"	1
concluded	1
his	1
father.	1
"But	1
it	1
troubles	1
me.	1
I	1
don't	1
sleep	1
at	1
night.	1
Come	1
now,	1
where	1
has	1
this	1
great	1
commander	1
of	1
yours	1
shown	1
his	1
skill?"	1
he	1
concluded.	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
take	1
too	1
long	1
to	1
tell,"	1
answered	1
the	1
son.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then	1
go	1
to	1
your	1
Buonaparte!	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
here's	1
another	1
admirer	1
of	1
that	1
powder-monkey	1
emperor	1
of	1
yours,"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
excellent	1
French.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Prince,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
Bonapartist!"	1
	1
"Dieu	1
sait	1
quand	1
reviendra..."	1
hummed	1
the	1
prince	1
out	1
of	1
tune	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
still	1
more	1
so,	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
discussion	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
sat	1
silent,	1
glancing	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
look	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
father-in-	1
law	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
When	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
arm	1
and	1
drew	1
her	1
into	1
another	1
room.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
clever	1
man	1
your	1
father	1
is,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
kind!"	1
answered	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXVIII	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
next	1
evening.	1
The	1
old	1
prince,	1
not	1
altering	1
his	1
routine,	1
retired	1
as	1
usual	1
after	1
dinner.	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
a	1
traveling	1
coat	1
without	1
epaulettes	1
had	1
been	1
packing	1
with	1
his	1
valet	1
in	1
the	1
rooms	1
assigned	1
to	1
him.	1
After	1
inspecting	1
the	1
carriage	1
himself	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
trunks	1
put	1
in,	1
he	1
ordered	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
harnessed.	1
Only	1
those	1
things	1
he	1
always	1
kept	1
with	1
him	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
room;	1
a	1
small	1
box,	1
a	1
large	1
canteen	1
fitted	1
with	1
silver	1
plate,	1
two	1
Turkish	1
pistols	1
and	1
a	1
saber--a	1
present	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Ochakov.	1
All	1
these	1
traveling	1
effects	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
were	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
order:	1
new,	1
clean,	1
and	1
in	1
cloth	1
covers	1
carefully	1
tied	1
with	1
tapes.	1
	1
When	1
starting	1
on	1
a	1
journey	1
or	1
changing	1
their	1
mode	1
of	1
life,	1
men	1
capable	1
of	1
reflection	1
are	1
generally	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
frame	1
of	1
mind.	1
At	1
such	1
moments	1
one	1
reviews	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
looked	1
very	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
tender.	1
With	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
him	1
he	1
paced	1
briskly	1
from	1
corner	1
to	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
thoughtfully	1
shaking	1
his	1
head.	1
Did	1
he	1
fear	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
or	1
was	1
he	1
sad	1
at	1
leaving	1
his	1
wife?--perhaps	1
both,	1
but	1
evidently	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
that	1
mood,	1
for	1
hearing	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
he	1
hurriedly	1
unclasped	1
his	1
hands,	1
stopped	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
as	1
if	1
tying	1
the	1
cover	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
box,	1
and	1
assumed	1
his	1
usual	1
tranquil	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
expression.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
heavy	1
tread	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
he	1
heard.	1
	1
"I	1
hear	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
harness,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
panting	1
(she	1
had	1
apparently	1
been	1
running),	1
"and	1
I	1
did	1
so	1
wish	1
to	1
have	1
another	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
alone!	1
God	1
knows	1
how	1
long	1
we	1
may	1
again	1
be	1
parted.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
coming?	1
You	1
have	1
changed	1
so,	1
Andrusha,"	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
explain	1
such	1
a	1
question.	1
	1
She	1
smiled	1
as	1
she	1
uttered	1
his	1
pet	1
name,	1
"Andrusha."	1
It	1
was	1
obviously	1
strange	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
stern	1
handsome	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
Andrusha-	1
-the	1
slender	1
mischievous	1
boy	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
playfellow	1
in	1
childhood.	1
	1
"And	1
where	1
is	1
Lise?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
answering	1
her	1
question	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"She	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
my	1
room.	1
Oh,	1
Andrew!	1
What	1
a	1
treasure	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
you	1
have,"	1
said	1
she,	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
facing	1
her	1
brother.	1
"She	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
child:	1
such	1
a	1
dear,	1
merry	1
child.	1
I	1
have	1
grown	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
her."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
silent,	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
the	1
ironical	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
look	1
that	1
showed	1
itself	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"One	1
must	1
be	1
indulgent	1
to	1
little	1
weaknesses;	1
who	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
them,	1
Andrew?	1
Don't	1
forget	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
grown	1
up	1
and	1
been	1
educated	1
in	1
society,	1
and	1
so	1
her	1
position	1
now	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
rosy	1
one.	1
We	1
should	1
enter	1
into	1
everyone's	1
situation.	1
Tout	1
comprendre,	1
c'est	1
tout	1
pardonner.	1
*	1
Think	1
what	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
for	1
her,	1
poor	1
thing,	1
after	1
what	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
used	1
to,	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
in	1
her	1
condition!	1
It's	1
very	1
hard."	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
understand	1
all	1
is	1
to	1
forgive	1
all.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
sister,	1
as	1
we	1
smile	1
at	1
those	1
we	1
think	1
we	1
thoroughly	1
understand.	1
	1
"You	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
don't	1
think	1
the	1
life	1
terrible,"	1
he	1
replied.	1
	1
"I...	1
that's	1
different.	1
Why	1
speak	1
of	1
me?	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
any	1
other	1
life,	1
and	1
can't,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
other.	1
But	1
think,	1
Andrew:	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
society	1
woman	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
during	1
the	1
best	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
all	1
alone--for	1
Papa	1
is	1
always	1
busy,	1
and	1
I...	1
well,	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
poor	1
resources	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
entertaining	1
a	1
woman	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
society.	1
There	1
is	1
only	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne...."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
your	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"No?	1
She	1
is	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
kind	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
she's	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied.	1
She	1
has	1
no	1
one,	1
no	1
one.	1
To	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
don't	1
need	1
her,	1
and	1
she's	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
way.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
always	1
was	1
a	1
savage,	1
and	1
now	1
am	1
even	1
more	1
so.	1
I	1
like	1
being	1
alone....	1
Father	1
likes	1
her	1
very	1
much.	1
She	1
and	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
people	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
gentle	1
and	1
kind,	1
because	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
benefactor	1
to	1
them	1
both.	1
As	1
Sterne	1
says:	1
'We	1
don't	1
love	1
people	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
us,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
them.'	1
Father	1
took	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
homeless	1
after	1
losing	1
her	1
own	1
father.	1
She	1
is	1
very	1
good-natured,	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
likes	1
her	1
way	1
of	1
reading.	1
She	1
reads	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
evenings	1
and	1
reads	1
splendidly."	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
quite	1
frank,	1
Mary,	1
I	1
expect	1
Father's	1
character	1
sometimes	1
makes	1
things	1
trying	1
for	1
you,	1
doesn't	1
it?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
suddenly.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
first	1
surprised	1
and	1
then	1
aghast	1
at	1
this	1
question.	1
	1
"For	1
me?	1
For	1
me?...	1
Trying	1
for	1
me!..."	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"He	1
always	1
was	1
rather	1
harsh;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
he's	1
getting	1
very	1
trying,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
apparently	1
speaking	1
lightly	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
puzzle	1
or	1
test	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
good	1
in	1
every	1
way,	1
Andrew,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
intellectual	1
pride,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
following	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
trend	1
of	1
the	1
conversation--"and	1
that's	1
a	1
great	1
sin.	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
judge	1
Father?	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
one	1
might,	1
what	1
feeling	1
except	1
veneration	1
could	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
evoke?	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
contented	1
and	1
happy	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
you	1
were	1
all	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
I	1
am."	1
	1
Her	1
brother	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
incredulously.	1
	1
"The	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
me...	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
Andrew...	1
is	1
Father's	1
way	1
of	1
treating	1
religious	1
subjects.	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
how	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
immense	1
intellect	1
can	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
day,	1
and	1
can	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
astray.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
makes	1
me	1
unhappy.	1
But	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
lately	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
improvement.	1
His	1
satire	1
has	1
been	1
less	1
bitter	1
of	1
late,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
monk	1
he	1
received	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
talk	1
with."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
monk	1
are	1
wasting	1
your	1
powder,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
banteringly	1
yet	1
tenderly.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
mon	1
ami,	1
I	1
only	1
pray,	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
hear	1
me.	1
Andrew..."	1
she	1
said	1
timidly	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
silence,	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
favor	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
you."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
dear?"	1
	1
"No--promise	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
refuse!	1
It	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
trouble	1
and	1
is	1
nothing	1
unworthy	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
comfort	1
me.	1
Promise,	1
Andrusha!..."	1
said	1
she,	1
putting	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
her	1
reticule	1
but	1
not	1
yet	1
taking	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
inside	1
it,	1
as	1
if	1
what	1
she	1
held	1
were	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
her	1
request	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
shown	1
before	1
the	1
request	1
was	1
granted.	1
	1
She	1
looked	1
timidly	1
at	1
her	1
brother.	1
	1
"Even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
trouble..."	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
if	1
guessing	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
about.	1
	1
"Think	1
what	1
you	1
please!	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
just	1
like	1
Father.	1
Think	1
as	1
you	1
please,	1
but	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
sake!	1
Please	1
do!	1
Father's	1
father,	1
our	1
grandfather,	1
wore	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
wars."	1
(She	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
in	1
her	1
reticule.)	1
"So	1
you	1
promise?"	1
	1
"Of	1
course.	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
I	1
bless	1
you	1
with	1
this	1
icon	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
promise	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
take	1
it	1
off.	1
Do	1
you	1
promise?"	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
weigh	1
a	1
hundredweight	1
and	1
won't	1
break	1
my	1
neck...	1
To	1
please	1
you..."	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
But	1
immediately,	1
noticing	1
the	1
pained	1
expression	1
his	1
joke	1
had	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
sister's	1
face,	1
he	1
repented	1
and	1
added:	1
"I	1
am	1
glad;	1
really,	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad."	1
	1
"Against	1
your	1
will	1
He	1
will	1
save	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
Himself,	1
for	1
in	1
Him	1
alone	1
is	1
truth	1
and	1
peace,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
trembling	1
with	1
emotion,	1
solemnly	1
holding	1
up	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
before	1
her	1
brother	1
a	1
small,	1
oval,	1
antique,	1
dark-faced	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Saviour	1
in	1
a	1
gold	1
setting,	1
on	1
a	1
finely	1
wrought	1
silver	1
chain.	1
	1
She	1
crossed	1
herself,	1
kissed	1
the	1
icon,	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Please,	1
Andrew,	1
for	1
my	1
sake!..."	1
	1
Rays	1
of	1
gentle	1
light	1
shone	1
from	1
her	1
large,	1
timid	1
eyes.	1
Those	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1
thin,	1
sickly	1
face	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
beautiful.	1
Her	1
brother	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
icon,	1
but	1
she	1
stopped	1
him.	1
Andrew	1
understood,	1
crossed	1
himself	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
icon.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
tenderness,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
touched,	1
but	1
also	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
irony	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
my	1
dear."	1
She	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
	1
"As	1
I	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
you,	1
Andrew,	1
be	1
kind	1
and	1
generous	1
as	1
you	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
be.	1
Don't	1
judge	1
Lise	1
harshly,"	1
she	1
began.	1
"She	1
is	1
so	1
sweet,	1
so	1
good-	1
natured,	1
and	1
her	1
position	1
now	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
one."	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
complained	1
of	1
my	1
wife	1
to	1
you,	1
Masha,	1
or	1
blamed	1
her.	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
me?"	1
	1
Red	1
patches	1
appeared	1
on	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
guilty.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
talked	1
to.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
that,"	1
he	1
went	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
patches	1
grew	1
deeper	1
on	1
her	1
forehead,	1
neck,	1
and	1
cheeks.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
Her	1
brother	1
had	1
guessed	1
right:	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
been	1
crying	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
her	1
forebodings	1
about	1
her	1
confinement,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
dreaded	1
it,	1
and	1
had	1
complained	1
of	1
her	1
fate,	1
her	1
father-in-law,	1
and	1
her	1
husband.	1
After	1
crying	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"Know	1
this,	1
Masha:	1
I	1
can't	1
reproach,	1
have	1
not	1
reproached,	1
and	1
never	1
shall	1
reproach	1
my	1
wife	1
with	1
anything,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
reproach	1
myself	1
with	1
anything	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
that	1
always	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
in	1
whatever	1
circumstances	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
placed.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
truth...	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
happy?	1
No!	1
Is	1
she	1
happy?	1
No!	1
But	1
why	1
this	1
is	1
so	1
I	1
don't	1
know..."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
rose,	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
and,	1
stooping,	1
kissed	1
her	1
forehead.	1
His	1
fine	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful,	1
kindly,	1
and	1
unaccustomed	1
brightness,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
his	1
sister	1
but	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
toward	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
doorway.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
her,	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
good-by.	1
Or--go	1
and	1
wake	1
and	1
I'll	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
Petrushka!"	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
valet:	1
"Come	1
here,	1
take	1
these	1
away.	1
Put	1
this	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
right."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
rose	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
then	1
stopped	1
and	1
said:	1
"Andrew,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
faith	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
turned	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
asked	1
Him	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
love	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
feel,	1
and	1
your	1
prayer	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
answered."	1
	1
"Well,	1
may	1
be!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Go,	1
Masha;	1
I'll	1
come	1
immediately."	1
	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
sister's	1
room,	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
which	1
connected	1
one	1
wing	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
met	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
smiling	1
sweetly.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
that	1
day	1
that,	1
with	1
an	1
ecstatic	1
and	1
artless	1
smile,	1
she	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
secluded	1
passages.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
your	1
room,"	1
she	1
said,	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
blushing	1
and	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
anger	1
suddenly	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
forehead	1
and	1
hair,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
eyes,	1
with	1
such	1
contempt	1
that	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
blushed	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
his	1
sister's	1
room	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
already	1
awake	1
and	1
her	1
merry	1
voice,	1
hurrying	1
one	1
word	1
after	1
another,	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
door.	1
She	1
was	1
speaking	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
French,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
after	1
long	1
self-restraint	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
lost	1
time.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
imagine	1
the	1
old	1
Countess	1
Zubova,	1
with	1
false	1
curls	1
and	1
her	1
mouth	1
full	1
of	1
false	1
teeth,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
cheat	1
old	1
age....	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!	1
Mary!"	1
	1
This	1
very	1
sentence	1
about	1
Countess	1
Zubova	1
and	1
this	1
same	1
laugh	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
others	1
some	1
five	1
times.	1
He	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
softly.	1
The	1
little	1
princess,	1
plump	1
and	1
rosy,	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
with	1
her	1
work	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
talking	1
incessantly,	1
repeating	1
Petersburg	1
reminiscences	1
and	1
even	1
phrases.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
up,	1
stroked	1
her	1
hair,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
rested	1
after	1
their	1
journey.	1
She	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
continued	1
her	1
chatter.	1
	1
The	1
coach	1
with	1
six	1
horses	1
was	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
porch.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
autumn	1
night,	1
so	1
dark	1
that	1
the	1
coachman	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
carriage	1
pole.	1
Servants	1
with	1
lanterns	1
were	1
bustling	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
porch.	1
The	1
immense	1
house	1
was	1
brilliant	1
with	1
lights	1
shining	1
through	1
its	1
lofty	1
windows.	1
The	1
domestic	1
serfs	1
were	1
crowding	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
waiting	1
to	1
bid	1
good-by	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
prince.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
were	1
all	1
gathered	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
hall:	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
study	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
good-by	1
to	1
him	1
alone.	1
All	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
out.	1
	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
study	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
old-age	1
spectacles	1
and	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
received	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
his	1
son,	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
writing.	1
He	1
glanced	1
round.	1
	1
"Going?"	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
writing.	1
	1
"I've	1
come	1
to	1
say	1
good-by."	1
	1
"Kiss	1
me	1
here,"	1
and	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
cheek:	1
"Thanks,	1
thanks!"	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
thank	1
me	1
for?"	1
	1
"For	1
not	1
dilly-dallying	1
and	1
not	1
hanging	1
to	1
a	1
woman's	1
apron	1
strings.	1
The	1
Service	1
before	1
everything.	1
Thanks,	1
thanks!"	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
writing,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
quill	1
spluttered	1
and	1
squeaked.	1
"If	1
you	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
say,	1
say	1
it.	1
These	1
two	1
things	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
together,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"About	1
my	1
wife...	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
on	1
your	1
hands..."	1
	1
"Why	1
talk	1
nonsense?	1
Say	1
what	1
you	1
want."	1
	1
"When	1
her	1
confinement	1
is	1
due,	1
send	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
an	1
accoucheur....	1
Let	1
him	1
be	1
here...."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
stopped	1
writing	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
understanding,	1
fixed	1
his	1
stern	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
help	1
if	1
nature	1
does	1
not	1
do	1
her	1
work,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
evidently	1
confused.	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
million	1
cases	1
only	1
one	1
goes	1
wrong,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
fancy	1
and	1
mine.	1
They	1
have	1
been	1
telling	1
her	1
things.	1
She	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
is	1
frightened."	1
	1
"Hm...	1
Hm..."	1
muttered	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
himself,	1
finishing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
writing.	1
"I'll	1
do	1
it."	1
	1
He	1
signed	1
with	1
a	1
flourish	1
and	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
bad	1
business,	1
eh?"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
bad,	1
Father?"	1
	1
"The	1
wife!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
briefly	1
and	1
significantly.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped,	1
lad,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"They're	1
all	1
like	1
that;	1
one	1
can't	1
unmarry.	1
Don't	1
be	1
afraid;	1
I	1
won't	1
tell	1
anyone,	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
yourself."	1
	1
He	1
seized	1
his	1
son	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
small	1
bony	1
fingers,	1
shook	1
it,	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
son's	1
face	1
with	1
keen	1
eyes	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
through	1
him,	1
and	1
again	1
laughed	1
his	1
frigid	1
laugh.	1
	1
The	1
son	1
sighed,	1
thus	1
admitting	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
understood	1
him.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
continued	1
to	1
fold	1
and	1
seal	1
his	1
letter,	1
snatching	1
up	1
and	1
throwing	1
down	1
the	1
wax,	1
the	1
seal,	1
and	1
the	1
paper,	1
with	1
his	1
accustomed	1
rapidity.	1
	1
"What's	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
She's	1
pretty!	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
everything.	1
Make	1
your	1
mind	1
easy,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
abrupt	1
sentences	1
while	1
sealing	1
his	1
letter.	1
	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
speak;	1
he	1
was	1
both	1
pleased	1
and	1
displeased	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
understood	1
him.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"Listen!"	1
said	1
he;	1
"don't	1
worry	1
about	1
your	1
wife:	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
shall	1
be.	1
Now	1
listen!	1
Give	1
this	1
letter	1
to	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich.	1
*	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
proper	1
places	1
and	1
not	1
keep	1
you	1
long	1
as	1
an	1
adjutant:	1
a	1
bad	1
position!	1
Tell	1
him	1
I	1
remember	1
and	1
like	1
him.	1
Write	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
he	1
receives	1
you.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
all	1
right--serve	1
him.	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski's	1
son	1
need	1
not	1
serve	1
under	1
anyone	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
disfavor.	1
Now	1
come	1
here."	1
	1
	1
*Kutuzov.	1
	1
He	1
spoke	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
half	1
his	1
words,	1
but	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
understand	1
him.	1
He	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
desk,	1
raised	1
the	1
lid,	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
drawer,	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
an	1
exercise	1
book	1
filled	1
with	1
his	1
bold,	1
tall,	1
close	1
handwriting.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
probably	1
die	1
before	1
you.	1
So	1
remember,	1
these	1
are	1
my	1
memoirs;	1
hand	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
after	1
my	1
death.	1
Now	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
Lombard	1
bond	1
and	1
a	1
letter;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
premium	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
writes	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
Suvorov's	1
wars.	1
Send	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Academy.	1
Here	1
are	1
some	1
jottings	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
read	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
gone.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
them	1
useful."	1
	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
his	1
father	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
live	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
yet.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
it.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
all,	1
Father,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now,	1
good-by!"	1
He	1
gave	1
his	1
son	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
kiss,	1
and	1
embraced	1
him.	1
"Remember	1
this,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
if	1
they	1
kill	1
you	1
it	1
will	1
hurt	1
me,	1
your	1
old	1
father..."	1
he	1
paused	1
unexpectedly,	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
a	1
querulous	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
shrieked:	1
"but	1
if	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
behaved	1
like	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed!"	1
	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
to	1
me,	1
Father,"	1
said	1
the	1
son	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
silent.	1
	1
"I	1
also	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"if	1
I'm	1
killed	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
son,	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
you--as	1
I	1
said	1
yesterday...	1
let	1
him	1
grow	1
up	1
with	1
you....	1
Please."	1
	1
"Not	1
let	1
the	1
wife	1
have	1
him?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
laughed.	1
	1
They	1
stood	1
silent,	1
facing	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
old	1
man's	1
sharp	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
straight	1
on	1
his	1
son's.	1
Something	1
twitched	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
face.	1
	1
"We've	1
said	1
good-by.	1
Go!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
loud,	1
angry	1
voice,	1
opening	1
his	1
door.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
What?"	1
asked	1
both	1
princesses	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
spectacled	1
and	1
wigless,	1
shouting	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
voice.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sighed	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"Well!"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
And	1
this	1
"Well!"	1
sounded	1
coldly	1
ironic,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
saying,:	1
"Now	1
go	1
through	1
your	1
performance."	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
already!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
turning	1
pale	1
and	1
looking	1
with	1
dismay	1
at	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
He	1
embraced	1
her.	1
She	1
screamed	1
and	1
fell	1
unconscious	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
	1
He	1
cautiously	1
released	1
the	1
shoulder	1
she	1
leaned	1
on,	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
carefully	1
placed	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair.	1
	1
"Adieu,	1
Mary,"	1
said	1
he	1
gently	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
taking	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
kissing	1
her,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
armchair,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
chafing	1
her	1
temples.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
supporting	1
her	1
sister-in-law,	1
still	1
looked	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
through	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
in	1
his	1
direction.	1
From	1
the	1
study,	1
like	1
pistol	1
shots,	1
came	1
the	1
frequent	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
angrily	1
blowing	1
his	1
nose.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gone	1
when	1
the	1
study	1
door	1
opened	1
quickly	1
and	1
the	1
stern	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown	1
looked	1
out.	1
	1
"Gone?	1
That's	1
all	1
right!"	1
said	1
he;	1
and	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
unconscious	1
little	1
princess,	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
reprovingly	1
and	1
slammed	1
the	1
door.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
In	1
October,	1
1805,	1
a	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
occupying	1
the	1
villages	1
and	1
towns	1
of	1
the	1
Archduchy	1
of	1
Austria,	1
and	1
yet	1
other	1
regiments	1
freshly	1
arriving	1
from	1
Russia	1
were	1
settling	1
near	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
Braunau	1
and	1
burdening	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
on	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
quartered.	1
Braunau	1
was	1
the	1
headquarters	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
On	1
October	1
11,	1
1805,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
infantry	1
regiments	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
reached	1
Braunau	1
had	1
halted	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
town,	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
inspected	1
by	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
Despite	1
the	1
un-Russian	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
locality	1
and	1
surroundings--fruit	1
gardens,	1
stone	1
fences,	1
tiled	1
roofs,	1
and	1
hills	1
in	1
the	1
distance--and	1
despite	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
(who	1
gazed	1
with	1
curiosity	1
at	1
the	1
soldiers)	1
were	1
not	1
Russians,	1
the	1
regiment	1
had	1
just	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
any	1
Russian	1
regiment	1
preparing	1
for	1
an	1
inspection	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Russia.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
day's	1
march	1
an	1
order	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
would	1
inspect	1
the	1
regiment	1
on	1
the	1
march.	1
Though	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
were	1
not	1
clear	1
to	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
arose	1
whether	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
marching	1
order	1
or	1
not,	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
at	1
a	1
consultation	1
between	1
the	1
battalion	1
commanders	1
to	1
present	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
parade	1
order,	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
better	1
to	1
"bow	1
too	1
low	1
than	1
not	1
bow	1
low	1
enough."	1
So	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
after	1
a	1
twenty-mile	1
march,	1
were	1
kept	1
mending	1
and	1
cleaning	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
without	1
closing	1
their	1
eyes,	1
while	1
the	1
adjutants	1
and	1
company	1
commanders	1
calculated	1
and	1
reckoned,	1
and	1
by	1
morning	1
the	1
regiment--instead	1
of	1
the	1
straggling,	1
disorderly	1
crowd	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
its	1
last	1
march	1
the	1
day	1
before--presented	1
a	1
well-ordered	1
array	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
each	1
of	1
whom	1
knew	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
his	1
duty,	1
had	1
every	1
button	1
and	1
every	1
strap	1
in	1
place,	1
and	1
shone	1
with	1
cleanliness.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
externally	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
order,	1
but	1
had	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
to	1
look	1
under	1
the	1
uniforms	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
clean	1
shirt,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
knapsack	1
the	1
appointed	1
number	1
of	1
articles,	1
"awl,	1
soap,	1
and	1
all,"	1
as	1
the	1
soldiers	1
say.	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
circumstance	1
concerning	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
be	1
at	1
ease.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
boots.	1
More	1
than	1
half	1
the	1
men's	1
boots	1
were	1
in	1
holes.	1
But	1
this	1
defect	1
was	1
not	1
due	1
to	1
any	1
fault	1
of	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
for	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
repeated	1
demands	1
boots	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
issued	1
by	1
the	1
Austrian	1
commissariat,	1
and	1
the	1
regiment	1
had	1
marched	1
some	1
seven	1
hundred	1
miles.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
an	1
elderly,	1
choleric,	1
stout,	1
and	1
thick-set	1
general	1
with	1
grizzled	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
whiskers,	1
and	1
wider	1
from	1
chest	1
to	1
back	1
than	1
across	1
the	1
shoulders.	1
He	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
brand-new	1
uniform	1
showing	1
the	1
creases	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
folded	1
and	1
thick	1
gold	1
epaulettes	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
stand	1
rather	1
than	1
lie	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
massive	1
shoulders.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
happily	1
performing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
solemn	1
duties	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
walked	1
about	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
pulled	1
himself	1
up,	1
slightly	1
arching	1
his	1
back.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
admired	1
his	1
regiment,	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
mind	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
it,	1
yet	1
his	1
strut	1
seemed	1
to	1
indicate	1
that,	1
besides	1
military	1
matters,	1
social	1
interests	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
sex	1
occupied	1
no	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Michael	1
Mitrich,	1
sir?"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
battalion	1
commanders	1
who	1
smilingly	1
pressed	1
forward	1
(it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
felt	1
happy).	1
"We	1
had	1
our	1
hands	1
full	1
last	1
night.	1
However,	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
regiment	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
one,	1
eh?"	1
	1
The	1
battalion	1
commander	1
perceived	1
the	1
jovial	1
irony	1
and	1
laughed.	1
	1
"It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
turned	1
off	1
the	1
field	1
even	1
on	1
the	1
Tsaritsin	1
Meadow."	1
	1
"What?"	1
asked	1
the	1
commander.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
on	1
which	1
signalers	1
had	1
been	1
posted,	1
two	1
men	1
appeared	1
on	1
horse	1
back.	1
They	1
were	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
	1
The	1
aide-de-camp	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
order	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
clearly	1
worded	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
namely,	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
regiment	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
march:	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats,	1
and	1
packs,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
preparation	1
whatever.	1
	1
A	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
from	1
Vienna	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
with	1
proposals	1
and	1
demands	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
join	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
Mack,	1
and	1
Kutuzov,	1
not	1
considering	1
this	1
junction	1
advisable,	1
meant,	1
among	1
other	1
arguments	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
view,	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
the	1
wretched	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
arrived	1
from	1
Russia.	1
With	1
this	1
object	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
regiment;	1
so	1
the	1
worse	1
the	1
condition	1
it	1
was	1
in,	1
the	1
better	1
pleased	1
the	1
commander-	1
in-chief	1
would	1
be.	1
Though	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
he	1
nevertheless	1
delivered	1
the	1
definite	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats	1
and	1
in	1
marching	1
order,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
would	1
otherwise	1
be	1
dissatisfied.	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
hung	1
his	1
head,	1
silently	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
with	1
a	1
choleric	1
gesture.	1
	1
"A	1
fine	1
mess	1
we've	1
made	1
of	1
it!"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
	1
"There	1
now!	1
Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Michael	1
Mitrich,	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
'on	1
the	1
march'	1
it	1
meant	1
in	1
greatcoats?"	1
said	1
he	1
reproachfully	1
to	1
the	1
battalion	1
commander.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God!"	1
he	1
added,	1
stepping	1
resolutely	1
forward.	1
"Company	1
commanders!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
accustomed	1
to	1
command.	1
"Sergeants	1
major!...	1
How	1
soon	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
with	1
a	1
respectful	1
politeness	1
evidently	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
personage	1
he	1
was	1
referring	1
to.	1
	1
"In	1
an	1
hour's	1
time,	1
I	1
should	1
say."	1
	1
"Shall	1
we	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
change	1
clothes?"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,	1
General...."	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
line	1
himself,	1
ordered	1
the	1
soldiers	1
to	1
change	1
into	1
their	1
greatcoats.	1
The	1
company	1
commanders	1
ran	1
off	1
to	1
their	1
companies,	1
the	1
sergeants	1
major	1
began	1
bustling	1
(the	1
greatcoats	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
condition),	1
and	1
instantly	1
the	1
squares	1
that	1
had	1
up	1
to	1
then	1
been	1
in	1
regular	1
order	1
and	1
silent	1
began	1
to	1
sway	1
and	1
stretch	1
and	1
hum	1
with	1
voices.	1
On	1
all	1
sides	1
soldiers	1
were	1
running	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
throwing	1
up	1
their	1
knapsacks	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
of	1
their	1
shoulders	1
and	1
pulling	1
the	1
straps	1
over	1
their	1
heads,	1
unstrapping	1
their	1
overcoats	1
and	1
drawing	1
the	1
sleeves	1
on	1
with	1
upraised	1
arms.	1
	1
In	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
all	1
was	1
again	1
in	1
order,	1
only	1
the	1
squares	1
had	1
become	1
gray	1
instead	1
of	1
black.	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
walked	1
with	1
his	1
jerky	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
examined	1
it	1
from	1
a	1
distance.	1
	1
"Whatever	1
is	1
this?	1
This!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
and	1
stood	1
still.	1
"Commander	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company!"	1
	1
"Commander	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
wanted	1
by	1
the	1
general!...	1
commander	1
to	1
the	1
general...	1
third	1
company	1
to	1
the	1
commander."	1
The	1
words	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
lines	1
and	1
an	1
adjutant	1
ran	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
missing	1
officer.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
eager	1
but	1
misrepeated	1
words	1
had	1
reached	1
their	1
destination	1
in	1
a	1
cry	1
of:	1
"The	1
general	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
company,"	1
the	1
missing	1
officer	1
appeared	1
from	1
behind	1
his	1
company	1
and,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
middle-aged	1
man	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
running,	1
trotted	1
awkwardly	1
stumbling	1
on	1
his	1
toes	1
toward	1
the	1
general.	1
The	1
captain's	1
face	1
showed	1
the	1
uneasiness	1
of	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
who	1
is	1
told	1
to	1
repeat	1
a	1
lesson	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
learned.	1
Spots	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
nose,	1
the	1
redness	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
evidently	1
due	1
to	1
intemperance,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
twitched	1
nervously.	1
The	1
general	1
looked	1
the	1
captain	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
panting,	1
slackening	1
his	1
pace	1
as	1
he	1
approached.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
dressing	1
your	1
men	1
in	1
petticoats!	1
What	1
is	1
this?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
thrusting	1
forward	1
his	1
jaw	1
and	1
pointing	1
at	1
a	1
soldier	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
in	1
a	1
greatcoat	1
of	1
bluish	1
cloth,	1
which	1
contrasted	1
with	1
the	1
others.	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
after?	1
The	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
is	1
expected	1
and	1
you	1
leave	1
your	1
place?	1
Eh?	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
dress	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
fancy	1
coats	1
for	1
a	1
parade....	1
Eh...?"	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
his	1
superior,	1
pressed	1
two	1
fingers	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rigidly	1
to	1
his	1
cap,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
this	1
pressure	1
lay	1
his	1
only	1
hope	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
"Well,	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak?	1
Whom	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
there	1
dressed	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
Hungarian?"	1
said	1
the	1
commander	1
with	1
an	1
austere	1
gibe.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
what?	1
Your	1
excellency!	1
But	1
what	1
about	1
your	1
excellency?...	1
nobody	1
knows."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
it's	1
the	1
officer	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks,"	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
softly.	1
	1
"Well?	1
Has	1
he	1
been	1
degraded	1
into	1
a	1
field	1
marshal,	1
or	1
into	1
a	1
soldier?	1
If	1
a	1
soldier,	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
dressed	1
in	1
regulation	1
uniform	1
like	1
the	1
others."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
you	1
gave	1
him	1
leave	1
yourself,	1
on	1
the	1
march."	1
	1
"Gave	1
him	1
leave?	1
Leave?	1
That's	1
just	1
like	1
you	1
young	1
men,"	1
said	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
cooling	1
down	1
a	1
little.	1
"Leave	1
indeed....	1
One	1
says	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
you...	1
What?"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
renewed	1
irritation,	1
"I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
dress	1
your	1
men	1
decently."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
commander,	1
turning	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
adjutant,	1
directed	1
his	1
jerky	1
steps	1
down	1
the	1
line.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
display	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
walking	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
regiment	1
wished	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
further	1
excuse	1
for	1
wrath.	1
Having	1
snapped	1
at	1
an	1
officer	1
for	1
an	1
unpolished	1
badge,	1
at	1
another	1
because	1
his	1
line	1
was	1
not	1
straight,	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
third	1
company.	1
	1
"H-o-o-w	1
are	1
you	1
standing?	1
Where's	1
your	1
leg?	1
Your	1
leg?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
commander	1
with	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
suffering	1
in	1
his	1
voice,	1
while	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
five	1
men	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
his	1
bluish-gray	1
uniform.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
slowly	1
straightened	1
his	1
bent	1
knee,	1
looking	1
straight	1
with	1
his	1
clear,	1
insolent	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
general's	1
face.	1
	1
"Why	1
a	1
blue	1
coat?	1
Off	1
with	1
it...	1
Sergeant	1
major!	1
Change	1
his	1
coat...	1
the	1
ras..."	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish.	1
	1
"General,	1
I	1
must	1
obey	1
orders,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
endure..."	1
Dolokhov	1
hurriedly	1
interrupted.	1
	1
"No	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
ranks!...	1
No	1
talking,	1
no	1
talking!"	1
	1
"Not	1
bound	1
to	1
endure	1
insults,"	1
Dolokhov	1
concluded	1
in	1
loud,	1
ringing	1
tones.	1
	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
the	1
soldier	1
met.	1
The	1
general	1
became	1
silent,	1
angrily	1
pulling	1
down	1
his	1
tight	1
scarf.	1
	1
"I	1
request	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
change	1
your	1
coat,"	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
"He's	1
coming!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
signaler	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
flushing,	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
horse,	1
seized	1
the	1
stirrup	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands,	1
threw	1
his	1
body	1
across	1
the	1
saddle,	1
righted	1
himself,	1
drew	1
his	1
saber,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
resolute	1
countenance,	1
opening	1
his	1
mouth	1
awry,	1
prepared	1
to	1
shout.	1
The	1
regiment	1
fluttered	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
preening	1
its	1
plumage	1
and	1
became	1
motionless.	1
	1
"Att-ention!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
in	1
a	1
soul-shaking	1
voice	1
which	1
expressed	1
joy	1
for	1
himself,	1
severity	1
for	1
the	1
regiment,	1
and	1
welcome	1
for	1
the	1
approaching	1
chief.	1
	1
Along	1
the	1
broad	1
country	1
road,	1
edged	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
by	1
trees,	1
came	1
a	1
high,	1
light	1
blue	1
Viennese	1
caleche,	1
slightly	1
creaking	1
on	1
its	1
springs	1
and	1
drawn	1
by	1
six	1
horses	1
at	1
a	1
smart	1
trot.	1
Behind	1
the	1
caleche	1
galloped	1
the	1
suite	1
and	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
Croats.	1
Beside	1
Kutuzov	1
sat	1
an	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
uniform	1
that	1
looked	1
strange	1
among	1
the	1
Russian	1
black	1
ones.	1
The	1
caleche	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
regiment.	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
were	1
talking	1
in	1
low	1
voices	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
smiled	1
slightly	1
as	1
treading	1
heavily	1
he	1
stepped	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
those	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
breathlessly	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
did	1
not	1
exist.	1
	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
rang	1
out,	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
regiment	1
quivered,	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
jingling	1
sound	1
it	1
presented	1
arms.	1
Then	1
amidst	1
a	1
dead	1
silence	1
the	1
feeble	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was	1
heard.	1
The	1
regiment	1
roared,	1
"Health	1
to	1
your	1
ex...	1
len...	1
len...	1
lency!"	1
and	1
again	1
all	1
became	1
silent.	1
At	1
first	1
Kutuzov	1
stood	1
still	1
while	1
the	1
regiment	1
moved;	1
then	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
in	1
white,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
suite,	1
walked	1
between	1
the	1
ranks.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
saluted	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
and	1
devoured	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
eyes,	1
drawing	1
himself	1
up	1
obsequiously,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
ranks	1
behind	1
the	1
generals,	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
jerky	1
movements,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
darted	1
forward	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
or	1
gesture	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
performed	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
subordinate	1
with	1
even	1
greater	1
zeal	1
than	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
commander.	1
Thanks	1
to	1
the	1
strictness	1
and	1
assiduity	1
of	1
its	1
commander	1
the	1
regiment,	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
others	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
Braunau	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
was	1
in	1
splendid	1
condition.	1
There	1
were	1
only	1
217	1
sick	1
and	1
stragglers.	1
Everything	1
was	1
in	1
good	1
order	1
except	1
the	1
boots.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
ranks,	1
sometimes	1
stopping	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
friendly	1
words	1
to	1
officers	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
Turkish	1
war,	1
sometimes	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
Looking	1
at	1
their	1
boots	1
he	1
several	1
times	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
sadly,	1
pointing	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
blaming	1
anyone,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
noticing	1
what	1
a	1
bad	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
it	1
was.	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
ran	1
forward	1
on	1
each	1
such	1
occasion,	1
fearing	1
to	1
miss	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
regarding	1
the	1
regiment.	1
Behind	1
Kutuzov,	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
that	1
allowed	1
every	1
softly	1
spoken	1
word	1
to	1
be	1
heard,	1
followed	1
some	1
twenty	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
suite.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
talked	1
among	1
themselves	1
and	1
sometimes	1
laughed.	1
Nearest	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
walked	1
a	1
handsome	1
adjutant.	1
This	1
was	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski.	1
Beside	1
him	1
was	1
his	1
comrade	1
Nesvitski,	1
a	1
tall	1
staff	1
officer,	1
extremely	1
stout,	1
with	1
a	1
kindly,	1
smiling,	1
handsome	1
face	1
and	1
moist	1
eyes.	1
Nesvitski	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
from	1
laughter	1
provoked	1
by	1
a	1
swarthy	1
hussar	1
officer	1
who	1
walked	1
beside	1
him.	1
This	1
hussar,	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
face	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
smile	1
or	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
fixed	1
eyes,	1
watched	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander's	1
back	1
and	1
mimicked	1
his	1
every	1
movement.	1
Each	1
time	1
the	1
commander	1
started	1
and	1
bent	1
forward,	1
the	1
hussar	1
started	1
and	1
bent	1
forward	1
in	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
manner.	1
Nesvitski	1
laughed	1
and	1
nudged	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
wag.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
walked	1
slowly	1
and	1
languidly	1
past	1
thousands	1
of	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
starting	1
from	1
their	1
sockets	1
to	1
watch	1
their	1
chief.	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
he	1
suddenly	1
stopped.	1
His	1
suite,	1
not	1
having	1
expected	1
this,	1
involuntarily	1
came	1
closer	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Timokhin!"	1
said	1
he,	1
recognizing	1
the	1
red-nosed	1
captain	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
reprimanded	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
blue	1
greatcoat.	1
	1
One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
more	1
than	1
Timokhin	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
reprimanded	1
by	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
addressed	1
him	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
extent	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
sustained	1
it	1
had	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
evidently	1
understood	1
his	1
case	1
and	1
wished	1
him	1
nothing	1
but	1
good,	1
quickly	1
turned	1
away,	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
flitting	1
over	1
his	1
scarred	1
and	1
puffy	1
face.	1
	1
"Another	1
Ismail	1
comrade,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"A	1
brave	1
officer!	1
Are	1
you	1
satisfied	1
with	1
him?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
latter--unconscious	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
hussar	1
officer	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
looking	1
glass--started,	1
moved	1
forward,	1
and	1
answered:	1
"Highly	1
satisfied,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
	1
"We	1
all	1
have	1
our	1
weaknesses,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
smiling	1
and	1
walking	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
"He	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
predilection	1
for	1
Bacchus."	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
was	1
afraid	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
blamed	1
for	1
this	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
The	1
hussar	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
noticed	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
red-nosed	1
captain	1
and	1
his	1
drawn-in	1
stomach,	1
and	1
mimicked	1
his	1
expression	1
and	1
pose	1
with	1
such	1
exactitude	1
that	1
Nesvitski	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
Kutuzov	1
turned	1
round.	1
The	1
officer	1
evidently	1
had	1
complete	1
control	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
while	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
turning	1
managed	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
grimace	1
and	1
then	1
assume	1
a	1
most	1
serious,	1
deferential,	1
and	1
innocent	1
expression.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
company	1
was	1
the	1
last,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
pondered,	1
apparently	1
trying	1
to	1
recollect	1
something.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stepped	1
forward	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
suite	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
"You	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
remind	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
officer	1
Dolokhov,	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
in	1
this	1
regiment."	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
Dolokhov?"	1
asked	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
soldier's	1
gray	1
greatcoat,	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
be	1
called.	1
The	1
shapely	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
fair-haired	1
soldier,	1
with	1
his	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
stepped	1
forward	1
from	1
the	1
ranks,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief,	1
and	1
presented	1
arms.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
a	1
complaint	1
to	1
make?"	1
Kutuzov	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
frown.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
Dolokhov,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov.	1
"I	1
hope	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
you.	1
Do	1
your	1
duty.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
is	1
gracious,	1
and	1
I	1
shan't	1
forget	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
deserve	1
well."	1
	1
The	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
just	1
as	1
boldly	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
seeming	1
by	1
their	1
expression	1
to	1
tear	1
open	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
convention	1
that	1
separates	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
so	1
widely	1
from	1
a	1
private.	1
	1
"One	1
thing	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
Dolokhov	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
firm,	1
ringing,	1
deliberate	1
voice.	1
"I	1
ask	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
my	1
fault	1
and	1
prove	1
my	1
devotion	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
to	1
Russia!"	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
turned	1
away.	1
The	1
same	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
Captain	1
Timokhin	1
again	1
flitted	1
over	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
grimace	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
everything	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
everything	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
weary	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
carriage.	1
	1
The	1
regiment	1
broke	1
up	1
into	1
companies,	1
which	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
appointed	1
quarters	1
near	1
Braunau,	1
where	1
they	1
hoped	1
to	1
receive	1
boots	1
and	1
clothes	1
and	1
to	1
rest	1
after	1
their	1
hard	1
marches.	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
bear	1
me	1
a	1
grudge,	1
Prokhor	1
Ignatych?"	1
said	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
overtaking	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
its	1
quarters	1
and	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
Captain	1
Timokhin	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
front.	1
(The	1
regimental	1
commander's	1
face	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
inspection	1
was	1
happily	1
over	1
beamed	1
with	1
irrepressible	1
delight.)	1
"It's	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
service...	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped...	1
one	1
is	1
sometimes	1
a	1
bit	1
hasty	1
on	1
parade...	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
apologize,	1
you	1
know	1
me!...	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
pleased!"	1
And	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
captain.	1
	1
"Don't	1
mention	1
it,	1
General,	1
as	1
if	1
I'd	1
be	1
so	1
bold!"	1
replied	1
the	1
captain,	1
his	1
nose	1
growing	1
redder	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
smile	1
which	1
showed	1
where	1
two	1
front	1
teeth	1
were	1
missing	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
knocked	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
butt	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
gun	1
at	1
Ismail.	1
	1
"And	1
tell	1
Mr.	1
Dolokhov	1
that	1
I	1
won't	1
forget	1
him--he	1
may	1
be	1
quite	1
easy.	1
And	1
tell	1
me,	1
please--I've	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
ask--how	1
is	1
he	1
behaving	1
himself,	1
and	1
in	1
general..."	1
	1
"As	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
service	1
goes	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
punctilious,	1
your	1
excellency;	1
but	1
his	1
character..."	1
said	1
Timokhin.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
about	1
his	1
character?"	1
asked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
	1
"It's	1
different	1
on	1
different	1
days,"	1
answered	1
the	1
captain.	1
"One	1
day	1
he	1
is	1
sensible,	1
well	1
educated,	1
and	1
good-natured,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
he's	1
a	1
wild	1
beast....	1
In	1
Poland,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
he	1
nearly	1
killed	1
a	1
Jew."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
well,	1
well!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
"Still,	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
misfortune.	1
You	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
important	1
connections...	1
Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
just..."	1
	1
"I	1
will,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
Timokhin,	1
showing	1
by	1
his	1
smile	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
his	1
commander's	1
wish.	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course,	1
of	1
course!"	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
sought	1
out	1
Dolokhov	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
and,	1
reining	1
in	1
his	1
horse,	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
	1
"After	1
the	1
next	1
affair...	1
epaulettes."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
looked	1
round	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
anything,	1
nor	1
did	1
the	1
mocking	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
change.	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
all	1
right,"	1
continued	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
"A	1
cup	1
of	1
vodka	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
from	1
me,"	1
he	1
added	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
soldiers	1
could	1
hear.	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
all!	1
God	1
be	1
praised!"	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
past	1
that	1
company	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
next	1
one.	1
	1
"Well,	1
he's	1
really	1
a	1
good	1
fellow,	1
one	1
can	1
serve	1
under	1
him,"	1
said	1
Timokhin	1
to	1
the	1
subaltern	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
word,	1
a	1
hearty	1
one..."	1
said	1
the	1
subaltern,	1
laughing	1
(the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
was	1
nicknamed	1
King	1
of	1
Hearts).	1
	1
The	1
cheerful	1
mood	1
of	1
their	1
officers	1
after	1
the	1
inspection	1
infected	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
The	1
company	1
marched	1
on	1
gaily.	1
The	1
soldiers'	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
"And	1
they	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
blind	1
of	1
one	1
eye?"	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
he	1
is!	1
Quite	1
blind!"	1
	1
"No,	1
friend,	1
he	1
is	1
sharper-eyed	1
than	1
you	1
are.	1
Boots	1
and	1
leg	1
bands...	1
he	1
noticed	1
everything..."	1
	1
"When	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
my	1
feet,	1
friend...	1
well,	1
thinks	1
I..."	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
other	1
one	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
Austrian,	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
smeared	1
with	1
chalk--as	1
white	1
as	1
flour!	1
I	1
suppose	1
they	1
polish	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
the	1
guns."	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Fedeshon!...	1
Did	1
he	1
say	1
when	1
the	1
battles	1
are	1
to	1
begin?	1
You	1
were	1
near	1
him.	1
Everybody	1
said	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
himself	1
was	1
at	1
Braunau."	1
	1
"Buonaparte	1
himself!...	1
Just	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
fool,	1
what	1
he	1
doesn't	1
know!	1
The	1
Prussians	1
are	1
up	1
in	1
arms	1
now.	1
The	1
Austrians,	1
you	1
see,	1
are	1
putting	1
them	1
down.	1
When	1
they've	1
been	1
put	1
down,	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Buonaparte	1
will	1
begin.	1
And	1
he	1
says	1
Buonaparte	1
is	1
in	1
Braunau!	1
Shows	1
you're	1
a	1
fool.	1
You'd	1
better	1
listen	1
more	1
carefully!"	1
	1
"What	1
devils	1
these	1
quartermasters	1
are!	1
See,	1
the	1
fifth	1
company	1
is	1
turning	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
already...	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
their	1
buckwheat	1
cooked	1
before	1
we	1
reach	1
our	1
quarters."	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
a	1
biscuit,	1
you	1
devil!"	1
	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
tobacco	1
yesterday?	1
That's	1
just	1
it,	1
friend!	1
Ah,	1
well,	1
never	1
mind,	1
here	1
you	1
are."	1
	1
"They	1
might	1
call	1
a	1
halt	1
here	1
or	1
we'll	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
another	1
four	1
miles	1
without	1
eating."	1
	1
"Wasn't	1
it	1
fine	1
when	1
those	1
Germans	1
gave	1
us	1
lifts!	1
You	1
just	1
sit	1
still	1
and	1
are	1
drawn	1
along."	1
	1
"And	1
here,	1
friend,	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
quite	1
beggarly.	1
There	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
Poles--all	1
under	1
the	1
Russian	1
crown--but	1
here	1
they're	1
all	1
regular	1
Germans."	1
	1
"Singers	1
to	1
the	1
front"	1
came	1
the	1
captain's	1
order.	1
	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
different	1
ranks	1
some	1
twenty	1
men	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
front.	1
A	1
drummer,	1
their	1
leader,	1
turned	1
round	1
facing	1
the	1
singers,	1
and	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm,	1
began	1
a	1
long-drawn-out	1
soldiers'	1
song,	1
commencing	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Morning	1
dawned,	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
rising,"	1
and	1
concluding:	1
"On	1
then,	1
brothers,	1
on	1
to	1
glory,	1
led	1
by	1
Father	1
Kamenski."	1
This	1
song	1
had	1
been	1
composed	1
in	1
the	1
Turkish	1
campaign	1
and	1
now	1
being	1
sung	1
in	1
Austria,	1
the	1
only	1
change	1
being	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
"Father	1
Kamenski"	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
"Father	1
Kutuzov."	1
	1
Having	1
jerked	1
out	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
as	1
soldiers	1
do	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
flinging	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
the	1
drummer--a	1
lean,	1
handsome	1
soldier	1
of	1
forty--looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
the	1
singers	1
and	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
having	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
that	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
both	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
carefully	1
lifting	1
some	1
invisible	1
but	1
precious	1
object	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
and,	1
holding	1
it	1
there	1
for	1
some	1
seconds,	1
suddenly	1
flung	1
it	1
down	1
and	1
began:	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
bower,	1
oh,	1
my	1
bower...!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
bower	1
new...!"	1
chimed	1
in	1
twenty	1
voices,	1
and	1
the	1
castanet	1
player,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
his	1
equipment,	1
rushed	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
and,	1
walking	1
backwards	1
before	1
the	1
company,	1
jerked	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
flourished	1
his	1
castanets	1
as	1
if	1
threatening	1
someone.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
swinging	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
keeping	1
time	1
spontaneously,	1
marched	1
with	1
long	1
steps.	1
Behind	1
the	1
company	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels,	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
springs,	1
and	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
were	1
heard.	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
his	1
suite	1
were	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
town.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
continue	1
to	1
march	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
suite	1
showed	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
singing	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
dancing	1
soldier	1
and	1
the	1
gay	1
and	1
smartly	1
marching	1
men.	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
file	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
flank,	1
beside	1
which	1
the	1
carriage	1
passed	1
the	1
company,	1
a	1
blue-	1
eyed	1
soldier	1
involuntarily	1
attracted	1
notice.	1
It	1
was	1
Dolokhov	1
marching	1
with	1
particular	1
grace	1
and	1
boldness	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
song	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
those	1
driving	1
past	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
pitied	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
marching	1
with	1
the	1
company.	1
The	1
hussar	1
cornet	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
suite	1
who	1
had	1
mimicked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
fell	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
Hussar	1
cornet	1
Zherkov	1
had	1
at	1
one	1
time,	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
set	1
led	1
by	1
Dolokhov.	1
Zherkov	1
had	1
met	1
Dolokhov	1
abroad	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
fit	1
to	1
recognize	1
him.	1
But	1
now	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
ranker,	1
he	1
addressed	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
cordiality	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
said	1
he	1
through	1
the	1
singing,	1
making	1
his	1
horse	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
the	1
company.	1
	1
"How	1
am	1
I?"	1
Dolokhov	1
answered	1
coldly.	1
"I	1
am	1
as	1
you	1
see."	1
	1
The	1
lively	1
song	1
gave	1
a	1
special	1
flavor	1
to	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
gaiety	1
with	1
which	1
Zherkov	1
spoke,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
intentional	1
coldness	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
reply.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
officers?"	1
inquired	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"All	1
right.	1
They	1
are	1
good	1
fellows.	1
And	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
wriggled	1
onto	1
the	1
staff?"	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
attached;	1
I'm	1
on	1
duty."	1
	1
Both	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"She	1
let	1
the	1
hawk	1
fly	1
upward	1
from	1
her	1
wide	1
right	1
sleeve,"	1
went	1
the	1
song,	1
arousing	1
an	1
involuntary	1
sensation	1
of	1
courage	1
and	1
cheerfulness.	1
Their	1
conversation	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
different	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
that	1
song.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
Austrians	1
have	1
been	1
beaten?"	1
asked	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"The	1
devil	1
only	1
knows!	1
They	1
say	1
so."	1
	1
"I'm	1
glad,"	1
answered	1
Dolokhov	1
briefly	1
and	1
clearly,	1
as	1
the	1
song	1
demanded.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
come	1
round	1
some	1
evening	1
and	1
we'll	1
have	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
faro!"	1
said	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"Why,	1
have	1
you	1
too	1
much	1
money?"	1
	1
"Do	1
come."	1
	1
"I	1
can't.	1
I've	1
sworn	1
not	1
to.	1
I	1
won't	1
drink	1
and	1
won't	1
play	1
till	1
I	1
get	1
reinstated."	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
only	1
till	1
the	1
first	1
engagement."	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
see."	1
	1
They	1
were	1
again	1
silent.	1
	1
"Come	1
if	1
you	1
need	1
anything.	1
One	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
on	1
the	1
staff..."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
smiled.	1
"Don't	1
trouble.	1
If	1
I	1
want	1
anything,	1
I	1
won't	1
beg--I'll	1
take	1
it!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
never	1
mind;	1
I	1
only..."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
only..."	1
	1
"Good-bye."	1
	1
"Good	1
health..."	1
	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
long,	1
long	1
way.	1
To	1
my	1
native	1
land..."	1
	1
Zherkov	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
spurs;	1
it	1
pranced	1
excitedly	1
from	1
foot	1
to	1
foot	1
uncertain	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
start,	1
then	1
settled	1
down,	1
galloped	1
past	1
the	1
company,	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
carriage,	1
still	1
keeping	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
song.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
On	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
review,	1
Kutuzov	1
took	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
into	1
his	1
private	1
room	1
and,	1
calling	1
his	1
adjutant,	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
papers	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
on	1
their	1
arrival,	1
and	1
the	1
letters	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
advanced	1
army.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
required	1
papers.	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
a	1
plan	1
was	1
spread	1
out.	1
	1
"Ah!..."	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
glancing	1
at	1
Bolkonski	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
this	1
exclamation	1
he	1
was	1
asking	1
the	1
adjutant	1
to	1
wait,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"All	1
I	1
can	1
say,	1
General,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
elegance	1
of	1
expression	1
and	1
intonation	1
that	1
obliged	1
one	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
each	1
deliberately	1
spoken	1
word.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
listened	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
voice.	1
"All	1
I	1
can	1
say,	1
General,	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
matter	1
depended	1
on	1
my	1
personal	1
wishes,	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
long	1
ago.	1
I	1
should	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
joined	1
the	1
archduke.	1
And	1
believe	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
honour	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
personally	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
supreme	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
informed	1
and	1
more	1
skillful	1
general--of	1
whom	1
Austria	1
has	1
so	1
many--and	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
all	1
this	1
heavy	1
responsibility.	1
But	1
circumstances	1
are	1
sometimes	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
us,	1
General."	1
	1
And	1
Kutuzov	1
smiled	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"You	1
are	1
quite	1
at	1
liberty	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
even	1
care	1
whether	1
you	1
do	1
or	1
not,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
grounds	1
for	1
telling	1
me	1
so.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
point."	1
	1
The	1
Austrian	1
general	1
looked	1
dissatisfied,	1
but	1
had	1
no	1
option	1
but	1
to	1
reply	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
querulous	1
and	1
angry	1
tone	1
that	1
contrasted	1
with	1
his	1
flattering	1
words,	1
"on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
your	1
excellency's	1
participation	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
action	1
is	1
highly	1
valued	1
by	1
His	1
Majesty;	1
but	1
we	1
think	1
the	1
present	1
delay	1
is	1
depriving	1
the	1
splendid	1
Russian	1
troops	1
and	1
their	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
laurels	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
win	1
in	1
their	1
battles,"	1
he	1
concluded	1
his	1
evidently	1
prearranged	1
sentence.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
bowed	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile.	1
	1
"But	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
conviction,	1
and	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
with	1
which	1
His	1
Highness	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
has	1
honored	1
me,	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
Austrian	1
troops,	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
so	1
skillful	1
a	1
leader	1
as	1
General	1
Mack,	1
have	1
by	1
now	1
already	1
gained	1
a	1
decisive	1
victory	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
need	1
our	1
aid,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
frowned.	1
Though	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
definite	1
news	1
of	1
an	1
Austrian	1
defeat,	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
circumstances	1
confirming	1
the	1
unfavorable	1
rumors	1
that	1
were	1
afloat,	1
and	1
so	1
Kutuzov's	1
suggestion	1
of	1
an	1
Austrian	1
victory	1
sounded	1
much	1
like	1
irony.	1
But	1
Kutuzov	1
went	1
on	1
blandly	1
smiling	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
suppose	1
so.	1
And,	1
in	1
fact,	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
Mack's	1
army	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
and	1
stated	1
strategically	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
very	1
favorable.	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
that	1
letter,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Please	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
it"--and	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
an	1
ironical	1
smile	1
about	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
read	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
the	1
following	1
passage,	1
in	1
German,	1
from	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand's	1
letter:	1
	1
We	1
have	1
fully	1
concentrated	1
forces	1
of	1
nearly	1
seventy	1
thousand	1
men	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
defeat	1
the	1
enemy	1
should	1
he	1
cross	1
the	1
Lech.	1
Also,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
masters	1
of	1
Ulm,	1
we	1
cannot	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
commanding	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
Danube,	1
so	1
that	1
should	1
the	1
enemy	1
not	1
cross	1
the	1
Lech,	1
we	1
can	1
cross	1
the	1
Danube,	1
throw	1
ourselves	1
on	1
his	1
line	1
of	1
communications,	1
recross	1
the	1
river	1
lower	1
down,	1
and	1
frustrate	1
his	1
intention	1
should	1
he	1
try	1
to	1
direct	1
his	1
whole	1
force	1
against	1
our	1
faithful	1
ally.	1
We	1
shall	1
therefore	1
confidently	1
await	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
Imperial	1
Russian	1
army	1
will	1
be	1
fully	1
equipped,	1
and	1
shall	1
then,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
it,	1
easily	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
the	1
enemy	1
the	1
fate	1
he	1
deserves.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
on	1
finishing	1
this	1
paragraph	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
mildly	1
and	1
attentively.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
wise	1
maxim	1
your	1
excellency,	1
advising	1
one	1
to	1
expect	1
the	1
worst,"	1
said	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
jests	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
business.	1
He	1
involuntarily	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
aide-de-camp.	1
	1
"Excuse	1
me,	1
General,"	1
interrupted	1
Kutuzov,	1
also	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Look	1
here,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
get	1
from	1
Kozlovski	1
all	1
the	1
reports	1
from	1
our	1
scouts.	1
Here	1
are	1
two	1
letters	1
from	1
Count	1
Nostitz	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
one	1
from	1
His	1
Highness	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
these,"	1
he	1
said,	1
handing	1
him	1
several	1
papers,	1
"make	1
a	1
neat	1
memorandum	1
in	1
French	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
showing	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army,	1
and	1
then	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
excellency."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
having	1
understood	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
not	1
only	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
but	1
also	1
what	1
Kutuzov	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
He	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
both,	1
stepped	1
softly	1
over	1
the	1
carpet	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
room.	1
	1
Though	1
not	1
much	1
time	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
left	1
Russia,	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
greatly	1
during	1
that	1
period.	1
In	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
in	1
his	1
movements,	1
in	1
his	1
walk,	1
scarcely	1
a	1
trace	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
affected	1
languor	1
and	1
indolence.	1
He	1
now	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
he	1
makes	1
on	1
others,	1
but	1
is	1
occupied	1
with	1
agreeable	1
and	1
interesting	1
work.	1
His	1
face	1
expressed	1
more	1
satisfaction	1
with	1
himself	1
and	1
those	1
around	1
him,	1
his	1
smile	1
and	1
glance	1
were	1
brighter	1
and	1
more	1
attractive.	1
	1
Kutuzov,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
overtaken	1
in	1
Poland,	1
had	1
received	1
him	1
very	1
kindly,	1
promised	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
him,	1
distinguished	1
him	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
adjutants,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
to	1
Vienna	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
more	1
serious	1
commissions.	1
From	1
Vienna	1
Kutuzov	1
wrote	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
comrade,	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
father.	1
	1
Your	1
son	1
bids	1
fair	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
officer	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
industry,	1
firmness,	1
and	1
expedition.	1
I	1
consider	1
myself	1
fortunate	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
subordinate	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
On	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff,	1
among	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
generally,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society,	1
two	1
quite	1
opposite	1
reputations.	1
Some,	1
a	1
minority,	1
acknowledged	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
different	1
from	1
themselves	1
and	1
from	1
everyone	1
else,	1
expected	1
great	1
things	1
of	1
him,	1
listened	1
to	1
him,	1
admired,	1
and	1
imitated	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
natural	1
and	1
pleasant.	1
Others,	1
the	1
majority,	1
disliked	1
him	1
and	1
considered	1
him	1
conceited,	1
cold,	1
and	1
disagreeable.	1
But	1
among	1
these	1
people	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
stand	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
respected	1
and	1
even	1
feared	1
him.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
room	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
papers	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
comrade,	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
on	1
duty,	1
Kozlovski,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
with	1
a	1
book.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Prince?"	1
asked	1
Kozlovski.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
ordered	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
memorandum	1
explaining	1
why	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
advancing."	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"Any	1
news	1
from	1
Mack?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
beaten,	1
news	1
would	1
have	1
come."	1
	1
"Probably,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
outer	1
door.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
a	1
tall	1
Austrian	1
general	1
in	1
a	1
greatcoat,	1
with	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Maria	1
Theresa	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
bandage	1
round	1
his	1
head,	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
just	1
arrived,	1
entered	1
quickly,	1
slamming	1
the	1
door.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped	1
short.	1
	1
"Commander	1
in	1
Chief	1
Kutuzov?"	1
said	1
the	1
newly	1
arrived	1
general	1
speaking	1
quickly	1
with	1
a	1
harsh	1
German	1
accent,	1
looking	1
to	1
both	1
sides	1
and	1
advancing	1
straight	1
toward	1
the	1
inner	1
door.	1
	1
"The	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
engaged,"	1
said	1
Kozlovski,	1
going	1
hurriedly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
unknown	1
general	1
and	1
blocking	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
"Whom	1
shall	1
I	1
announce?"	1
	1
The	1
unknown	1
general	1
looked	1
disdainfully	1
down	1
at	1
Kozlovski,	1
who	1
was	1
rather	1
short,	1
as	1
if	1
surprised	1
that	1
anyone	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
engaged,"	1
repeated	1
Kozlovski	1
calmly.	1
	1
The	1
general's	1
face	1
clouded,	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
and	1
trembled.	1
He	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
notebook,	1
hurriedly	1
scribbled	1
something	1
in	1
pencil,	1
tore	1
out	1
the	1
leaf,	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Kozlovski,	1
stepped	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
chair,	1
gazing	1
at	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
if	1
asking,	1
"Why	1
do	1
they	1
look	1
at	1
me?"	1
Then	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
head,	1
stretched	1
his	1
neck	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
immediately,	1
with	1
affected	1
indifference,	1
began	1
to	1
hum	1
to	1
himself,	1
producing	1
a	1
queer	1
sound	1
which	1
immediately	1
broke	1
off.	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
private	1
room	1
opened	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway.	1
The	1
general	1
with	1
the	1
bandaged	1
head	1
bent	1
forward	1
as	1
though	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
some	1
danger,	1
and,	1
making	1
long,	1
quick	1
strides	1
with	1
his	1
thin	1
legs,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"Vous	1
voyez	1
le	1
malheureux	1
Mack,"	1
he	1
uttered	1
in	1
a	1
broken	1
voice.	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
doorway	1
remained	1
perfectly	1
immobile	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments.	1
Then	1
wrinkles	1
ran	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
wave	1
and	1
his	1
forehead	1
became	1
smooth	1
again,	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
respectfully,	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
silently	1
let	1
Mack	1
enter	1
his	1
room	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
himself	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
report	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
circulated	1
that	1
the	1
Austrians	1
had	1
been	1
beaten	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
had	1
surrendered	1
at	1
Ulm	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
correct.	1
Within	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
adjutants	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
in	1
various	1
directions	1
with	1
orders	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
who	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
inactive,	1
would	1
also	1
soon	1
have	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
staff	1
officers	1
whose	1
chief	1
interest	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
war.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
Mack	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
disaster	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
half	1
the	1
campaign	1
was	1
lost,	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army's	1
position,	1
and	1
vividly	1
imagined	1
what	1
awaited	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
play.	1
Involuntarily	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
joyful	1
agitation	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
humiliation	1
of	1
arrogant	1
Austria	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
week's	1
time	1
he	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
see	1
and	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
Russian	1
encounter	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
since	1
Suvorov	1
met	1
them.	1
He	1
feared	1
that	1
Bonaparte's	1
genius	1
might	1
outweigh	1
all	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
hero	1
being	1
disgraced.	1
	1
Excited	1
and	1
irritated	1
by	1
these	1
thoughts	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
toward	1
his	1
room	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
wrote	1
every	1
day.	1
In	1
the	1
corridor	1
he	1
met	1
Nesvitski,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
shared	1
a	1
room,	1
and	1
the	1
wag	1
Zherkov;	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
usual	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
glum?"	1
asked	1
Nesvitski	1
noticing	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
gay	1
about,"	1
answered	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
met	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
Zherkov,	1
there	1
came	1
toward	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
corridor,	1
Strauch,	1
an	1
Austrian	1
general	1
who	1
on	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
provisioning	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
and	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
who	1
had	1
arrived	1
the	1
previous	1
evening.	1
There	1
was	1
room	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
corridor	1
for	1
the	1
generals	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
three	1
officers	1
quite	1
easily,	1
but	1
Zherkov,	1
pushing	1
Nesvitski	1
aside	1
with	1
his	1
arm,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
breathless	1
voice,	1
	1
"They're	1
coming!...	1
they're	1
coming!...	1
Stand	1
aside,	1
make	1
way,	1
please	1
make	1
way!"	1
	1
The	1
generals	1
were	1
passing	1
by,	1
looking	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
embarrassing	1
attentions.	1
On	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
wag	1
Zherkov	1
there	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
a	1
stupid	1
smile	1
of	1
glee	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
unable	1
to	1
suppress.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
German,	1
stepping	1
forward	1
and	1
addressing	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
congratulate	1
you."	1
	1
He	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
scraped	1
first	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
awkwardly,	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
at	1
a	1
dancing	1
lesson.	1
	1
The	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
severely	1
but,	1
seeing	1
the	1
seriousness	1
of	1
his	1
stupid	1
smile,	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
moment's	1
attention.	1
He	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
showing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
listening.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
congratulate	1
you.	1
General	1
Mack	1
has	1
arrived,	1
quite	1
well,	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
bruised	1
just	1
here,"	1
he	1
added,	1
pointing	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
smile	1
to	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
frowned,	1
turned	1
away,	1
and	1
went	1
on.	1
	1
"Gott,	1
wie	1
naiv!"	1
*	1
said	1
he	1
angrily,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
few	1
steps.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Good	1
God,	1
what	1
simplicity!"	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
threw	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
but	1
Bolkonski,	1
turning	1
still	1
paler,	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Zherkov.	1
The	1
nervous	1
irritation	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
Mack,	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
defeat,	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
found	1
vent	1
in	1
anger	1
at	1
Zherkov's	1
untimely	1
jest.	1
	1
"If	1
you,	1
sir,	1
choose	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
buffoon	1
of	1
yourself,"	1
he	1
said	1
sharply,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
trembling	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw,	1
"I	1
can't	1
prevent	1
your	1
doing	1
so;	1
but	1
I	1
warn	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
fool	1
in	1
my	1
presence,	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
behave	1
yourself."	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
Zherkov	1
were	1
so	1
surprised	1
by	1
this	1
outburst	1
that	1
they	1
gazed	1
at	1
Bolkonski	1
silently	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?	1
I	1
only	1
congratulated	1
them,"	1
said	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
jesting	1
with	1
you;	1
please	1
be	1
silent!"	1
cried	1
Bolkonski,	1
and	1
taking	1
Nesvitski's	1
arm	1
he	1
left	1
Zherkov,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Come,	1
what's	1
the	1
matter,	1
old	1
fellow?"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
trying	1
to	1
soothe	1
him.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
exclaimed	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
standing	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
excitement.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
either	1
we	1
are	1
officers	1
serving	1
our	1
Tsar	1
and	1
our	1
country,	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
successes	1
and	1
grieving	1
at	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
our	1
common	1
cause,	1
or	1
we	1
are	1
merely	1
lackeys	1
who	1
care	1
nothing	1
for	1
their	1
master's	1
business.	1
Quarante	1

et	1

*	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
strengthening	1
his	1
views	1
by	1
this	1
French	1
sentence.	1
"C'est	1
bien	1
pour	1
un	1
garcon	1
de	1
rien	1
comme	1
cet	1
individu	1
dont	1
vous	1

pour	1
vous.	1
*(2)	1
Only	1
a	1
hobbledehoy	1
could	1
amuse	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
way,"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
Russian--but	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
accent--having	1
noticed	1
that	1
Zherkov	1
could	1
still	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Forty	1
thousand	1
men	1
massacred	1
and	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
our	1
allies	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
you	1
find	1
that	1
a	1
cause	1
for	1
jesting!"	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"It	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
that	1
good-for-nothing	1
fellow	1
of	1
whom	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
friend,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
you,	1
not	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
He	1
waited	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
cornet	1
would	1
answer,	1
but	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
corridor.	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
The	1
Pavlograd	1
Hussars	1
were	1
stationed	1
two	1
miles	1
from	1
Braunau.	1
The	1
squadron	1
in	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
served	1
as	1
a	1
cadet	1
was	1
quartered	1
in	1
the	1
German	1
village	1
of	1
Salzeneck.	1
The	1
best	1
quarters	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
were	1
assigned	1
to	1
cavalry-captain	1
Denisov,	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
known	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
cavalry	1
division	1
as	1
Vaska	1
Denisov.	1
Cadet	1
Rostov,	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
overtaken	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
Poland,	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander.	1
	1
On	1
October	1
11,	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
astir	1
at	1
headquarters	1
over	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
Mack's	1
defeat,	1
the	1
camp	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
this	1
squadron	1
was	1
proceeding	1
as	1
usual.	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
losing	1
at	1
cards	1
all	1
night,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
home	1
when	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
back	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
from	1
a	1
foraging	1
expedition.	1
Rostov	1
in	1
his	1
cadet	1
uniform,	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
to	1
his	1
horse,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch,	1
swung	1
his	1
leg	1
over	1
the	1
saddle	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
youthful	1
movement,	1
stood	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
stirrup	1
as	1
if	1
loathe	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
sprang	1
down	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
orderly.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Bondarenko,	1
dear	1
friend!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
hussar	1
who	1
rushed	1
up	1
headlong	1
to	1
the	1
horse.	1
"Walk	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
with	1
that	1
gay	1
brotherly	1
cordiality	1
which	1
goodhearted	1
young	1
people	1
show	1
to	1
everyone	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
happy.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Ukrainian	1
gaily,	1
tossing	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Mind,	1
walk	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
well!"	1
	1
Another	1
hussar	1
also	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
horse,	1
but	1
Bondarenko	1
had	1
already	1
thrown	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
the	1
snaffle	1
bridle	1
over	1
the	1
horse's	1
head.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
cadet	1
was	1
liberal	1
with	1
his	1
tips	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
paid	1
to	1
serve	1
him.	1
Rostov	1
patted	1
the	1
horse's	1
neck	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
flank,	1
and	1
lingered	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
"Splendid!	1
What	1
a	1
horse	1
he	1
will	1
be!"	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
saber,	1
his	1
spurs	1
jingling,	1
he	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
porch.	1
His	1
landlord,	1
who	1
in	1
a	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
a	1
pointed	1
cap,	1
pitchfork	1
in	1
hand,	1
was	1
clearing	1
manure	1
from	1
the	1
cowhouse,	1
looked	1
out,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
immediately	1
brightened	1
on	1
seeing	1
Rostov.	1
"Schon	1
gut	1
Morgen!	1
Schon	1
gut	1
Morgen!"	1
*	1
he	1
said	1
winking	1
with	1
a	1
merry	1
smile,	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
to	1
greet	1
the	1
young	1
man.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"A	1
very	1
good	1
morning!	1
A	1
very	1
good	1
morning!"	1
	1
"Schon	1
fleissig?"	1
*	1
said	1
Rostov	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
gay	1
brotherly	1
smile	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
his	1
eager	1
face.	1
"Hoch	1
Oestreicher!	1
Hoch	1
Russen!	1
Kaiser	1
Alexander	1
hoch!"	1
*(2)	1
said	1
he,	1
quoting	1
words	1
often	1
repeated	1
by	1
the	1
German	1
landlord.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Busy	1
already?"	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"Hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
Austrians!	1
Hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
Russians!	1
Hurrah	1
for	1
Emperor	1
Alexander!"	1
	1
The	1
German	1
laughed,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cowshed,	1
pulled	1
off	1
his	1
cap,	1
and	1
waving	1
it	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
cried:	1
	1
"Und	1
die	1
ganze	1
Welt	1
hoch!"	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"And	1
hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
world!"	1
	1
Rostov	1
waved	1
his	1
cap	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
the	1
German	1
and	1
cried	1
laughing,	1
"Und	1
vivat	1
die	1
ganze	1
Welt!"	1
Though	1
neither	1
the	1
German	1
cleaning	1
his	1
cowshed	1
nor	1
Rostov	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
platoon	1
from	1
foraging	1
for	1
hay	1
had	1
any	1
reason	1
for	1
rejoicing,	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
joyful	1
delight	1
and	1
brotherly	1
love,	1
wagged	1
their	1
heads	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
their	1
mutual	1
affection,	1
and	1
parted	1
smiling,	1
the	1
German	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
cowshed	1
and	1
Rostov	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
he	1
occupied	1
with	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"What	1
about	1
your	1
master?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Lavrushka,	1
Denisov's	1
orderly,	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
regiment	1
knew	1
for	1
a	1
rogue.	1
	1
"Hasn't	1
been	1
in	1
since	1
the	1
evening.	1
Must	1
have	1
been	1
losing,"	1
answered	1
Lavrushka.	1
"I	1
know	1
by	1
now,	1
if	1
he	1
wins	1
he	1
comes	1
back	1
early	1
to	1
brag	1
about	1
it,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
stays	1
out	1
till	1
morning	1
it	1
means	1
he's	1
lost	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
rage.	1
Will	1
you	1
have	1
coffee?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
bring	1
some."	1
	1
Ten	1
minutes	1
later	1
Lavrushka	1
brought	1
the	1
coffee.	1
"He's	1
coming!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Now	1
for	1
trouble!"	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
saw	1
Denisov	1
coming	1
home.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face,	1
sparkling	1
black	1
eyes,	1
and	1
black	1
tousled	1
mustache	1
and	1
hair.	1
He	1
wore	1
an	1
unfastened	1
cloak,	1
wide	1
breeches	1
hanging	1
down	1
in	1
creases,	1
and	1
a	1
crumpled	1
shako	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
gloomily,	1
hanging	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Lavwuska!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
loudly	1
and	1
angrily,	1
"take	1
it	1
off,	1
blockhead!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
am	1
taking	1
it	1
off,"	1
replied	1
Lavrushka's	1
voice.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you're	1
up	1
already,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
entering	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Long	1
ago,"	1
answered	1
Rostov,	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
hay,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
Fraulein	1
Mathilde."	1
	1
"Weally!	1
And	1
I've	1
been	1
losing,	1
bwother.	1
I	1
lost	1
yesterday	1
like	1
a	1
damned	1
fool!"	1
cried	1
Denisov,	1
not	1
pronouncing	1
his	1
r's.	1
"Such	1
ill	1
luck!	1
Such	1
ill	1
luck.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
left,	1
it	1
began	1
and	1
went	1
on.	1
Hullo	1
there!	1
Tea!"	1
	1
Puckering	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
though	1
smiling,	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
short	1
strong	1
teeth,	1
he	1
began	1
with	1
stubby	1
fingers	1
of	1
both	1
hands	1
to	1
ruffle	1
up	1
his	1
thick	1
tangled	1
black	1
hair.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
devil	1
made	1
me	1
go	1
to	1
that	1
wat?"	1
(an	1
officer	1
nicknamed	1
"the	1
rat")	1
he	1
said,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
whole	1
face	1
with	1
both	1
hands.	1
"Just	1
fancy,	1
he	1
didn't	1
let	1
me	1
win	1
a	1
single	1
cahd,	1
not	1
one	1
cahd."	1
	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
lighted	1
pipe	1
that	1
was	1
offered	1
to	1
him,	1
gripped	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
fist,	1
and	1
tapped	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
making	1
the	1
sparks	1
fly,	1
while	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
shout.	1
	1
"He	1
lets	1
one	1
win	1
the	1
singles	1
and	1
collahs	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
one	1
doubles	1
it;	1
gives	1
the	1
singles	1
and	1
snatches	1
the	1
doubles!"	1
	1
He	1
scattered	1
the	1
burning	1
tobacco,	1
smashed	1
the	1
pipe,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
away.	1
Then	1
he	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
looked	1
cheerfully	1
with	1
his	1
glittering,	1
black	1
eyes	1
at	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"If	1
at	1
least	1
we	1
had	1
some	1
women	1
here;	1
but	1
there's	1
nothing	1
foh	1
one	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
dwink.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
to	1
fighting	1
soon.	1
Hullo,	1
who's	1
there?"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
tread	1
of	1
heavy	1
boots	1
and	1
the	1
clinking	1
of	1
spurs	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop,	1
and	1
a	1
respectful	1
cough.	1
	1
"The	1
squadron	1
quartermaster!"	1
said	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
Denisov's	1
face	1
puckered	1
still	1
more.	1
	1
"Wetched!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
throwing	1
down	1
a	1
purse	1
with	1
some	1
gold	1
in	1
it.	1
"Wostov,	1
deah	1
fellow,	1
just	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
there	1
is	1
left	1
and	1
shove	1
the	1
purse	1
undah	1
the	1
pillow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
quartermaster.	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
money	1
and,	1
mechanically	1
arranging	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
new	1
coins	1
in	1
separate	1
piles,	1
began	1
counting	1
them.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
Telyanin!	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do?	1
They	1
plucked	1
me	1
last	1
night,"	1
came	1
Denisov's	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
	1
"Where?	1
At	1
Bykov's,	1
at	1
the	1
rat's...	1
I	1
knew	1
it,"	1
replied	1
a	1
piping	1
voice,	1
and	1
Lieutenant	1
Telyanin,	1
a	1
small	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
squadron,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Rostov	1
thrust	1
the	1
purse	1
under	1
the	1
pillow	1
and	1
shook	1
the	1
damp	1
little	1
hand	1
which	1
was	1
offered	1
him.	1
Telyanin	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
had	1
been	1
transferred	1
from	1
the	1
Guards	1
just	1
before	1
this	1
campaign.	1
He	1
behaved	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
liked;	1
Rostov	1
especially	1
detested	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
overcome	1
or	1
conceal	1
his	1
groundless	1
antipathy	1
to	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
"Well,	1
young	1
cavalryman,	1
how	1
is	1
my	1
Rook	1
behaving?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
(Rook	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
horse	1
Telyanin	1
had	1
sold	1
to	1
Rostov.)	1
	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
never	1
looked	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face;	1
his	1
eyes	1
continually	1
wandered	1
from	1
one	1
object	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
you	1
riding	1
this	1
morning..."	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he's	1
all	1
right,	1
a	1
good	1
horse,"	1
answered	1
Rostov,	1
though	1
the	1
horse	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
paid	1
seven	1
hundred	1
rubbles	1
was	1
not	1
worth	1
half	1
that	1
sum.	1
"He's	1
begun	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
little	1
lame	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
foreleg,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"The	1
hoof's	1
cracked!	1
That's	1
nothing.	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
show	1
you	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
rivet	1
to	1
use."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
please	1
do,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"I'll	1
show	1
you,	1
I'll	1
show	1
you!	1
It's	1
not	1
a	1
secret.	1
And	1
it's	1
a	1
horse	1
you'll	1
thank	1
me	1
for."	1
	1
"Then	1
I'll	1
have	1
it	1
brought	1
round,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
wishing	1
to	1
avoid	1
Telyanin,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
order.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
passage	1
Denisov,	1
with	1
a	1
pipe,	1
was	1
squatting	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
facing	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
who	1
was	1
reporting	1
to	1
him.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Rostov,	1
Denisov	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
pointing	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
with	1
his	1
thumb	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Telyanin	1
was	1
sitting,	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
shudder	1
of	1
disgust.	1
	1
"Ugh!	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
that	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
quartermaster's	1
presence.	1
	1
Rostov	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say:	1
"Nor	1
do	1
I,	1
but	1
what's	1
one	1
to	1
do?"	1
and,	1
having	1
given	1
his	1
order,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
Telyanin	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
indolent	1
pose	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
had	1
left	1
him,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hands.	1
	1
"Well	1
there	1
certainly	1
are	1
disgusting	1
people,"	1
thought	1
Rostov	1
as	1
he	1
entered.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
horse?"	1
asked	1
Telyanin,	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
looking	1
carelessly	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
have."	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
ourselves.	1
I	1
only	1
came	1
round	1
to	1
ask	1
Denisov	1
about	1
yesterday's	1
order.	1
Have	1
you	1
got	1
it,	1
Denisov?"	1
	1
"Not	1
yet.	1
But	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?"	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
teach	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
how	1
to	1
shoe	1
a	1
horse,"	1
said	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
They	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
stable.	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
explained	1
how	1
to	1
rivet	1
the	1
hoof	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
quarters.	1
	1
When	1
Rostov	1
went	1
back	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
vodka	1
and	1
a	1
sausage	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
sitting	1
there	1
scratching	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
on	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper.	1
He	1
looked	1
gloomily	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
face	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
am	1
witing	1
to	1
her."	1
	1
He	1
leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and,	1
evidently	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
say	1
quicker	1
in	1
words	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
write,	1
told	1
Rostov	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
his	1
letter.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
my	1
fwiend,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"we	1
sleep	1
when	1
we	1
don't	1
love.	1
We	1
are	1
childwen	1
of	1
the	1
dust...	1
but	1
one	1
falls	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
a	1
God,	1
one	1
is	1
pua'	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
cweation...	1
Who's	1
that	1
now?	1
Send	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
devil,	1
I'm	1
busy!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
Lavrushka,	1
who	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
abashed.	1
	1
"Who	1
should	1
it	1
be?	1
You	1
yourself	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
come.	1
It's	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
for	1
the	1
money."	1
	1
Denisov	1
frowned	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
shout	1
some	1
reply	1
but	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Wetched	1
business,"	1
he	1
muttered	1
to	1
himself.	1
"How	1
much	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
puhse?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Seven	1
new	1
and	1
three	1
old	1
imperials."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
wetched!	1
Well,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
standing	1
there	1
for,	1
you	1
sca'cwow?	1
Call	1
the	1
quahtehmasteh,"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"Please,	1
Denisov,	1
let	1
me	1
lend	1
you	1
some:	1
I	1
have	1
some,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
blushing.	1
	1
"Don't	1
like	1
bowwowing	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
fellows,	1
I	1
don't,"	1
growled	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
you	1
won't	1
accept	1
money	1
from	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
comrade,	1
you	1
will	1
offend	1
me.	1
Really	1
I	1
have	1
some,"	1
Rostov	1
repeated.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
tell	1
you."	1
	1
And	1
Denisov	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
purse	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
"Where	1
have	1
you	1
put	1
it,	1
Wostov?"	1
	1
"Under	1
the	1
lower	1
pillow."	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
there."	1
	1
Denisov	1
threw	1
both	1
pillows	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
The	1
purse	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
miwacle."	1
	1
"Wait,	1
haven't	1
you	1
dropped	1
it?"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
picking	1
up	1
the	1
pillows	1
one	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
shaking	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
pulled	1
off	1
the	1
quilt	1
and	1
shook	1
it.	1
The	1
purse	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
	1
"Dear	1
me,	1
can	1
I	1
have	1
forgotten?	1
No,	1
I	1
remember	1
thinking	1
that	1
you	1
kept	1
it	1
under	1
your	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
treasure,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"I	1
put	1
it	1
just	1
here.	1
Where	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"I	1
haven't	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
where	1
you	1
put	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
isn't?..."	1
	1
"You're	1
always	1
like	1
that;	1
you	1
thwow	1
a	1
thing	1
down	1
anywhere	1
and	1
forget	1
it.	1
Feel	1
in	1
your	1
pockets."	1
	1
"No,	1
if	1
I	1
hadn't	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
being	1
a	1
treasure,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
"but	1
I	1
remember	1
putting	1
it	1
there."	1
	1
Lavrushka	1
turned	1
all	1
the	1
bedding	1
over,	1
looked	1
under	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
table,	1
searched	1
everywhere,	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Denisov	1
silently	1
watched	1
Lavrushka's	1
movements,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
threw	1
up	1
his	1
arms	1
in	1
surprise	1
saying	1
it	1
was	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
Denisov	1
glanced	1
at	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Wostov,	1
you've	1
not	1
been	1
playing	1
schoolboy	1
twicks..."	1
	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
Denisov's	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
instantly	1
dropped	1
them	1
again.	1
All	1
the	1
blood	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
congested	1
somewhere	1
below	1
his	1
throat	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
eyes.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
draw	1
breath.	1
	1
"And	1
there	1
hasn't	1
been	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
except	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
and	1
yourselves.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
here	1
somewhere,"	1
said	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
you	1
devil's	1
puppet,	1
look	1
alive	1
and	1
hunt	1
for	1
it!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
suddenly,	1
turning	1
purple	1
and	1
rushing	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
threatening	1
gesture.	1
"If	1
the	1
purse	1
isn't	1
found	1
I'll	1
flog	1
you,	1
I'll	1
flog	1
you	1
all."	1
	1
Rostov,	1
his	1
eyes	1
avoiding	1
Denisov,	1
began	1
buttoning	1
his	1
coat,	1
buckled	1
on	1
his	1
saber,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
have	1
that	1
purse,	1
I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
shaking	1
his	1
orderly	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders	1
and	1
knocking	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
"Denisov,	1
let	1
him	1
alone,	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
going	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Denisov	1
paused,	1
thought	1
a	1
moment,	1
and,	1
evidently	1
understanding	1
what	1
Rostov	1
hinted	1
at,	1
seized	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"Nonsense!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
the	1
veins	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
neck	1
stood	1
out	1
like	1
cords.	1
"You	1
are	1
mad,	1
I	1
tell	1
you.	1
I	1
won't	1
allow	1
it.	1
The	1
purse	1
is	1
here!	1
I'll	1
flay	1
this	1
scoundwel	1
alive,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it,"	1
repeated	1
Rostov	1
in	1
an	1
unsteady	1
voice,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
don't	1
you	1
dahe	1
to	1
do	1
it!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
rushing	1
at	1
the	1
cadet	1
to	1
restrain	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
Rostov	1
pulled	1
away	1
his	1
arm	1
and,	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
anger	1
as	1
though	1
Denisov	1
were	1
his	1
worst	1
enemy,	1
firmly	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
directly	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
understand	1
what	1
you're	1
saying?"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice.	1
"There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
except	1
myself.	1
So	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
then..."	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
finish,	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
may	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
you	1
and	1
evewybody,"	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
Rostov	1
heard.	1
	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
Telyanin's	1
quarters.	1
	1
"The	1
master	1
is	1
not	1
in,	1
he's	1
gone	1
to	1
headquarters,"	1
said	1
Telyanin's	1
orderly.	1
"Has	1
something	1
happened?"	1
he	1
added,	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
cadet's	1
troubled	1
face.	1
	1
"No,	1
nothing."	1
	1
"You've	1
only	1
just	1
missed	1
him,"	1
said	1
the	1
orderly.	1
	1
The	1
headquarters	1
were	1
situated	1
two	1
miles	1
away	1
from	1
Salzeneck,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
without	1
returning	1
home,	1
took	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
there.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
inn	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
which	1
the	1
officers	1
frequented.	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
saw	1
Telyanin's	1
horse	1
at	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
was	1
sitting	1
over	1
a	1
dish	1
of	1
sausages	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you've	1
come	1
here	1
too,	1
young	1
man!"	1
he	1
said,	1
smiling	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
word;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
nearest	1
table.	1
	1
Both	1
were	1
silent.	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
Germans	1
and	1
a	1
Russian	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
No	1
one	1
spoke	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
heard	1
were	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
knives	1
and	1
the	1
munching	1
of	1
the	1
lieutenant.	1
	1
When	1
Telyanin	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
lunch	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
double	1
purse	1
and,	1
drawing	1
its	1
rings	1
aside	1
with	1
his	1
small,	1
white,	1
turned-up	1
fingers,	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
gold	1
imperial,	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
waiter.	1
	1
"Please	1
be	1
quick,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
coin	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
one.	1
Rostov	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
your	1
purse,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
almost	1
inaudible,	1
voice.	1
	1
With	1
shifting	1
eyes	1
but	1
eyebrows	1
still	1
raised,	1
Telyanin	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
purse.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
a	1
nice	1
purse.	1
Yes,	1
yes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
growing	1
suddenly	1
pale,	1
and	1
added,	1
"Look	1
at	1
it,	1
young	1
man."	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
purse	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
examined	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Telyanin.	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
was	1
looking	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
way	1
and	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
grow	1
very	1
merry.	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
get	1
to	1
Vienna	1
I'll	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
but	1
in	1
these	1
wretched	1
little	1
towns	1
there's	1
nowhere	1
to	1
spend	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Well,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it,	1
young	1
man,	1
I'm	1
going."	1
	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
speak.	1
	1
"And	1
you?	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
lunch	1
too?	1
They	1
feed	1
you	1
quite	1
decently	1
here,"	1
continued	1
Telyanin.	1
"Now	1
then,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it."	1
	1
He	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
purse.	1
Rostov	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
it.	1
Telyanin	1
took	1
the	1
purse	1
and	1
began	1
carelessly	1
slipping	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
his	1
riding	1
breeches,	1
with	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
lifted	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
slightly	1
open,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say,	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
am	1
putting	1
my	1
purse	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
and	1
that's	1
quite	1
simple	1
and	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
else's	1
business."	1
	1
"Well,	1
young	1
man?"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
and	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
lifted	1
brows	1
he	1
glanced	1
into	1
Rostov's	1
eyes.	1
	1
Some	1
flash	1
as	1
of	1
an	1
electric	1
spark	1
shot	1
from	1
Telyanin's	1
eyes	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
and	1
back,	1
and	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
in	1
an	1
instant.	1
	1
"Come	1
here,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
Telyanin's	1
arm	1
and	1
almost	1
dragging	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
"That	1
money	1
is	1
Denisov's;	1
you	1
took	1
it..."	1
he	1
whispered	1
just	1
above	1
Telyanin's	1
ear.	1
	1
"What?	1
What?	1
How	1
dare	1
you?	1
What?"	1
said	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
But	1
these	1
words	1
came	1
like	1
a	1
piteous,	1
despairing	1
cry	1
and	1
an	1
entreaty	1
for	1
pardon.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Rostov	1
heard	1
them,	1
an	1
enormous	1
load	1
of	1
doubt	1
fell	1
from	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
glad,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
began	1
to	1
pity	1
the	1
miserable	1
man	1
who	1
stood	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
task	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
completed.	1
	1
"Heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
the	1
people	1
here	1
may	1
imagine,"	1
muttered	1
Telyanin,	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
moving	1
toward	1
a	1
small	1
empty	1
room.	1
"We	1
must	1
have	1
an	1
explanation..."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
shall	1
prove	1
it,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"I..."	1
	1
Every	1
muscle	1
of	1
Telyanin's	1
pale,	1
terrified	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
quiver,	1
his	1
eyes	1
still	1
shifted	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
downward	1
look	1
not	1
rising	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
face,	1
and	1
his	1
sobs	1
were	1
audible.	1
	1
"Count!...	1
Don't	1
ruin	1
a	1
young	1
fellow...	1
here	1
is	1
this	1
wretched	1
money,	1
take	1
it..."	1
He	1
threw	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
old	1
father	1
and	1
mother!..."	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
money,	1
avoiding	1
Telyanin's	1
eyes,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
then	1
retraced	1
his	1
steps.	1
"O	1
God,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
"how	1
could	1
you	1
do	1
it?"	1
	1
"Count..."	1
said	1
Telyanin	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Don't	1
touch	1
me,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
drawing	1
back.	1
"If	1
you	1
need	1
it,	1
take	1
the	1
money,"	1
and	1
he	1
threw	1
the	1
purse	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inn.	1
